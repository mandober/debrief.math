# natural transformation

Just as a functor is a morphism between categories, a natural transformation is a 2-morphism between two functors.

Natural transformations are the 2-morphisms in the 2-category `Cat`.

A natural transformation provides a way of transforming one functor into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e. the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved.

If `F` and `G` are functors between the categories `C` and `D`, 
`F,G : C -> D`,    
then a natural transformation    
`η : F -> G`    
associates    
to every object `a` in `C`    
a morphism `ηᵃ : F a → G a` in `D`    

a ⟼ ηᵃ : F a → G a     

such that   
for every morphism    
`f : a → b` in `C`,    

`ηᵇ ∘ F f = G f ∘ ηᵃ`

This means that the following diagram is commutative:

```
F a -----------> F b
|       F f        |
|                  |
|ηᵃ              ηᵇ|
|                  |
|                  |
↓       G f        ↓
G a -----------> G b
```

The two functors `F` and `G` are called **naturally isomorphic** 
if there exists a natural transformation 
from `F` to `G` such that 
`ηᵃ` is an isomorphism 
for every object `∀a ∈ Ob(C)`.

>∃η : F → G. ηᵃ is an isomorphism ∀a ∈ Ob(C) ==> F ∧ G are naturally isomorphic
