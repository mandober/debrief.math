# Fundamental concepts

The 3 fundamental concepts at the heart of category theory:
- Category
- Functor
- Natural Transformation


A *category* is the main object of concern, it consists of a network of arrow-connected objects.

A *functor* is a mapping between categories that preserves strutcure. A functor maps both objects and arrows in a category; it maps objects to objects, and arrows to arrows.

A *natural transformation* is a another mapping, this time between functors.

Acquired terminology:
- category theory
- category
- object
- arrow, morphism
- composition of arrows
- associativity of arrow composition
- identity arrow, identity wrt arrow composition
- functor
- natural transformation
