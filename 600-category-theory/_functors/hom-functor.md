# Hom-functor

If `C` is a locally small category, then its hom-functor is the functor

`hom : (Cᵒᵖ × C) → Set`

from the product category `Cᵒᵖ × C` (of the category `C` with its opposite category `Cᵒᵖ`) to the category `Set`, which sends

- an object `(c,c') ∈ Cᵒᵖ × C`, i.e. a pair of objects in `C`, to the hom-set `Homᶜ(c,c')` in Set, the set of morphisms `q : c → c'` in C
