A **strict initial object** is an initial object (`0`) of a category C with the property that every morphism in C with codomain 0, `∀X ∈ C. X -> 0` is an isomorphism.

- If C is a Cartesian closed category, every initial object is strict.
- If C is a distributive or extensive category, then the initial object 0 of C is strict.


The dual concept is that of *strict terminal object*:
