# Initial and terminal objects

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_and_terminal_objects

An **initial object** of a category `𝒞` is an object `I` in `𝒞` such that for every object `X` in `𝒞`, there exists precisely one morphism `I → X`.

A **terminal object** of a category `𝒞` is an object `T` in `𝒞` such that for every object `X` in `𝒞`, there exists precisely one morphism `X → T`.

Initial and terminal objects are duals. 
A terminal object is also called *terminal element* or *final object*. 
An initial object is also called *coterminal object* or *universal object*.

If an object is both initial and terminal, it is called a *zero object* or *null object*. A pointed category has a zero object.

A **strict initial object** `I` is one for which every morphism into `I` is an *isomorphism*.

## Examples

*The empty set* is **the unique initial object** in `Set`.

*Every singleton set* is a **terminal object** in `Set`.

`Set` has no zero objects.

*The empty space* is **the unique initial object** in `Top`, the category of topological spaces. Every *one-point space* is a **terminal object** in `Top`.
