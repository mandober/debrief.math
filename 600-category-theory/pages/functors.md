# Functors

A category is a collection of objects and arrows between the objects. 
Arrows map objects to objects in the same category; each object has an *identity arrow* that maps that object back to itself.

So in a category `โ`, there are objects `a,b,c โ Ob(โ)`, and there are arrows, e.g. `f : a -> b` and `g : b -> c`, so `f,g โ Ar(โ)`, where the compatible arrows (like f and g) are composed as `g โ f`. And identity arrows map objects back to themselves, e.g. `1แต : a -> a`.



At a higher level, we have *functors* that map between categories. A functor that maps a category back to itself is an *endofunctor*. In general, a functor `F` maps a category `โ` to a category `๐ป` by mapping:

A functor `F : โ -> ๐ป` maps
- objects in โ to objects in ๐ป
  - a,b,c โ Ob(โ)
  - a โผ F a
  - b โผ F b
- arrows in โ to arrows in ๐ป
  - f : a -> b โ Ar(โ)
  - f โผ F f
  - 1แต โผ F 1แต = 1 ๊ฐโ

Functors are in fact structure-preserving mappings, meaning they preserve:
- identities, 1แต โผ F 1แต and `F 1แต = 1 ๊ฐโ`
- composition
  - f : a -> b โ Ar(โ), so f โผ F f
  - g : b -> c โ Ar(โ), so g โผ F g
  - g โ f : a -> c โ Ar(โ), so g โ f โผ F (g โ f), and `F (g โ f) = F g โ F f`

There is a special endofunctor called the **identity functor**, `I` that maps a category back to itself, `Iแถ : โ -> โ`, or `Iแดฐ : ๐ป -> ๐ป`.

>The identity functor on a category `โ` is the functor `Iแถ : โ โ โ` that maps each object and morphism of `โ` back to itself.

The identity functor on a category โ is denoted `Iแถ` (or `1แถ` or `idแถ`).

The identity functors are the identities of composition of functors in `Cat`.

*Composition of functors* (in `Cat`)
- identity functors are units of composition of functors
- F : โ -> ๐ป
- G : ๐ป -> ๐ผ
- `G โ F : โ -> ๐ผ`
