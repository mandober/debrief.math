There are   known   knowns - things we       know we       know. 
There are   known unknowns - things we       know we don't know. 
There are unknown unknowns - things we don't know we don't know. 
There are unknown   knowns - things we don't know we       know. 
And then there is category theory.

## Set category

The category `𝗦𝗲𝘁` seems the most suited to ease us in into category theory, as it abstracts very familiar mathematical objects. `𝗦𝗲𝘁` is a category with sets as objects and functions as morphisms. It is the abstraction of the set of all sets; well, not really the set of all sets, as that would invite the Russell's paradox, but rather the class of all sets.

For enhanced clarity, we'll have a side-by-side views into this collection, both from the set-theoretical (as the class of all sets) and from the category-theoretical perspective (as the `𝗦𝗲𝘁` category).

Under the view-as-set, we can discern the structure of each set (its elements), while each function is presented by its individual mappings (each mapping is a directed line that goes from an element of one to an element of another set).

This same collection, that now looks terribly busy, becomes greatly simplified when we switch our perspective to the categorical view - each set dissolves into a single structureless point, while the multitude of arrows that made up each function integrate into a single arrow.

## Category theory

The categorical perspective emerged in mathematics in 1945 when Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane published their radical paper, "General Theory of Natural Equivalences." It proposed a deeply unconventional idea, arguing that mathematics needed to do away with the equal sign, and the whole simplistic notion of equality, and replace it with the deeper, more sophisticated idea of "equivalence."

Instead of calling two things exactly equal, Eilenberg and Mac Lane urged mathematicians to embrace sophisticated new mathematical structures that captured the many ways in which two things might be the same, or equivalent.

The proposal was received with skepticism. Riehl, an associate professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University, says that many early readers of Eilenberg and Mac Lane's work wondered, "Is this even mathematics?"

But the doubts didn't persist for long. Today, category theory and its next-generation version, higher category theory, are central to many fields of math, from algebraic geometry to mathematical physics. In those areas, Riehl said, "I think it would be impossible to describe the kind of basic objects of study without categorical language."

In higher category theory, mathematicians like Riehl don't just think about ways in which two objects are equivalent. They also think about equivalences between equivalences, and equivalences between equivalences between equivalences, and so on upward in a never-ending tower of relationships. These equivalence relationships are captured in an abstract mathematical object called an infinity category.

## Category theory

The huge difference in the levels of abstraction between set theory and category theory is perhaps similar to a zoomed-out view through a telescope, which shows a spot of light; but, as you zoom in, it dissolves into shapes, until, you finally discern that it was a star with a pair of orbiting planets all along.

We usually have a detailed view of objects that are the central point of interest of many mathematical theories. In mathematical areas such as set theory, relation theory, order theory, graph theory, abstract algebra, etc., the main objects of study are viewed zoomed-in - most importantly, we can discern their structure.

In abstract algebra, algebraic structures (magma, semi-group, group, ring, field, lattice, …) are based on a set with additional structure attached, and we investigate these structures in a full-color full-detail HD view.

On the other hand, category theory attempts to become a universal language of math. A language that can be applied to all areas of math, meaning it can be efficiently used to successfully describe a particular field, as well as to successfully realte different fields. Only then it can start to realize its cental goal - discovering equivalences between seemingly unrelated areas of math. Finding such equivalences would boost progress of a new or stuck theory by allowing it to reuse the already available methods (from its eq theory).

To achieve that goal, it is understandable that category theory must work at a sufficiently high level of abstraction because only then will the commonalities between different math areas appear.

Quanta magazine: What is the difference between equivalence and equality, and what's gained by thinking about equivalence?

Emily Riehl: Over time, mathematicians have developed an increasingly flexible view of what it means for two objects to be "the same." In a sense, this progression is inevitable as mathematical objects become increasingly sophisticated. Two objects in a higher category should be considered "the same" when they are equivalent. This essentially means "seen as the same by all other objects in the higher category." What's subtle is that an equivalence between two objects should be recorded as additional data.

Emily Riehl's forthcoming book, `Elements of ∞-Category Theory`

>The fundamental theorem of category theory 
says that any mathematical object no matter how complicated 
can be understood, that is, it can be uniquely characterized 
by its relationship to the other objects in its category.

You can think of a category as providing a linguistic template for a mathematical theory, with nouns and verbs and such, but as the objects of study become more complicated, we'll also need a more robust linguistic template that has adjectives, adverbs, and so on, and that's roughly the idea behind an *infinity category*.

But in addition to objects and arrows, which we think of as being 0 and 1 dimensional, we have 2-dimensional arrows (as arrows between arrows) inhabiting
a 2D space, and then there are arrows between arrows between arrows, which we think of as inhabiting the 3D space, and arrows between arrows between arrows between arrows …, all the way and beyond infinity!
