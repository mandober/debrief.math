# Category theory :: Brief

- A category is about structure, it defines what a structure means.
- The essence of category theory is composition of various entities.
- Composable mappings are the essence of categories.
- Category theory is one of the most (if not the most) abstract branches of mathematics, affectionately called abstract nonsense.
- Categories are just another algebraic structure, generalising both monoids and partial orders.

>The essence of category theory are composable mappings between various categorical entities.
