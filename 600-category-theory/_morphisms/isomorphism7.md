# Isomorphism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism_(category_theory)



In category theory, given a category `C`, an isomorphism is a morphism, `f : a -> b`, that has an inverse morphism `g : b -> a`, that is, fg=1ᵦ and gf=1ₐ.



For example, a bijective linear map is an isomorphism between vector spaces, and a bijective continuous function whose inverse is also continuous is an isomorphism between topological spaces, called a homeomorphism.

Two categories C and D are isomorphic if there exist functors `F : C -> D` and `G : D-> C` which are mutually inverse to each other, that is, 

FG=1_{D}
(the identity functor on D) and 

GF=1_{C}

(the identity functor on C)





The concept of isomorphism generalizes the concept of bijection from 𝗦𝗲𝘁 (the category of sets) to a general category.

An isomorphism is an invertible morphism - it is a morphism that is also an inverse of itself.
