# Category theory :: Definitions :: Objects

A category is a collection of objects and arrows between them.

The collection of objects of a category ℂ is denoted by `Ob(ℂ)`, that is, all objects in ℂ may be denoted by `∀c ∈ Ob(ℂ)`.

Objects in a category are just abstract mathematical objects, stripped of all the structure they may have once possessed - that is, they are viewed as structureless blobs and are thus represented by featureless dots. Any property of an object is instead related by the arrows coming into it. And the totality of relations between two objects are related by the set of all arrows between them, as well as between all other objects in a category. In short, objects are descibed by arrows.

Category theory prefers to look at the objects as featureless blobs, but they may also be seen as having some structure when this improves understanding. For example, `Set` is a category of all sets, and all objects, which are sets, are just dots, leving it to the arrows that connect them to rely their features. But for learning, the objects (sets) may be, at least temporarily, looked from the set theoretic perspective in order to discern their elements. Amazingly, it is not needed to lower your vantage point to the set theoretic perspective - everything about the sets (objects) can be inferred from the high abstraction vantage point of CT.
