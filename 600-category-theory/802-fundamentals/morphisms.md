# Morphisms

Morphisms are also called arrows, sometimes mappings or maps.

Morphisms are to be interpreted as relations between objects. 

We best avoid the standard set-theoretical notation `f(a) = b` because it may lead to false conclusions; e.g. `f : a → b` and `g : a → b` are two different morphisms (functions). The notation `f(a) = b` and `g(a) = b` leads to the incorrect conclusion that `f = g`.

For instance, if `a = b = ℝ` then two functions `f(x) = x` and `g(x) = −x` define two different orderings on `ℝ` and must not be considered the same function (morphism).

Given `f : a → b`, obj `a` is domain, `dom f`, and `b` is codomain, `cod f`.
