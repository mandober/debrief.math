# List of order theory topics - Wikipedia

Order theory is a branch of mathematics that studies various kinds of objects (often binary relations) that capture the intuitive notion of ordering, providing a framework for saying when one thing is "less than" or "precedes" another.
__[Order theory][1]__ is a branch of [mathematics][2] that studies various kinds of objects (often [binary relations][3]) that capture the intuitive notion of ordering, providing a framework for saying when one thing is "less than" or "precedes" another.

An alphabetical list of many notions of order theory can be found in the [order theory glossary][4]. See also [inequality][5], [extreme value][6] and [mathematical optimization][7].
