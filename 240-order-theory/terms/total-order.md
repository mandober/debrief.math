# Total order

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order

A **total order** (linear order) is a partial order in which any two elements are comparable.

That is, a total order is a binary relation `<=` on a set `S`, which satisfies the following axioms:
1. Reflexive,          ∀a ∈ S  . a<=a
2. Antisymmetric       ∀ab ∈ S . a<=b ⋀ b<=a -> a = b
3. Transitive,         ∀abc ∈ S. a<=b ⋀ b<=c -> a<=c
4. Strongly connected, ∀ab ∈ S . a<=b ⋁ b<=a

A total order is called linear order, simple order, connex, or full order.

A set equipped with a total order is called a *totally ordered set* (simply ordered set, linearly ordered set, `loset`); *chain* is sometimes also used as a synonym, although it generally refers to some sort of totally ordered subsets of a given poset.

An extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a *linear extension* of that partial order.
