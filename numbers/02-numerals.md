# Numerals

* Numeral is a written symbol that represents a number.



## Numerals
A *numeral* is the notational symbol that represents a number. It is just an arbitrarily chosen glyph, a smudge on some medium (stone, paper, screen) devoid of any inherent meaning[^1].

A *numeral system* is an organized way to write and manipulate numeric symbols. The prevalent numeral system today is the **Hindu–Arabic numeral system** that uses 10 numerals (0-9) to represent all natural numbers. To achieve this, it allows combining of individual numerals to represent numbers bigger then 9.

Numeral system (system of numeration) is a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems.



The written representation of a number is understood universally in today's world, allowing mathematics to exists independently of any language; as opposed to the verbal representation of a number that varies wildly across languages.



The choice of a particular symbol used to represent a particular number is arbitrary; an Arabic set of symbols was agreed upon, so today's worldwide standard for written numeric representation came to be the set of symbols we're all familiar with. We could have as well ended up using a drastically different set of symbols; maybe soon, we can set up a simulation to mimic the development of a civilization and witness the other interesting outcomes.




uses the positional system

allows combinations of numerical digits like "5" and "0" to represent larger numbers like 50.

[1]: The Hindu–Arabic numerals were not completely arbitrary; earlier iterations of symbols did try to convey some meaning, between a numeral and a number, by constructing each numeral to have the same number of angles as the number it represented. The required number of angles does emerge with assistance of strategically placed serifs and straightening of the curves.
- 0 was written as a (middle) dot
- 1, when written in sans-serif font (without the "slab"), has 1 angle
- 2 looked more as a "Z"
- 3 was a 90-degrees left-rotated W
- 4 is written with the upper part closing into a triangle
- 5 as a flattened out 5 with a stalagmite;
- the same for 6, except it features a stalactite instead;
- 7 comes with two extra lines, bottom and middle;
- 8 has squared, digital clock style;
- 9 gets mutilated downstairs: after a steady growth, a stalagmite confuses directions taking a sharp turn right only to replace itself with a stalagmite.
