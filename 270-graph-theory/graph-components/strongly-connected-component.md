# Strongly connected component

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component

In *directed graphs*, a graph is said to be **strongly connected** if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.

The *strongly connected components* of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into *subgraphs* that are themselves strongly connected.

It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a graph, or to find its strongly connected components, in linear time, Î˜(V+E).
