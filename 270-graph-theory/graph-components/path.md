# Path

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(graph_theory)

In a graph, a **path** is a sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices.

By most definitions, vertices in a path are considered to be distinct (and since the vertices are distinct, so are the edges), although this can be made explicit by using the term *tour*.

A directed path (sometimes called *dipath*) in a directed graph is a sequence of edges which joins a sequence of distinct vertices, but with the added restriction that the edges be all directed in the same direction.
