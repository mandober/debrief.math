# Bipartite graph

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph

A **bipartite graph** (or **bigraph**) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets `U` and `V`, such that every edge connects a vertex in `U` to a vertex in `V`. Vertex sets `U` and `V` are usually called the *parts of the graph*. Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph without *odd-length cycles*.

* A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that the vertices in one set are not connected to each other, but may be connected to vertices in the other set.
* A bipartite graph is a graph without odd cycles.
* A bipartite graph is a graph that may be properly colored with 2 colors.

Bipartite graphs may be written `G = ⟨U,V,E⟩`, where `U` and `V` are the subsets of vertices of each color. However, unless the graph is connected, it may not have a unique 2-coloring.
