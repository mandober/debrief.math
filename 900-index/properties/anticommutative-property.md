# Anticommutative property

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticommutative_property

**Anticommutativity** is a specific property of some non-commutative operations.

* In mathematical physics, where symmetry is of central importance, these operations are mostly called antisymmetric operations, and are extended in an associative setting to cover more than two arguments.

* Swapping the position of two arguments of an antisymmetric operation yields a result which is the inverse of the result with unswapped arguments.

* The notion inverse refers to a group structure on the operation's codomain, possibly with another operation, such as addition.

Subtraction is an anticommutative operation.

```
a - b = c
b - a = d
---------
d = c⁻¹
c = d⁻¹


  a - b  ≠ b - a
−(a − b) = b − a
```


A prominent example of an anticommutative operation is the Lie bracket.
