# About combinatorics

* A **combination** is a selection of items from a set that has distinct members such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike permutations where the order matters). More formally, a `k`-combination of a set `S` is a subset of `k` distinct elements of `S`, denoted `nCk` or `C(n,k)` and read "`n` choose `k`" (choose `k` items from a set of `n` elements).
* `n` is the number of elements in the set and the upper bound of `k`, i.e. `k` can go from 0 to `n`, although pairs of selections yield the same result as encoded by the Pascal's triangle.

n-choose-0 = n-choose-(n - k)

 Thus, `k` can take any value from 0 to `n`, `k ≤ n` (i.e. k=0..n).
* A concrete selection `nCk` is denoted e.g. `5C3`, and results in a single value.
