Pascals triangle embeds/represents
- rows
  - each row is a power of 2: 0th row is 0, 1st is 1
  - rows numbering starts from 0
  - nth row contains n+1 elements
- binomial coefficients
  - each row lists the coefficients of a polynomial, ax‚Åø + cx‚Åø‚Åª¬πy‚Åø‚Åª¬π + ‚Ä¶ + zy‚Åø
- binimial distribution
  - number of samples of size k from n objects, n-choose-k
  - 12-choose-5 is given by the 6th element in the 12th row
- ‚ÅøC‚Çñ or `n-choose-k` for 0 <= k <= n
- superset
- partiations of a set
- number of elements in the powerset
- n = |S|, m = |ùìü(S)|

Notation
- row, `r`
- rows are indexed by `n` (2nd element in each row), row ordinal: `n`, 0 <= n
- row cardinality, `c`, |r‚Çô| = c‚Çô = n+1
- row parity, `r·ê©` even, `r‚Åª` odd: r‚Çô = odd if n is even and vv
- ‚ÅøC‚Çñ or n-choose-k (for 0 <= k <= n) is the num of combinations of n elements


Properties
- the 1's on both sides may be thought of as being surrounded with implicit 0's, if needed for computation, however the zeros are not part of the structure
- each row holds its ordinal number, n, as the second entry
- Row parity
  - rows toggle between odd and even rows, according to the num of elements
  - the zeroth row is odd, the first is even
- the sum of each row is a power of two, 2‚Åø, starting with n=0
- each row is mirrored around the center which is a single number or a pair
- each row has n+1 elements
- also encodes Fibbinacci numbers with the so-called shallow diagonals
- save for 1, any other num appears up to a certain row
  e.g. 10 may appear up to row 10 (it has 4 occurances total)
- PT mod 2 encodes Sierpinski's triangle (odds as holes)
- interp rows in diff base/radix or place value acc to element position
  numbers (like 21) as place values (21*10‚Åø) of base 10 give powers of 11
  [1,5,10,10,5,1] ~~> 11‚Åµ = 161051
  `1*10‚Åµ + 5*10‚Å¥ + 10*10¬≥ + 10*10¬≤ + 5*10¬π + 1*10‚Å∞`
   = 100000+50000+10000+1000+50+1 = 161051


```
[1]         = 11‚Å∞ = 1
[1,1]         = 11¬π = 11
[1,2,1]         = 11¬≤ = 121
[1,3,3,1]          = 11¬≥ = 1331
[1,4,6,4,1]         = 11‚Å¥ = 14641
[1,5,10,10,5,1]      = 11‚Åµ = 161051

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. In much of the Western world, it is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although other mathematicians studied it centuries before him in India, Persia, China, Germany, Italy.

The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with the zeroth row, `n = 0`, at the top, following from the fact that 2‚Åø is the sum of the numbers in the nth row, with row number, n, itself located as the second (and second to last) entry in each row.

The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with `k = 0` and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows.

The triangle may be constructed in the following manner: in row 0 (top row), there is a unique nonzero entry 1. Each entry of each subsequent row is constructed by adding the above-left and above-right numbers, treating blank entries as 0. As a formula, it is:

$$\displaystyle{{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}}$$

An entry (element, value) in the nth row and kth column of Pascal's triangle is denoted $$\binom{n}{k}$$ (read: "n choose k").


$$
\displaystyle{
^{n} \! \operatorname{C} _{k} = 
\binom {n} {k} = 
\binom {n} {n-k} = 
\frac {n!} {(n-k)! \ k!} =
\frac 
{ n \cdot (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1) }
{ k \cdot (k-1) \cdots 1      }
}
$$
