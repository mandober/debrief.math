# Arithmetic operations

- Arithmetic operations
  - 4 elementary operations
    - 2 primary operations
      - `+` addition: addendum + addens = sum
      - `×` multiplication: factor × multiplier = product
    - 2 operations in terms of these
      - `-` subtraction: minuend - subtrahend = difference
        - subtraction in terms of addition: x - y = x + (-y)
        - subtraction is addition with the inverted (negated) subtrahend
      - `÷` division: nominator ÷ denominator = quotient
        - division in terms of multiplication: x ÷ y = x × 1/y
        - division is mul with the inverted (reciprocal) factor

- iteration
  - successor, x + 1
  - predecessor, x - 1
  - addition: x + y iterate +1 y times on x
  - mul: iterated addition, x × n = x + x + … + x (n times)
    - n is a multiplier, n ∈ ℤ
- additional operations
    - exponentiation, power
      - square,      `x²`, x to the second power
      - cube,        `x³`, x to the third power
      - n-sqaure-x,  `xⁿ`, x to the n-th power
    - root
      - square root, `√x`
      - cube root,   `∛x`
      - fourth root, `∜x`
      - nth-root,    `ⁿ√x`, n is the radix, x is the radical
    - logarithm
      - log₂ or lg
      - log₁₀ or log
      - logₑ or ln
    - percentage
    - signum
    - absolute value
    - inverses
      - inverse of x is `-x`, additive inverse
      - reciprocal of x is `1/x`, multiplicative inverse
  * Hyperoperations
    - Hyperop-0, successor                             `x+1`
    - Hyperop-1, addition                              `x+y`
    - Hyperop-2, multiplication,                       `x∙y`
    - Hyperop-3, exponentiation, `x ↑ y`,              `xʸ`
    - Hyperop-4, tetratiation,   `x ↑↑ y`,   `x ↑² y`, `ʸx`
    - Hyperop-5, pentation,      `x ↑↑↑ y`,  `x ↑³ y`
    - Hyperop-6, hexation,       `x ↑↑↑↑ y`, `x ↑⁴ y`
    - Hyperop-n,                             `x ↑ⁿ y`
