# Real numbers

- every real number can be written as the limit of a sequence of rationals

- The sequence (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, …), e.g. approaches the number 1
- In fact, every real number can be written as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers (e.g. via its decimal expansion, see Completeness Of The Real Numbers).
- `π` is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, …), which is increasing. A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of π, that is, (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, …). Unlike the preceding sequence, this sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by inspection.



Real numbers axioms: a non-empty set ℝ together with operation `+` and `×` and the ordering relation, `≤` that satisfies:
1. (ℝ, +, 0) is an Abelian group
2. (ℝ, ×, 1) is an Abelian group
3. `×` distributes over `+`
4. `≤` is a total order compatible with `+`, `×` and Archimedian property
5. Every Cauchy sequence converges
6. Triangle inequality: |x+y| ≤ |x| + |y|
