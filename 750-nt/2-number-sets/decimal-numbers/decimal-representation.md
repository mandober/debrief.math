A **decimal representation (expansion)** of a non-negative real number `r` is its expression as a sequence of symbols consisting of decimal digits traditionally written with a single separator:

r = bkbk−1⋯b0.a1a2⋯ 

where
- `.` is the *decimal separator* or *decimal period*
, `k` is a nonnegative integer, and 
b0,⋯,bk,a1,a2,⋯ are digits, which are numerals representing integers in the range 0..9.

Commonly, 
b
k
≠
0
bk≠0 if 
k
≥
1.
k≥1. The sequence of the 
a
i
ai-the digits after the dot-is generally infinite. If it is finite, the lacking digits are assumed to be 0. If all 
a
i
ai are 0, the separator is also omitted, resulting in a finite sequence of digits, which represents a natural number.

The decimal representation represents the infinite sum:

Every nonnegative real number has at least one such representation; it has two such representations (with 
b
k
≠
0
bk≠0 if 
k
>
0
k>0) if and only if one has a trailing infinite sequence of 0, and the other has a trailing infinite sequence of 9. For having a one-to-one correspondence between nonnegative real numbers and decimal representations, decimal representations with a trailing infinite sequence of 9 are sometimes excluded.[1]
