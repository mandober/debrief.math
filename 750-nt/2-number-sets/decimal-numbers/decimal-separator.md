# Decimal separator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator

A **decimal separator** (decimal point) is a symbol that separates the integer part from the fractional part of a number written in decimal form.

This symbol and related notions have fallen out of math into the jurisdiction of a *locale* since different symbols are used in this role in different cultures. Dot and comma seem to be preferred in this role (although already a binary choice is sufficient to make a mess of notations; never the lack of ambiguities).

Different countries officially designate different symbols for use as the separator. The choice of this symbol also affects the choice of symbol for the *thousands separator* used in *digit grouping*.

Any such symbol may also be called
- decimal sign
- decimal mark
- decimal marker
- decimal separator
- radix point (ssn)
- decimal point/period/dot (symbol-specific name)
- decimal comma (ssn)

Symbol-specific names are also used; decimal point and decimal comma refer to a dot (either baseline or middle) and comma respectively, when it is used as a decimal separator; these are the usual terms used in English, with the aforementioned generic terms reserved for abstract usage.

In many contexts, when a number is spoken, the function of the separator is assumed by the spoken name of the symbol: comma or point in most cases. In some specialized contexts, the word "decimal" is instead used for this purpose.

In mathematics, the decimal separator is a type of *radix point*, a term that also applies to number systems with bases other than ten.
