https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal

The decimal numeral system (aka the base-10 positional numeral system, or *denary* /ˈdiːnəri/, or decanary) is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers.

It is the extension to non-integer numbers (decimal fractions) of the *Hindu-Arabic numeral system*. The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as *decimal notation*.
