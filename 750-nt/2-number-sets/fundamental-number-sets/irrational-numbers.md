# Irrational numbers

## The First Sign of Trouble: Irrational Numbers in Geometry

Philosophers during this period (and beforehand) explored many applications of the relationship that is now known as the *Pythagorean theorem*.

It made perfect sense to them that every possible length should be able to be expressed as, at the least, a fraction of some whole amount.

This can easily be argued without looking too deep. If you take a pencil and draw a line, then label that line with equally spaced whole numbers (we'll call this line "the number line"), then no matter where you place a point on that line, you should always be able to label it as being x times closer to 1 than to, say 2. It might not be a nice fraction like 1⁄4, but it should still be a fraction. After all, between every two rational numbers there was an infinitude of rational numbers. What other type of length could there be?

If `a` and `b` are rational numbers with `a < b`, then there exists a rational number `c` such that `a < c < b`.

At this time, the Pythagoreans, followers of the philosopher Pythagoras, were seeking out number patterns everywhere, due to the success of rational numbers in music. They were very interested in calculating triples, sets of 3 integers that satisfied the *Pythagorean theorem* `a² + b² = c²`.

Unfortunately, there was a very simple triangle that could actually be made, yet did not seem to fit into the Pythagorean theorem. If you measured out a square plot of land, no-one at this time could tell you exactly how far it was to walk across the diagonal of that square. While they could tell you that the distance was between two numbers, it was maddening that they could not assign a workable exact quantity to that length.

Occurences like this were actually kept very secret, and even up to the 19. century, irrational numbers (numbers that could not be expressed as ratios of whole numbers), were viewed with suspicion as in some way not being "real" numbers.

If a number is even, then the square of that number is also even. Show the same for odd numbers.
- ∀a ∈ ℤ. n = 2a + 1 ⇒ n odd
- ∀a ∈ ℤ. n = 2a + 0 ⇒ n even
- ∀n ∈ ℕ. n even ⇒ n² even

Two distinct numbers always have distinct prime factors. Said differently, two numbers with identical prime factors must be identical. This is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

Ex. Suppose `1 + 1 = c²` where `c = m/n` where `m,n ∈ ℕ`. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, show that this cannot be the case.


There are, in a sense that will be made clearer in Real Analysis, waaay more irrational numbers than rational numbers. Picking at random from the set ℝ, there is almost no chance to pick a rational number.

>Rational numbers are a few drops in the ocean of irrational numbers.

Irrational numbers disturbed early mathematicians among ancient Greeks, and some were killed for discussing them. Greeks have developed creative methods of getting as close as they needed to a true value of the irrational quantity using rational numbers. Methods such as those of Eudoxus and Archimedes are actually not that removed from calculus. Archimedes has developed the *method of exhaustion* that enabled him to make great estimatations of the area of a circle.
