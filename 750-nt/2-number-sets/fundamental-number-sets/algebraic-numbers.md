# Algebraic numbers

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Algebraic_number

An **algebraic number** is any complex number 
that is a root of a non-zero polynomial 
(that is, a value which causes the polynomial to equal zero) 
in one variable with rational coefficients 
(or equivalently, by clearing denominators, with integer coefficients).

The set of algebraic number, `𝔸 ⊂ ℂ`.

All ℤ and ℚ are algebraic, as are all roots of integers, √ℤ. 
The same is not true for all ℝ or all ℂ.

Those real and complex numbers which are not algebraic 
are called **transcendental numbers**. They include `π` and `e`.

While the set of complex numbers is uncountable, 
**the set of algebraic numbers is countable** 
and has measure zero in the Lebesgue measure 
as a subset of the complex numbers, and in this sense 
almost all complex numbers are transcendental.

* the golden ratio, `φ = (1 + √5) / 2`, is an algebraic number, because it is a root of the polynomial, `x² - x - 1`. That is, it is a value for `x` for which the polynomial evaluates to 0.

* the complex number `1 + i` is algebraic because it is a root of `x⁴ + 4`.

* `√2` is an algebraic number equal to the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 1; `x² = 1² + 1²` -> `x = √2`.
