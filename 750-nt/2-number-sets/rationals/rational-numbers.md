# Rational numbers

* A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction `p/q` of two integers, a numerator `p` and a non-zero denominator `q`. Now, it is best to let p ∈ ℤ and q ∈ ℕᐩ. With q ∈ ℕᐩ, it is guaranteed it cannot be zero. With `p ∈ ℤ`, the numerator gets to carry a potential sign. If that is a *canonical form*, then we can allow for the unary minus sign also on denumerator (during operations) with understanding that `p/-q = -p/q` and `-p/-q = p/q`.
* Since `q` may be equal to 1, every natural `n` is a rational number, `n/1`.
* Since `q` may be equal to 1, every integer `n` is a rational number, `n/1`.
* The set of all rational numbers is denoted by ℚ (q for quotient).
* Rationals may be expressed as fractions, `p/q`, which is their canonical form, but also as decimal numbers (i.e. in base 10), called decimal expansion, often needing the decimal point, which is followed by a number of digits.
* There is also a *mixed number form* consisting of an integer and a fraction, e.g. `1 1⁄2` where there is an implicit plus sign in between them, `1+1⁄2=3⁄2`.
* The *decimal expansion* of a rational number either:
  - terminates after a finite number of digits
  - infinitely repeats a particular *finite sequence of digits*
* A number that cannot be expressed according to above is called *irrational*, but they belong to ℝ, not ℚ. So, ℝ = ℚ ∪ irrationals, i.e. irrationals = ℝ∖ℚ
* Rationals are dense in the reals. This means that between any two real numbers there is a rational numbers. `∀ab ∈ ℝ. a < b. ∃r ∈ ℚ. a < r < b`, where the first `a < b` ensures that `a ≠ b`.
* Rationals may be build from the natural numbers by including a multiplicative inverse, `1/n`, for each nonzero integer `n`, along with the products formed by multiplying these inverses with integers.
* Fractions where known to Egyptians but they only used unit fractions, `1/n`, and exceptionally `2/3`. Any fraction can be formed using only unit fractions although its expression as unit fractions is not trivial. The method they used for calculating almost anything, especially fractions, was via doubling and they had special tables for some complicated operations.
