# Split-complex number

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-complex_number

In algebra, a split-complex number (or hyperbolic number, also perplex number, double number) is based on a hyperbolic unit `j` that satisfies `j² = 1`, where `j ≠ ±1`. A split-complex number has two real number components `x` and `y`, and is written `z=x+yj`. The conjugate of z is z∗=x−yj. Since j2=1, the product of a number z with its conjugate is N(z) := zz∗ = x²−y², an isotropic quadratic form.
