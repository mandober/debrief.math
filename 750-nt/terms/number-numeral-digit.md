# Number numeral digit

*Number* is an abstract quantity.

A *numeral system*, being a formal system, consist of an *alphabet*, which is a finite set of *symbols* from which elements are picked in order to construct possibly legal sequences (aka strings, words, formualas) according to the rules of a grammar. The grammar prescribes which constructions make sense, i.e. which are *well-formed formulas* (wffs), and which are gibberish.

*Digit* is a symbol in an alphabet of a numeral system.

*Numeral* is either a single symbol by itself, or a legal sequence of symbols that make a legal *number representation*.

Numbers are abstractions, but they have many concrete representations, many spoken representations, as well as written representations which both belong to a certain language. In fact, unlike the spoken number representations, written number representations are expressed the same way across many different languages, i.e. as Hindu-Arabic numerals (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). In that way numerals (and numbers) are more universal across cultures then other phenomena, although this is a relatively recent occurrence in the history.
