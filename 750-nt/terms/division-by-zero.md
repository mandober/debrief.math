- zero
- infinity, ±∞
- division by zero
- why cannot we divide by zero?
- indeterminate forms: 0/0, ∞/∞, ∞ - ∞, 0∙∞
- wheel algebra
  - bottom, nullity, ⊥
  - Riemann sphere
- alt reals
  - projective geometry
  - projective reals
  - extended reals
  - dual numbers
  - surreal numbers
  - hyperreal numbers



Approaching 0 from left we get aa different limit then from right, so no limit:
- lim{x→0ᐩ} 1/x = +∞
- lim{x→0⁻} 1/x = -∞

## Naive approach

`1/0 = x` (some unknown special number x), thus, `1 = 0 ∙ x`. This fails since no number satisfies this equation. But what about beyond reals? Like infinity? Maybe `1 = 0 × ∞`? But then we'd have

```js
1 = 0 * ∞
 1 / 0 =  ∞
-1 / 0 = -∞
 1 /-0 = -∞
 1 / 0 = -∞
```

So, 1 divided by 0 is both a positive and negative infinity.
