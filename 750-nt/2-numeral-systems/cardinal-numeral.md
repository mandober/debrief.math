In linguistics, and more precisely in traditional grammar, a **cardinal numeral**, or cardinal number word, is a part of speech used to count.

Examples in English are the words "one", "two", "three", and the compounds like "three hundred [and] forty-two" and "nine hundred [and] sixty".

Cardinal numerals are classified as *definite*, and are related to ordinal numbers, such as the English "first", "second", "third", etc.
