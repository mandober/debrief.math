# Fermat's last theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermats_last_theorem

Fermat's last theorem states that there are no solutions to `aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ` for `n > 2`.

- When n=0, there are no solutions, a⁰ + b⁰ = c⁰, since 1 + 1 ≠ 1
- When n=1, there are infinitely many (trivial) solutions, a + b = c
- When n=2, there are infinitely many solutions, `a² + b² = c²`

For n=2, we get *Pythagorean triples* of which there is an infinite number
- a² + b² = c²
- 3² + 4² = 5² = 9 + 16 = 25
- xa² + xb² = xc²
- x3² + x4² = x5²
- 2⋅3² + 2⋅4² = 2⋅5² = 18 + 32 = 50
