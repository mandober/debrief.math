# Bertrand's Postulate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrands_postulate

In number theory, Bertrand's postulate is a theorem stating that for any integer `3 < n`, there always exists at least one prime number `p` such that

    n < p < 2n - 2

A less restrictive formulation says for every `1 < n` there is always at least one prime `p` such that

    n < p < 2n

Another formulation, where `pₙ` is the nth prime, is for `1 ≤ n`

    pₙ﹢₁ + 1 < 2pₙ

This statement was first conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand (1822-1900). Bertrand himself verified his statement for all integers 2 ≤ n ≤ 3000000.

His conjecture was completely proved by Chebyshev 1852 and so the postulate is also called the *Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem* or *Chebyshev's theorem*.

Chebyshev's theorem can also be stated as a relation to `π` (prime-counting function) as the number of primes less than or equal to `x`: 

    1 ≤ π(x) − π(x/2)     (for x ≥ 2)

i.e. there is at least one prime between x and x/2.
