# Fermat's little theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermats_little_theorem

Fermat's little theorem states that if `p` is a prime number, then for any integer `n`, the number `nᵖ − n` is an integer multiple of `p`.

`nᵖ ≡ n (mod p)`

If `n` is not divisible by `p`, that is, if `n` is coprime to `p`, Fermat's little theorem is equivalent to the statement that `nᵖ⁻¹ - 1` is an integer multiple of `p`

`nᵖ⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod p)`
