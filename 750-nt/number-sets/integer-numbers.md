# Integers

Integers may be build from the natural numbers by including the additive inverse, `−n` for each nonzero natural number `n`.

The integers form a set ℤ with the following properties:
1. There is an order on ℤ that is transitive and has trichotomy.
2. If S is a set of integers with at least one element and at least one lower bound, then S has a minimum.
3. If n, m ∈ ℤ, there is a unique integer n + m.
4. Addition is associative.
5. Addition is commutative.
6. There is an additive identity in ℤ.
7. If n ∈ ℤ, then n has an additive inverse.
8. If k, n, m ∈ ℤ and n < m, then n + k < m + k.
9. If n, m ∈ ℤ, there is a unique integer n ⋅ m.
10. Multiplication is associative.
11. Multiplication is commutative.
12. There is an multiplicative identity in ℤ.
13. If k, n, m ∈ ℤ, n < m, and k is greater than an additive identity, then n ⋅ k < m ⋅ k.
14. If k, n, m ∈ ℤ, then k ⋅ (n + m) = k ⋅ n + k ⋅ m.
15. If n, m ∈ ℤ with nm equal to an additive identity, then one of n or m is equal to an additive identity. (ℤ has no divisors of 0)
16. The additive identity and the multiplicative identity are not equal

Notice that we require that the integers have an additive identity but not require it be unique. That is because we can prove it with the definition.

- The additive identity of ℤ is unique.
- The multiplicative identity of ℤ is unique.
- If a ∈ ℤ, its additive inverse is unique to it.
- If n ∈ ℤ, then n∙0 = 0 = 0∙n

If a, b ∈ ℤ, then
1. −(−a) = a
2. −a = (−1)a
3. −(a + b) = (−a) + (−b)
4. −(ab) = (−a)b = a(−b)

Multiplying an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality: `∀k,n,m ∈ ℤ. (n < m ⋀ k < 0 --> kn > km)`

If S is a set of integers with at least one element and at least one lower
bound, then S has a minimum.
