# Number Theory

*Number theory* studies the integers, integer-valued functions and the properties of mathematical objects built from integers (‚Ñ§, ‚Ñö), or defined as generalizations of the integers (algebraic integers, ùî∏).

Integers are a set - the set of integral numbers - built by extending the set of the natural numbers with negative numbers. So, *set theory* is a prerequisite to number theory. Algebra is another prerequisite, especialy *abstract algebra* with its subfields including groups, rings, fields. *Mathematical logic* is used as well, like in all math branches. In brief, number theory uses: sets, fundamental number sets (‚Ñï, ‚Ñ§, ‚Ñö, ‚Ñù, ‚ÑÇ), functions, orders, groups, rings, fields, and touches on sequences, continuity, limits, series, power series, derivatives.
