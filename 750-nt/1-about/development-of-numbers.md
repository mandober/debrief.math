# Development of numbers

One way to understand the development of numbers is to understand the questions which prompted their discovery:
- enumeration or counting leads us to natural numbers, and zero.
- accounting leads us to negative numbers
- fractions also come from commerce or manufacture; splitting into fractions
- analytic 2D geometry lead to irrationals; triangles can have irrational sides
- algebra lead to complex numbers; solution to cubic equation necessitates complex numbers even in the case that the solutions are real.
- 3D geometry lead to quaternions. Hamilton showed how to use quaternions to describe motion in 3D. Later, Gibbs and others supplanted this formalism with the notation of vectors which we still use to this day.
- quantum mechanics for fields lead to super numbers. Berezin invoked mathematics which demanded the variables anticommute. Such variables can be thought of as taking values in the super numbers.


Gauss proved that imaginary numbers exist in about 1800. Of course, mathematicians had used complex numbers in one way another for about 200 years before Gauss.
