# Integer sequences

## Factorial

n! = n ∙ (n - 1)!

## Fibonacci sequence
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers .

The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1, or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2.

Starting from the nominal beginning, i.e. from 0 and 1, the sequence expands: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …
