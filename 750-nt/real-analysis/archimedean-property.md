# Archimedean property

It may appear that the postulates for an ordered field are an adequate description of the real number system. But this is far from true; the postulates, so far, allow some strange possibilities; namely, there can be an order field that is Euclidean but not Achimedean.

Achimedean property can be described geometrically by considering two line segments: a tiny line segment `ε` and very long `M`. It is reasonable to suppose that if we take enough copies of `ε`, and lay them end to end, we will eventually surpass the length of `M`. And this should be true no matter how long `M` is, and no matter how short `ε` is. If the lengths of the segments are the real numbers `M` and `ε`, and `n` copies of `ε` are enough, then `nε > M`. This is the idea that Archimedes had in mind when he said that if he had a long enough lever and a fulcrum to rest it on, he could move the world.

**The Archimedean property**. Let `M` and `ε` be any two positive real numbers. Then there is a positive integer `n` such that `nε > M`. An ordered field which satisfies this condition is called *Archimedean field*. Henceforth, we shall assume that ℝ forms an *Archimedean ordered field*.
