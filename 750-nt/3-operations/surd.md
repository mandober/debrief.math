# Surd

When we cannot simplify a number any further to remove a root, then we have a surd. For example, `√2` cannot be simplified further, so it is a surd; as is `√3`, `√5`, `∛11`, `⁵√3`. Surds are irrational numbers.

Around 820 CE, Al-Khwarizmi had called the irrational numbers "inaudible", which was later translated to the Latin as `surdus` ("deaf", "mute"). So now surd means a root of a number, that is (overall) an irrational number.

>When it is a root and irrational, it is a surd; but not all roots are surds.

Surds and expressions with roots should be simplified as much as possible; e.g. `√12` is simplified as `√(3×4)`, which is `√4 √3`, which is `2√3`.

- √ab = √a√b
- √(a/b) = √a/√b
