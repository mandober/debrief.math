# Arithmetic operations

Arithmetic operations:
- elementary arithmetic operations: +, -, ×, ÷
- hyperoperations hierarchy: H₀ = S, H₁ = +, H₂ = ×, H₃ = ^, H₄ = ↑², Hₖ = ↑ᵏ

Arithmetic operations can be classified in many ways, according to various criteria (factors and properties), one of which is as *hyperoperations hierarchy*.

In the hyperoperations hierarchy, the most basic operation is the successor, denoted by `S` or `σ`, which is a unary operation meaning `x + 1`, so S 0 = 1.
