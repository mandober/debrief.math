# Percentage

Percents help us understand numbers in comparison to 100, which is useful for real-world applications.

`x% of y` = `x/100 × y`

One percent, 1%, means 1 per 100.
- 200% of 80 is 200/100 × 80 = 160
- 120% of 80 is 120/100 × 80 = 96
- 110% of 80 is 110/100 × 80 = 88
- 100% of 80 is 100/100 × 80 = 80
-  75% of 80 is  75/100 × 80 = 60
-  50% of 80 is  50/100 × 80 = 40
-  25% of 80 is  25/100 × 80 = 20
-  20% of 80 is  20/100 × 80 = 16
-  15% of 80 is  15/100 × 80 = 12
-  10% of 80 is  10/100 × 80 = 8
-   5% of 80 is   5/100 × 80 = 4
-   2% of 80 is   2/100 × 80 = 8/5 = 1.6
-   1% of 80 is   1/100 × 80 = 4/5 = 0.8
-   x% of y  is   x/100 × y

Percent means "per 100", so 75% means 75/100.

A percent can also be expressed as a decimal or fraction:
a half can be written as 50%, 0.5, 1/2

In general, `y` percent of some number `x` is `y% of x`. 
>However, `y% of x` is the same as `x% of y`.

- 8% of 50 = 50% of 8 = 4
- 120% of 58 = 58% of 120
  - 120 / 100 × 58 = 69.6
  - 120 × 58 / 100 = 69.6
  - 58 / 100 × 120 = 69.6
  - 58 × 120 / 100 = 69.6


>x% of y = x/100×y = xy/100 = y% of x = y/100×x = yx/100

x% of y = z
- x / 100 × y = z
- y / 100 × x = z
- xy / 100 = z
- (x / 100) × (y / 100) × 100 = z


23% of 88 = 20.24
- (23 / 100) × 88 = 20.24 (a)
- 88 × (23 / 100) = 20.24 (a)
- (88 / 100) × 23 = 20.24 (b)
- 23 × (88 / 100) = 20.24 (b)
- (23 × 88) / 100 = 2024 / 100 = 20.24 (c)
- (88 × 23) / 100 = 20.24 (c)
- (88 / 100) × (23 / 100) = 0.88 × 0.23 = 0.2024
- (88 / 100) × (23 / 100) = 0.88 × 0.23 = 0.2024, 0.2024 × 100 = 20.24


```
88 / (100 × 23) = 88 / 2300 = 0.03826
23 / (100 × 88) = 23 / 8800 = 0.00261363

88 / 23 = 3.826
23 / 88 = 0.26136
23 × 88 = 2024

20.24 / 88 = 0.23
20.24 / 23 = 0.88
