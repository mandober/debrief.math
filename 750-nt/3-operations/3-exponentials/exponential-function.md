# Exponential function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function

The exponential function is a mathematical function denoted by

`f(x) = exp(x)` or `eˣ`    (where the argument `x` is the exponent)

Unless otherwise specified, the term generally refers to the positive-valued function of a real variable, although it can be extended to the complex numbers or generalized to other mathematical objects like matrices or Lie algebras.

The exponential function originated from the operation of taking powers of a number (repeated multiplication), but various modern definitions allow it to be rigorously extended to all real arguments, including irrational numbers.

Its ubiquitous occurrence in pure and applied mathematics led mathematician Walter Rudin to consider the exponential function to be "the most important function in mathematics"

The functions `f(x) = bˣ` for `b ∈ ℝᐩ` are known as *exponential functions*, and satisfy the *exponentiation identity*, `bˣᐩʸ = bˣbʸ` for all x,y ∈ ℝ.

This implies `bⁿ = b × ⋯ × b` (with `n` factors) for positive integers `n`, where `b = b¹`, relating exponential functions to the elementary notion of exponentiation.

The natural base `e = exp(1) = 2.71828…` is a ubiquitous mathematical constant called *Euler's number*.

To distinguish it, `exp(x) = eˣ` is called the **exponential function** or the natural exponential function: it is the unique real-valued function of a real variable *whose derivative is itself* and whose value at 0 is 1:

>exp′(x) = exp(x) for all x ∈ ℝ, and exp(0) = 1
