# Exponentiation operation

Exponentiation operation is iterated multiplication.


`aⁿ = a × a × ⋯ × a` (n times multiplying a by itself)

```js
a⁰ = 1
a¹ = a
a² = a × a
a³ = a × a × a

x = aⁿ
ⁿ√x = a
n = logₐ x

a⁻¹ = 1/a
a⁻² = 1/a²
a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ

√a = a¹′²
√a² = a²′²
√a³ = a³′²
³√a² = a²′³
ʳ√aⁿ = aⁿ′ʳ
a⁻ⁿ′ʳ = 1/aⁿ
```
