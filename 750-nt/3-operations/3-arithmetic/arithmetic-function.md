# Arithmetic function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_function

An **arithmetic function**, or **number-theoretic function**, is usually understood as a function whose domain is the set of non-negative integers, ℕ or ℤ⃰, and whose range is the (sub)set of the complex numbers, `f : ℤ⃰ → ℂ`.

An example of an arithmetic function is *the divisor function* whose value at a positive integer `n` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`.
