The successor is fundamentally a function that takes an argument and returns its successor, defined by `σ(x) = x + 1`. Besides `σ`, some other names of the successor are `S`, `succ`, `suc`, and others (with various letter cases).

The *type of the successor function* is ℕ → ℕ

cannot be any number set because ℚ and higher sets do not have a notion of successor (what would be the successor of 3/4 or π?). This is because between any two rational number there is always a number. It is the same with higher sets, R, ℂ, and so on.


denoted by `S` or `σ`, which is a unary operation meaning `x + 1`, so S 0 = 1. 

In the hyperoperations hierarchy, the most basic operation is the
