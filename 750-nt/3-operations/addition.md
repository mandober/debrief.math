# Addition 

Addition is an elementary arithemtic operation.

Addition is like an abstract concept - an abstract operation of adding two numbers - and it is then expressed in various ways.

Addition is actually a function (all functions are operations). All operators are really functions with some specific properties and the rules of use (as dictated by grammar).

As a function, addition may be defined by `f(x,y) = x + y`, although we have here a problem of infinite regress since the `+` symbol is undefined. However, this can be resolved by first defining the natural numbers, â„•, using the Peano axioms, then we'd get the successor as well as the addition operation.

```hs
-- A Nat is either zero or a successor of another nat
data Nat = Z | S Nat

-- 1) there exits an object Z (zero) which is a member of set â„•
âˆƒZ âˆˆ â„• -- âˆƒZ(Z âˆˆ â„•)

-- 2) if n is an element of set â„•, then its successor is also a member of â„•
âˆ€n âˆˆ â„•. S n âˆˆ â„•

-- 3) zero is successor of no element
âˆ€n âˆˆ â„•. S n â‰  0

-- 4) successor is injective
âˆ€nm âˆˆ â„•. S n = S m â‡’ n = m

-- 5) induction: if a predicate P holds for Z, and
-- assuming that, if P holds for n then it also holds for n+1,
-- then P holds for all elements of set â„•
(P(Z) âˆ§ âˆ€n(P(S(n)) P(n))) â‡’ âˆ€n.P(n)
```

We then have the *successor function*, `S : â„• â†’ â„•`, it takes any number in â„• and produces its successor:
- S Z = S Z
- S (S Z) = S S Z
- S (S (S Z)) = S S S Z

Practically, whatever argument `S` receives it just slaps another `S` on it. Here, `S` is both function and a tag, i.e. it is a *tagging function*. A tagging function receives an argument and tags it, i.e. leaves it in the form of application, `S Z âŸ¼ S (S Z)`. An expresion of the form like `S Z` cannot be reduced further, just like, e.g. expression `Z` (at least not in this context). So, `S Z` is at the same time an application of the function `S` to an argument (`Z`), but it is also the form of the number one. In this system, the natural numbers are represented in *unary notation*:
- Z
- S Z â‰¡ S(Z) â‰¡ SZ
- S S Z â‰¡ S (S Z) â‰¡ S(S(Z)) â‰¡ SSZ
- S S S Z â‰¡ S (S S Z) â‰¡ S(S(S(Z))) â‰¡ SSSZ

Other unary notation for representing the natural numbers:
- 0: â¨‰ or (nothing), âˆ™
- 1: â”‚, 1
- 2: â”‚â”‚, 11
- 3: â”‚â”‚â”‚, 111
- 4: â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚, 1111
- 5: â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚â”‚ or â”¼â”¼â”¼â”¼, 11111


SSZ + SSSZ = S S Z + S S S Z = S S S S S Z = SSSSSZ


## Plus operator

Addition is a *binary operation* - it takes two arguments and computes their sum. Addition is actually a *function*, albeit with a symbolic name - functions that have symbolic names are called *operators* and they can appear in various positions within the expression.

In math, addition is represented as the plus operator, `+`. The origin of the plus symbol is similar to that of the ampersand symbol, as they both stem from the Latin word "et" (meaning "and"): `et`, `ðŸ™°`, `ðŸ™²`, `ðŸ™µ`, `ðŸ™´`, `&`. The two letters in "et" have fused as this frequent word was often written as a ligature as a mean to shorten it. At a point when it was written as `ðŸ™²`, its evolution has forked with one branch developing into the ampersand sign, and the other into the plus sign.

The plus is an *infix* operator - it is placed between two operands, `a + b`. Besides fixity, operators also have the properties of associativity and commutativity. Plus is left-associative which doesn't mean musch since it is also commutative.



produces the result called *sum*.

`x + y = z`

Addition: binary operation
- term + term = sum
- addend + addend = sum
- summand + summand = sum
- augend + addend = sum

Summation: n-ary addition
- term + term + â€¦ = sum
- summand + summand + â€¦ = sum
