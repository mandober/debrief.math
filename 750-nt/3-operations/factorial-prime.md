# Factorial prime

A *factorial prime* is a number that is prime and one less or one more than a factorial, `±(n!)`.

- n = 1, n! = 1,   FP(1!) = 2
- n = 2, n! = 2,   FP(2!) = 3
- n = 3, n! = 6,   FP(3!) = {5,7}
- n = 4, n! = 24,  FP(4!) = 23
- n = 5, n! = 120, FP(5!) = ∅ (119 and 121 are not primes)
- n = 6, n! = 720, FP(6!) = 719 (721 is not prime)
- n = 7, n! = 5040, FP(7!) = 5039 (5041 is not prime)
