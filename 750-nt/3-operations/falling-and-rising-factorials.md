# Falling and rising factorials

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_and_rising_factorials

- Falling factorial: `(x)ₙ`
- Rising factorial: `x⁽ⁿ⁾`

*Falling factorial* (descending factorial, falling sequential product, lower factorial) is defined as the polynomial



When `x` is a positive integer, `(x)ₙ` gives the number of `n`-permutations (sequences of distinct elements) from an `x`-element set, or equivalently the *number of injective functions* from a set of size `n` to a set of size `x`.

Rising factorial `x⁽ⁿ⁾` gives the number of partitions of an `n`-element set into `x` ordered sequences (possibly empty).
