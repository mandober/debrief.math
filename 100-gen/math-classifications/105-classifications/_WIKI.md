"If there be mathematicians to whom 
these definitions and discussions 
seem to be an elaboration 
and complication of the simple, 
it may be well to remind them 
that here, as elsewhere, 
apparent simplicity 
may conceal a complexity 
which is the business of somebody, 
whether philosopher or mathematician, 
to unravel".
