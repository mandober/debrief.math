# Discrete Mathematics

Discrete Mathematics studies discrete, separate and enumerable mathematical objects and structures.

Since computers operate on discrete bits of data, Discrete Mathematics overlaps with Computer Science in its study of:
- algorithms
- algorithmic complexity
- proofs
- formal language
- automata
- computability
- correctness of programming languages
- automated and assisted theorem proving

Solving a problem computationally requires
- modeling the world
- devising an algorithm
- determining its efficiency and correctness
