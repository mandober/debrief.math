# Pre-intuitionism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-intuitionism

In the philosophy of mathematics, the pre-intuitionists were a small but influential group who informally shared similar philosophies on the nature of mathematics.

The term itself was used by *L. E. J. Brouwer*, who in his 1951 lectures at Cambridge described the *differences between intuitionism and its predecessors*:

Of a totally different orientation 
[from "Old Formalist School" of Dedekind, Cantor, Peano, Zermelo, Couturat, …] 
was the *Pre-Intuitionist School*, 
mainly led by *Poincaré, Borel and Lebesgue*. 

These thinkers seem to have maintained 
a modified observational standpoint 
for the introduction of natural numbers, 
for the principle of complete induction […].

For these, even for such theorems 
as were deduced by means of classical logic, 
they postulated an existence and exactness 
independent of language and logic and 
regarded its non-contradictority as certain, 
even without logical proof. 

For the continuum, however, 
they seem not to have sought an origin 
strictly extraneous to language and logic.
