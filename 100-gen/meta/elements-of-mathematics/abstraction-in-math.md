## Abstraction in mathematics

## Abstraction

The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:
1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.
2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 
3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.
-- John Locke, *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1690)


## Abstraction in general

The concept of abstraction in general.



## Abstraction

More generally, **abstraction** is the process in which, the previously studied and well-understood details of the studied subject, are undergoing the deliberate simplification as the process of understanding moves from the lower to the higher details, i.e. from particularity toward totality.

## Abstract and concrete

* In metaphysics, *abstract* and *concrete* are classifications that denote whether the object that a term (reference) describes has physical *referents*.

```
denote, denotation, denotational
term, terminology
reference, referee, referent, referral, referential
```

* *Abstract objects* have no physical existence, whereas *concrete objects* do.

* Abstract objects are most commonly used in philosophy and semantics.

* Abstract objects are sometimes called `abstracta` (sing. abstractum) and concrete objects are sometimes called `concreta` (sing. concretum).

* There's no consensus on the characteristics of concreteness and abstractness; one possible approach, is to define the distinction, in terms of the difference, between
1. existence inside or outside space-time
2. whether they have causes and effects or not
3. having contingent or necessary existence

* It is often held that an *abstract object* is an object that does not exist at any particular time or place, but rather exists as a type of thing, as an (abstract, generalization) idea.

* The study of abstract objects is called *abstract object theory (AOT)*. According to AOT, some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) exemplify properties, while others (abstract objects like numbers, and what others would call "non-existent objects", like the round square, and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely encode them (this is also known as the dual copula strategy).

**Abstraction in mathematics** is the process of extracting the underlying structure and patterns from a *mathematical object (object or concept)*. By extracting its essential properties, we are also removing any dependencies it might had with other objects, thereby obtaining a more general version of that object; a version that will, presumably, have a wider range of application, and allow us to make comparisions between many abstractions.

By generalizing the mathematical objects, we can apply the

The process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns, or properties of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects.

These include, for example:
- Finding the shared properties of similar polynomials
- Formalizing the general pattern of a sequence
- Establishing a one-to-one correspondence between two sets
- Constructing an alternate axiomatic system for Euclidean geometry

At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a broaden applicability to a field - along with some unification in between the fields.


In math, **abstraction** is the process of extracting the underlying *essence* of a *mathematical concept* (by removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected) and *generalizing* it so that it has wider applications among other abstract descriptions and phenomena.

> In philosophy, **essence** is the property that makes an entity what it fundamentally is, which it has by necessity, without which it loses its identity. Essence is contrasted with **accident** - a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity.


Major abstractions:
- Zero
- Hindu-Arabic numerals
- Positional numeral system
- Arithmetic operations: 1 + 3 - 2 ⨯ 4 ÷ 2
- Basic algebra has abstracted numbers: a + b - c ⨯ d ÷ c
- Abstract algebra has abstracted operations: a 🚌 b 🚏 c 🐀 d 👜 c
- Functions


sets -> structures -> groups, filed, ring -> categories
