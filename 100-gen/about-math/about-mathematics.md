# About mathematics

Mathematics. Oh, how sweet the sound. Privileged people will be the first to lauch into a romantic tyrade about how pure and independent math is, how numbers never lie, how math doesn't care if you're rich or poor, black or white, man or woman, no; it only cares about whether you can do the work and do it correctly… What a bunch of bollocks!

Mathematics is the world's oldest boy's club. Membership requires mysogeny, racism, doublethink, doublespeak, patronizing, brown-nosing, gas-lighting, and enourmous amounts of hypocrisy.

Mostly old, permanently white, constantly men - otherwise known as "mathematicins", have long ago establish a hierachy of interest groups, lobbyist and influencers 🤓👺🧐👹👿👽🤠, forming a clan impenetrable by modest enthusiast. Your theory may brew free coffee, it won't be ackowedged, it won't be read - no peer review for you! 🥺 If you insist, you will be ridiculed by the mathematical mainstream, the nastiest, bitchiest clique there ever was. In conclusion: mathematics good, mathematicians bad. And it takes far more than honest work to make it.
