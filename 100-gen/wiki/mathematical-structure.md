# Mathematical structure

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure

A **mathematical structure** is a set, in this context called a **carrier set**, endowed with one or more **features**. Often, these features are attached or related to the carrier set, so as to provide it with something extra (additional meaning, significance, properties, features, structure).

As an example, a *partially-ordered set*, aka poset, is a set with a partial ordering relation attached. Another example is a semigroup - a mathematical structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation closed over the carrier set.

*Features* include
- operation
- relation
- metric
- structure
- topology

What is called here a "feature" often takes the form of a (binary) *operation*, or at least it could be expressed as one. For example, relations in particular, can be expressed as operations.

However, as the name "mathematical structure" suggest, the focus is primarily set on the emerging structure. That is, there is a carrier set, which is a kind of structure itself, then, there are "features" attached to the set, which themselves are also structures, and then, there is the overall structure or the emerging structure, which is usually what is meant when we say that, e.g. some maps preserve the underlying structure.

Many mathematical structures, especially algebraic structures, may have one or more (binary) operations attached, i.e. multiple features of the same kind (e.g. two operations), and some structures have multiple features of different kinds (e.g. an operation and a relation).

Sets endowed with multiple features simultaneously allow mathematicians to study the interaction between the different mathematical structures in a richer setting.

For example, an ordering imposes a rigid form, shape, or topology on a set, and if a set has both a *topology feature* and a *group feature*, such that these two features are related in a certain way, then the structure becomes a *topological group*.

>A mathematical structure is more abstract than a mathematical object. Many different objects may implement the same structure.

Mathematical structure
- (broader notion than algebraic structure)
- carrier set
- features
- possibly some axioms

Algebraic structure
- (narrower notion than mathematical structure)
- carrier set
- usually features are one or more binary operations
- a set of axioms

In abstract algebra especially, a mathematical structure is called an **algebraic structure** or an **algebra**, and its definition, besides a set and extra features attached to it, also includes a set of axioms that the carrier set and the features together must satisfy.

*Mathematical structures* include
- measures
- algebraic structures (group, ring, module, lattice, vector space, etc.)
- topologies
- metric structures (geometries like Euclidean space)
- orders (partial, total, strict, quasi, preorder, well-order, etc.)
- graphs
- events
- equivalence relations
- differential structures
- categories


**Mappings** between mathematical structures that preserve the underlying structure are of special interest in many fields of mathematics.

A structure-preserving mapping is one that maps one mathematical structures into another such that a structure in the source (domain) object is mapped to an equivalent structure in the target (codomain) object.

Such mappings appear in many areas of math and they include
- *homomorphisms* that preserve algebraic structures
- *homeomorphisms* that preserve topological structures
- *diffeomorphisms* that preserve differential structures
- *functors* that preserve categorical structures

*Morphisms* in general are the structure-preserving mappings.

## History

In 1939, the French group "Nicolas Bourbaki" saw structures as the root of mathematics. They first mentioned them in their "Fascicule" of Theory of Sets and expanded it into Chapter IV of the 1957 edition.

They have identified 3 "mother" structures:
- algebraic structures
- topological structures
- ordering structures

## Example: The set of the real numbers

The set of the real numbers, ℝ, has several standard structures:
- *order*: each number is either less than or greater than any other number.
- *algebraic structure*: there are operations (+) and (×) such that (ℝ,+,0,-◌) and (ℝ,×,1,◌⁻¹) are groups, and their pair is a field, (ℝ,+,0,-◌,×,1,◌⁻¹).
- *measure*: intervals of the real line have a specific length, which can be extended to the Lebesgue measure on many of its subsets.
- *metric*: there is a notion of distance between points.
- *geometry*: ℝ is equipped with a metric and it is flat.
- *topology*: there is a notion of open sets.

**Interfaces** exist among these:
- its order and, independently, its metric structure, induce its *topology*
- its order and algebraic structure make it an *ordered field*
- its algebraic structure and topology make it a *Lie group* (a type of topological group)
