# Probability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability

Probability is the likelihood of an event ocurring expressed numerically.

("likelihood" - the state of being probable; probability; something probable)

Probability is concerned with the numerical description of the likelihood of an event occurring; or, more generally, the likelihood that a proposition is true.

That numerical description is usually expressed as a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive, with 0 denoting the impossibility of an event ocurring, and 1 denoting certainty that it will. The higher this number is (the chance or the probability), the more likely it is that the event will occur.

A simple example is the flip of a coin where the two outcomes are both equally probable, each having the chance of 0.5 to occur. The probability that either 'heads' or 'tails' occurs is 1 (under normal circumstances, eg. the coin cannot land on a side, or vanish into the thin air and such phenomena). The chance of 'heads' is 0.5 (as is the chance of 'tails'). The probability that 'heads' will occur both times in two (consequitive) coin tosses is 0.5 ⨯ 0.5 = 0.25 = 1/2². The probability of 6 'heads' in a row is 1/2⁶.
