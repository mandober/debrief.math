## Abel Prize
Abel Prize is an award granted annually for research in mathematics in commemoration of the XIX century Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. The "Niels Henrik Abel Memorial Fund" was established in 2002, and it is administered by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process by which an object is stripped of all irrelevant details in order to expose its underlying structure. Abstraction is reached by extracting the common features from a set of related examples. Abstraction is the process in which the details of a well-understood object are deliberately "forgotten" in order to simplify it and then regard it as a new entity independent of its parts.

## Algebra
1. Algebra, branch of mathematics in which arithmetical operations and formal manipulations are applied to abstract symbols rather than specific numbers.
2. An algebra or an algebraic structure is a mathematical structure consisting of a carrier set endowed with additional structure and a set of axioms.


## Algorithm
Algorithm is a systematic procedure that produces in a finite number of steps a solution to a query/problem.

The name derives from the Latin translation ("Algoritmi de numero Indorum") of the IX century treatise on arithmetic by the mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (Al-Khwarizmi ~> Al-gwaritmi ~> Al-goritmi ~> Al-go-rithm). (rithm vs rhythm)

Many mathematical terms beginning with "al-" have arabic origin   
al-gebra, al-cohol, al-caloid, Al-geebra, Al-gezira, Al-Khwarizmi, 
al-fred, offred, oftalmolog

## Analysis
Mathematical Analysis, as a branch of mathematics, deals with continuous change and with general types of processes emerged from it, such as limits, differentiation and integration.

## Axiom
An *axiom* or a *postulate* is a statement, taken to be true, that serves as an initial premise (a starting point) for further reasoning and argumentation.

In classical logic, an axiom is a self-evident and well-established fact that needs no further proof (lest fall into an infinitely descending spiral of definitions, aka vicious circle). The problem with this view is that is was extremelly hard - as in the ancient times as it is today, when the mathematical reasearch goes beyond simple abstractions - for people to agree what is and what is not "evidently" true.

In modern logic, and more generally in mathematics, an axiom is now understood as any arbitrary statement whatsoever (the set of which still serves as the starting point for reasoning and argumentation). Crucially, an axiom need not be justified! It needs no appeal to intuition; it need not be a self-evident or any other matter of a fact. Instead, the set of axioms is merely specified, but *should one accept it, one is guaranteed that the theory that follows holds true*.

The modern take on axioms is more efficient as the entire issue - of whether a particular axiom is evidently or otherwise true - is sidestepped. Intead of waiting for the jury to come in with a decision, authors can proceed developing their theories.


## Canonical
The term "canonical" refers to a single form, agreed to be the default one, selected from the many equivalent forms that the concept takes. The canonical form is selected as the standard presentation of some mathematical object. This convention allows for unique identification of mathematical objects.

For example, there are many equivalent forms for the fractional representation of the decimal value `0.6̅` (e.g. 2/3, 4/6, 6/9, 46/69), but the form `2/3` is considered as the canonical (i.e. the form in which nominator and denominator are coprime integers).

## Definition
A definition is a statement that attaches a meaning to a term (or a phrase).

The term being defined is called a *definiendum*, while the statement that defines theterm is called a *definiens*. A pair of definiendum and definiens is called a definition. *Intensional definitions* try to give the sense of a term (functions are intensionally equal if their definitions are; functions are extensionally equal if they return the same output for every same input). *Extensional definitions* try to list the objects that a term describes (e.g. set equality is extensional: two sets are equal if they have the same elements). *Ostensive definitions* convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples.

## Enumeration
An enumeration is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection.

## Expression
An expression, in the context of a formal language, is an arbitrary string of symbols that is syntactically well-formed and valid under the grammatical rules of the language.

For example, in lambda calculus, any arbitrary statement is an expression, but also a term.

More generally, a *term* is usually only one particular form, belonging to a small set of initial or elementary forms, which are used to define a formal language. On the other hand, an expression is any arbitrary statement in that language.

These notions are rarely used very strictly - very often the terms expression, statement, sentence, formula are used interchangibly.

## Extensionality
Extensionality refers to principles that judge objects to be equal if they have the same external properties, as opposed to *intensionality*, which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same. There are many predicates that are intensionaly different but extensionally identical. For example, the expressions, 2+4 and 2*3, are extensionally equal (from outside), but intensionality different (from within).

## Extremal clause
The clause in a recursive definition that specifies that no items other than those generated by the stated rules fall within the definition; e.g. 0 is an natural number; if n is a natural number then S(n) is a natural number, "and nothing else is a natural number".

## First-order logic
First-order logic (FOL), "first-order" means that variables range only over the individuals that comprise the doamin of discorse (individuals make the first order or sort). In SOL, vars range over properties as well.

While propositional logic deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers predicates and quantification. Predicate logic uses quantified variables over objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so rather than propositions such as "Socrates is a man" one can have expressions in the form "there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man" and "there exists" is a quantifier while "X" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets.

## Formal theory
A formal theory is a collection of sentences in a formal language (usually FOL) expressing statements about a mathematical structure.

## Formal logic
Formal logic is the study of inference with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule i.e. a rule that is not about any particular thing or property.

## Generalization
Generalization is the formulation of general concepts from specific instances by abstracting common properties. Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences. The process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation.

Generalization is the process (or act) of generalizing, which is the process of deriving or inducing a broad principle (conception, summary) from particulars (details).

(generalizability, generalizable, generalizer)

## Magnitude
In mathematics, magnitude is the size of a mathematical object, a property which determines whether the object is larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind. More formally, an object's magnitude is the displayed result of an ordering (or ranking) of the class of objects to which it belongs.

## Mathematical logic
Mathematical logic is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of model theory, proof theory, set theory, and computability (recursion) theory.

## Mathematical notation
Mathematical notation is a system of symbolic representations of mathematical objects and ideas. Mathematical notations are used in mathematics, the physical sciences, engineering, and economics. Mathematical notations include relatively simple symbolic representations, such as the numbers 0, 1 and 2; function symbols such as sin; operator symbols such as "+"; conceptual symbols such as lim and dy/dx; equations and variables; and complex diagrammatic notations such as Penrose graphical notation and Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams.

## Mathematical object
An abstract object that can be formally defined, and which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs with.

## Model
A model of a formal theory are those structures in which the statements of the theory hold.

## Naïve theory
A naïve or intuitive or unformalized theory is an informal approach to an investigation of some subject that doesn't specify the axioms, but only pokes at the subject with a stick in the dark to see what happens. It's a "come what may" preliminary exploration that relies on intuition.

In an older (now deprecated) sense, a naive theory is actually a fully axiomatized theory where only the presentation is informal, done using an informal, usually natural, language. A prime example of this use is the book "Naive set theory" by Halmos in which he presents ZFC set theory (which is, of course, fully axiomatized) using an informal language.

## Number
- A number is an abstract manner of representing some quantity. 
- A number is an abstract mathematical object. 
- A number is a name given to a measure that describes some magnitude (size). 
- A number is a Platonic form render manifest as numeral(s).
- A numeral is a sequence of digits.
- A numeral (as a series of digits) is an instance of a number.
- A digit is one of 10 symbols used to express numerals (0-9).

## Object language
A language undergoing definition is called an object language, while the language we use to discuss it is called a meta language.

## Predicate
A predicate takes an entity or entities in the domain of discourse as input while outputs are either True or False. Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables. For example, predicates can be used in set builder notation to indicate set membership: a predicate P(x) will be true or false, depending on whether x belongs to a set.

## Primitive notion
In mathematics, a primitive notion is an undefined concept, not defined in terms of previously defined concepts, to be taken for granted. It lacks a proof, and in that regard it's analogous to an axiom of a formal system (axioms don't require proof). Sometimes the primitive notions cannot be avoided because we need to start somewhere lest regress into downward spiral of definitions, forever defining concept in terms of previously defined concept, which also need definition in terms of previous ones, and so on, ad nauseum. Sometimes a concept just doesn't have a formal definition (e.g. "set").

## Propositions
Propositions are declarative sentences that have a truth value; that is, sentences whose truth value we may argue about, and eventually conclude they are true or false.

More strictly, a proposition is an abstract object of logic which may be manifested by different declarative sentences (statements, claims) in a natural language.

Propositions are the main object of study of propositional logic, where a proposition `P` represents an entire declarative sentence, and the main interest is in the way propositions are combined using various logical connectives.

Propositions are also a main object of study of syllogistic logic since a syllogism is a triplet of propositions: two premises and a conclusion. Nevertheless, syllogistic logic is more interested in deduction, in validity and soundness, i.e. whether a conclusion necessarily follows from the premises; and in the relation between a part and the whole, which yields a number of valid syllogisms, all of which have been enumarated long ago.

## Rules of inference
A rule of inference is a rule justifying a logical step from hypothesis to conclusion in logical deduction.

Rules of inference are usually pairs of opposing rules: one (or more) to introduce a logical symbol (connective) and one (or more) to eliminate it.

Rules of inference include conjunction introduction, `∧I`, conjunction elimination, `∧E₁` and `∧E₂`, universal instantiation (UG). Modus ponens (implication elimination) is probably the most well-known rule of inference.

Rules of inference are a part of the broader category of *transformation rules*, which also includes *rules of replacement* comprised of substitutions by identity, De Morgan's laws, transposition, material implication, exportation, tautology, etc.

## Supertask
A procedure that requires carrying out an infinite number of actions (tasks) in a finite amount of time.

## Trinitarianism
Trinitarianism is another name for the correspondence between logic, type theory and category theory, otherwise known as the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism.

## Truth value
Truth value, or logical value, is a value indicating the relation of a proposition and the "general, objective" truth.

A proposition is a statement that has a truth value - it can be evaluated to be true or false.

A proposition is true if what it claims or represents is aligned (compatible) with the objective reality.

## Value
A value is an expression of a formal language that cannot be reduced further. However, programming languages, which are also formal languages, have forms that cannot be further reduced yet they don't represent values (but errors, run-time errors, diverging computation).

Reduction and evaluation are the same process of simplifying (reducing) an expession using appropriate substitutions. The difference between them is that unlike reduction, evaluation produces something that is considered a value in the underlying language.

The result of evaluation is a value. 
The result of reduction is an expression. 

In CS, in many programming languages, values are constants, like a Boolean value 'true' or 'false', or a natural number like 0, 1, 2, etc. Usually they have a literal form.

Some languages may have a more complicated notion of value, as they may include representations of run-time errors as values. Run-time errors are forms that cannot be reduced further - however, they are not values but *special forms*.

It is also possible that a language contains forms which are neither values, nor errors, but which nevertheless cannot be reduced further - these are called *diverging expressions*.

Some languages may equate diverging forms with run-time errors and and other failure conditions, bundling them all under a single value (and type) called *bottom*.

## Well-defined
The adjective "well-defined" has as many meanings as there are nouns it complements. Some of them are: well-defined recursion, well-defined expression, well-defined function, well-defined relation, well-formed formula.

Most often, well-formed means that an entity (expression, formula) is assembled according to the official rules (it is legal or valid), while *well-defined* may also include other feautures besides well-formedness, like being uniquely identifiable, being in some way "smaller" than its previous instance (re an argument in recursion).

## Well-defined expression
A *well-defined expression* is an expression whose definition assigns the unique interpretation (or value) to it. Otherwise, it is an *ambiguous expression* - it can be resolved in more than one way.
