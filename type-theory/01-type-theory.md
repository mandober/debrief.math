# Type Theory: Intro

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory

A type theory is a class of formal systems, where every *term* has a *type* and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type.

Type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics and rewrite systems.

Type theory is closely related to (and overlaps with) *type systems*, which are a programming language feature used to reduce bugs.

Two well-known type theories that can serve as mathematical foundations are Alonzo Church's *typed λ-calculus* and Per Martin-Löf's *intuitionistic type theory*.
