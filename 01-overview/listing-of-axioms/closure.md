# Closure

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(mathematics)

The axiom of **closure** or **totality** is a property of a operation over a mathematical structure, for example over a set; more precisely, it is a property of the structure and operation co-system


a mathematical structure, e.g. a set, together with an operation over that set


A set is closed under an operation if performance of that operation on members of the set always produces a member of that set.



If combining any two elements of the set gives an element that is also a member of that set, we say that the binary operation ("star", `*`) closes over the set.

$$(\forall x,y \in A) \to (x \star y \in A)$$

A binary operation, `*`, that combines any two elements of the set `A` must give a result that is also in `A`.

For example, addition is closed over the natural numbers, but division is not.





The closure is increasing or extensive: the closure of an object contains the object.
The closure is idempotent: the closure of the closure equals the closure.
The closure is monotone, that is, if X is contained in Y, then also C(X) is contained in C(Y).
