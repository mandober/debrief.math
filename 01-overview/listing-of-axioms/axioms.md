# Axioms

The list of laws, axioms and algebraic properties.

Each algebraic structure is defined by the set of axioms that must be upheld. That is, whenever the attached operation operates on the elements of the underlying set, the prescribed axioms must hold.

Axioms:

* Algebras
- totality (closure)
- identity
  - left identity
  - right identity
  - total identity
  - identity element, neutral element
- associativity
- invertibility (inverse)
  - inverse element
- commutativity
- distributivity
  - left distributivity
  - right distributivity
  - total distributivity

* Boolean algebra
  - complement

* Logic
  - excluded middle
  - domination
  - De Morgan's laws (distributivity)

* Sets
  - De Morgan's laws (distributivity)

* Relations
  - reflexivity
    - reflexivity
    - anti-reflexivity
    - irreflexivity

    - asymmetry
    - non-symmetry
  - transitivity
    - transitivity
    - intransitivity
    - anti-transitivity
    - non-transitivity
  - totality
  - trichotomy
