# Complement laws

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)

Complement laws:

$$
{\displaystyle A\cup A^{c}=U} \\
{\displaystyle A\cap A^{c}=\varnothing} \\
{\displaystyle \varnothing ^{c}=U} \\
{\displaystyle U^{c}=\varnothing} \\
{\displaystyle {\text{If }}A\subseteq B{\text{, then }}B^{c}\subseteq A^{c}}
$$

The last one follows from the equivalence of a conditional with its contrapositive.

- guideline: the smaller the set the bigger its complement
- complement of the empty set is the universal set
