# Stability or Stable theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_theory

In model theory, a **stable theory** is one that satisfies certain combinatorial restrictions on its complexity.

Stable theories are rooted in the proof of *Morley's categoricity theorem* and were extensively studied as part of Saharon Shelah's *classification theory*, which showed a dichotomy that either the models of a theory admit a nice classification, or the models are too numerous to have any hope of a reasonable classification. A first step of this program was showing that if a theory is not stable then its models are too numerous to classify.

Stable theories were the predominant subject of *pure model theory* from the 1970s through the 1990s, so their study shaped modern model theory and there is a rich framework and set of tools to analyze them. 

A major direction in model theory is *neostability theory*, which tries to generalize the concepts of stability theory to broader contexts, such as *simple theory* and *NIP theory*.
