# Model theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory

In mathematical logic, **model theory** is the study of the relationship between formal theories and their models.

A *formal theory* is a collection of sentences in a formal language expressing statements about a mathematical structure

A *model of a formal theory* are those structures in which the statements of the theory hold.

Model theory investigates aspects that include the number and size of models of a theory, the relationship of different models to each other, and their interaction with the formal language itself.

Model theory particularly studies the sets that can be defined in a model of a theory, and the relationship of such definable sets to each other.


As a separate discipline, model theory goes back to Alfred Tarski, who first used the term "Theory of Models" in publication in 1954. Since the 1970s, the subject has been shaped decisively by Saharon Shelah's *stability theory*.


Compared to other areas of mathematical logic such as proof theory, model theory is often less concerned with formal rigour and closer in spirit to classical mathematics. This has prompted the comment that "if proof theory is about the sacred, then model theory is about the profane".

The applications of model theory to algebraic and Diophantine geometry reflect this proximity to classical mathematics, as they often involve an integration of algebraic and model-theoretic results and techniques. Consequently, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.

The most prominent scholarly organization in the field of model theory is the Association for Symbolic Logic.
