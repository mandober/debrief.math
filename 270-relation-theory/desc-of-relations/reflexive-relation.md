## Reflexive relation

In mathematics, 
a binary relation R 
on a set X 
is reflexive 
if it relates every element of X to itself.

Formally, this may be written 
∀x ∈ X . (x, x) ∈ R, 
or as I ⊆ R 
where I is the identity relation on X.












> A binary relation R on set S is **reflexive** if every element of S is related to itself, xRx or R(x,x).

R on S is reflexive if `∀a. a ∈ S -> (a,a) ∈ R`

A relation $$R$$ on the set $$\mathbb{N^+}$$ is reflexive if it contains __all diagonal (or identity) pairs__ e.g. $$R=\{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),\dots\}$$.

A graph that represents a reflexive relation is the one where each vertex has an identity arrow.


## Irreflexive relation

> A binary relation R on set S is **irreflexive** (anti-reflexive) if no element of S is related to itself, ¬R(x,x), x is not R-related to x.

Rel R on a set S is irreflexive if `∀a. a ∈ S -> (a,a) ∉ R`

A relation $$R$$ on the set $$\mathbb{N^+}$$ is irreflexive if it contains no diagonal (or identity) pairs.
