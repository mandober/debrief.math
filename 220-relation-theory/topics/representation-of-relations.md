## Representation of relations



## With graphs

A relation can be represented using a directed graph. The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the number of elements in the set from which the relation has been defined. For each ordered pair `(x,y)` in the relation `R`, there will be a directed edge from the vertex `x` to the vertex `y`. If there is an ordered pair `(x,x)`, there will be self-loop on the vertex `x`.

If R = {(1,1),(1,2),(3,2)} is a relation on the set S = {1,2,3}, it can be represented by the graph...
