# Serial relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_relation

A **serial relation** or **left-total relation** is a binary relation R for which every element of the domain has a corresponding range element, `∀x∃y.xRy`. That is, each and every element of the domain set is associated with some element of the codomain.

Examples:
* a function is serial on its domain
* LE relation (<=) on ℕ is serial:


* a reflexive relation is a serial relation but the converse is not true
* a serial + symmetric and transitive is reflexive (equivalence relation)
* if a strict order is serial, then it has no maximal element.

* In Euclidean and affine geometry, the serial property of the relation of parallel lines, `m ∥ n`, is expressed by *Playfair's axiom*.

* In Principia Mathematica, Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead refer to "relations which generate a series" as serial relations; their notion differs from the usual in that a relation may have a finite range.

* For a relation `R = {y: xRy }` denote the "successor neighborhood" of `x`. A serial relation can be equivalently characterized as every element having a non-empty successor neighborhood. Similarly an *inverse serial relation* is a relation in which every element has non-empty "predecessor neighborhood". More commonly, an inverse serial relation is called a surjective relation, and is specified by a serial converse relation.

* In normal modal logic, the extension of fundamental *axiom set K* by the *serial property* results in *axiom set D*.
