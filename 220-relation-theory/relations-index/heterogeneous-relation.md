# Heterogeneous relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_relation

* A **heterogeneous relation** is a relation between distinct sets, `R ⊆ A⨯B` and `A ≠ B`.
* The prefix "hetero" is from `ἕτερος` /heteros/ "other, another, different".
* A heterogeneous relation has been called a *rectangular relation*, suggesting that it does not have the square-symmetry of a homogeneous relation on a set when A = B.




Developments in algebraic logic have facilitated usage of binary relations. The calculus of relations includes the algebra of sets, extended by composition of relations and the use of converse relations. The inclusion `R ⊆ S`, meaning that `aRb -> aSb`, sets the scene in a lattice of relations. 

R ⊆ S. aRb -> aSb


In contrast to homogeneous relations, the composition of relations operation is only a partial function. The necessity of matching range to domain of composed relations has led to the suggestion that the study of heterogeneous relations is a chapter of category theory as in the category of sets, except that the morphisms of this category are relations. The objects of the category Rel are sets, and the relation-morphisms compose as required in a category.
