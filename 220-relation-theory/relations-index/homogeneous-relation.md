# Homogeneous relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_relation

A **homogeneous relation** or **endorelation** on a set `X` is a binary relation over the set `X` and itself, i.e. it is a subset of the Cartesian product `X ⨯ X = X²`, so, `R ⊆ X ⨯ X`.

An example of a homogeneous relation is the relation of kinship, where the relation is over people.

A homogeneous relation R over a set X may be identified with a directed simple graph permitting loops, or if it is symmetric, with an undirected simple graph permitting loops, where X is the vertex set and R is the edge set (there is an edge from a vertex x to a vertex y if and only if xRy). It is called the adjacency relation of the graph.
