# Index of all relation types

Division of mathematical relations according to their different properties


Relations: division based on general properties
- Finiteness of sets
  - finitary relation
  - infinitary relation
- Geneity of sets
  - homogeneous relation: between entities of the same type
  - heterogeneous relation: between different type of entities
- Arity of relation
  - nullary: makes no sense as a relation
  - unary  : is more of a property then relation
  - binary : usual relation between 2 sets (even if they are the same set)
  - ternary: relation between 3 sets (rare)
  - arity > 2 are generalizations, they are rels on/between indexed sets
- Cardinality of relation
  - null (empty) relation
  - full (total) relation


Relations: division based on axioms

* Reflexivity
  -       reflexive relation
  -     irreflexive relation
  -     coreflexive relation
  - quasi-reflexive relation
  * *negated* (¬)
    - non-reflexive relation
    - non-irreflexive relation

* Symmetry
  -     symmetric relation
  -    asymmetric relation
  - antisymmetric relation
  * *negated* (¬)
    -     non-symmetric relation
    -    non-asymmetric relation
    - non-antisymmetric relation

- Transitivity
  - transitive relation
  * *negated* (¬)
    - intransitive  relation
    - non-transitive




- reflexive: `Sy+Tr+Serial`
- equivalence, `EQ` = `Re+Sy+Tr`
- partial equivalence, `pEQ`: `Sy+Tr`
- partial order: `pOrd` = `Re+vS+Tr`
- linear (total) order: partial order that is total, `Re+vS+Tr+`
- linear (total) order: partial order that is total, `Re+vS+Tr+Total`
- well-order: linear order where every non-empty subset has a least element.

- The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment.
