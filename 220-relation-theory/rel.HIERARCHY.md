# Relation theory: Hierarchy

* Preliminaries
  - sets
  - ordered pair
  - Cartesian product
  - set of ordered pairs

* General notions
  - notion of a relation
  - associations of elements
  - relation as a triplet (A, B, R)
  - notation
  * In terms of the type of the sets
    - heterogeneous relations
      - Relation between distinct sets
    - homogeneous relation
      - Relation on the same set
  * In term of set cardinality
    - finitary relation
    - infinitary relation
  * Arity of relations
    - unary relation, property
    - binary relation, predicate
    - ternary relation
    - k-ary (with some fixed k)
    - n-ary (with an arbitrary n)

* Representing relations
  - table
  - diagramm
  - matrix of rows тип cols indexed by elements
  - logical matrix, 1 if (row, col) elements are related; else 0
  - directed or undirected graph
  - coordinate system: each ord pair (x,y) is a point

* Operations of relations
  * Set operations
    - union
    - intersection
    - difference
    - complementation
  * Rel operations
    - converse
    - composition
    - transpose

* Extreme relations
  - null (empty) relation
  - universal (total) relation

* Special relations
  - identity relation

* Reflexivity
  * (positive)
    - reflexive relation
    - irreflexive relation (antireflexive, aliorelative)
    - coreflexive relation
    - quasi-reflexivity
      - quasireflexive relation
      - left quasi-reflexivity
      - right quasi-reflexivity
    - coreflexive
  * (negative)
    - non-reflexive relation
    - non-irreflexive relation



* Closures
  - Reflexive closure
  - Symmetric closure
  - Transitive closure
  - Binary relation closures
  - P closures of binary relations
