## Binary relation
A binary relation associates elements of the domain set, `X`, with elements of the codomain setm `Y`. A binary relation over sets `X` and `Y` is a set of ordered pairs `(x,y)` where `x` elements come from the domain and `y` elements from the codomain. Relations, particularly a binary relation, may be considered as a generalization of a mathematical function, but with fewer restrictions, since every function is a relation (but not vice versa).

## n-ary relation
An n-ary relation `R` over `n` sets `X‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, X‚Çô` is a subset of their Cartesian product `R ‚äÜ X‚ÇÅ ‚®Ø ‚Ä¶ ‚®Ø X‚Çô`. A binary (2-ary) relation is the most studied case (for n = 2) of n-ary relations.

## Endorelation
A synonym for a homogeneous relation.

## Homogeneous relation
A homogeneous relation is a relation on the same set, `R ‚äÜ A‚®ØB` and `A = B`.

## Heterogeneous relation
A heterogeneous relation is a relation between two distinct sets, `R ‚äÜ A‚®ØB` and `A ‚â† B`.

## Reflexive relation
A homogeneous binary relation `R` on a set `X` is reflexive if it relates every element of `X` to itself, `‚àÄx ‚àà X. xRx`. An example of a reflexive relation is EQ (=) on the set of (real) numbers, since every (real) number is equal to itself. A reflexive relation is said to have the reflexive property or is said to possess reflexivity.

## Equivalence relation
Equivalence relation is actually defined by simultaneous presence of 3 properties (or relations): reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.

## Irreflexive relation
An irreflexive relation R on a set A, `‚àÄa ‚àà A. (a,a) ‚àâ R`.

## Inclusion relation
The relation of one set being a subset of another is an inclusion relation, or a containment relation.

## Many-to-one relation
Functional and not injective.

## Many-to-many relation
Not injective nor functional.

## One-to-one relation
Injective and functional relation.

## One-to-many relation
Injective and not functional.

## Relation
Relations encode a common concept of associations between objects, with binary relations as the most common and natural case: the fact that an object `x` is related to an object `y` is denoted by the ordered pair `(x,y)`. Relations have directionality which the ordered pair preserves, with the the intended iterpretation that `x` is related to `y`. Since these objects are normally elements in sets, the notion of relation is lifted from object to set elements and therefore to sets, so we consider relations on (or between) sets. A relation `R` between sets `X` and `Y` is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product, `R ‚äÜ X ‚®Ø Y`; futhermore, an element `x` of `X` is related to an element `y` of `Y` iff the pair `(x,y)` belongs to the set of ordered pairs that makes the relation, `(x,y) ‚àà R` or `xRy` for short. This introduces an issue regarding the full specification of a relation: specifying just the actual set of ordered pairs is not enough - we need to specify both sets as well. Therefore, more strictly, a relation is a triplet __`ùì° = (A, B, R)`__ where `A` is the domain, `B` is the codomain, and `R` is the actual relation given as the set of ordered pairs (pairs of related elements).

## Square relation
A heterogeneous relation is called a square relation to emphasize the fact that it has the square-symmetry, i.e. that it may be symmetrical about the main diagonal when presented in a matrix (table) form.

## Rectangular relation
A heterogeneous relation is called a rectangular relation to suggest that it does not have the square-symmetry of a homogeneous relation.

## Set-like relation
Set-like or local relation: for all x ‚àà X, the class of all `y` such that `yRx` is a set, which makes sense only if relations over proper classes are allowed.
For example, the usual ordering `<` over the class of ordinal numbers is a set-like relation, while its inverse (>) is not.
