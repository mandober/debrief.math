A binary relation `R` between sets `A` and `B` is a triple `𝓡 = (A,B,R)`, defined by the domain `A`, the codomain `B` and the set of the ordered pairs that make the actual relation, `R = {(a,b) | a ∈ A ⋀ b ∈ B }`.

- 𝓡 = (A,B,R)
- A is the domain, a ∈ A
- B is the codomain, b ∈ B
- R is the binary relation between A and B, R = {(a,b). a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}
- ∃a. a ∈ A ∧ ∃b. b ∈ B. (a,b) ∈ R
- { a | a ∈ (a,b) } ⊆ A
- { b | b ∈ (a,b) } ⊆ B
- ∃p ∈ R. p = (a,b). a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B (non-empty relation)
- ¬∃p ∈ R (empty relation)

The set of the ordered pairs (a,b) ∈ R implies a direction, that is, relations are directed. The first component in a pair is an element of domain, and it is connected to the second component of the pair which is an element of the codomain.

Not all elements of domain need to be related to an element in codomain. The set of all first components is the **pre-image**, a subset of the domain.

Not all elements of codomain B need to be related to an element in domain A. The set of all second components is a subset of the codomain, called an **image** or even a **range**.
