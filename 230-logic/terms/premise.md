# Premise

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise

A **premise** or **premiss** is a statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion. It is an assumption that something is true.

In logic, an *argument* requires a set of at least two *propositions* known as the premises, along with another proposition, known as the *conclusion*. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms *the basic argumentative structure*.

More complex arguments can use a sequence of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic.

The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument. Also, additional information is required over and above the meaning of the premise to determine if the full meaning of the conclusion coincides with what is.

For Euclid, premises constitute two of the three propositions in a syllogism, with the other being the conclusion. These, categorical propositions, contain 3 terms: subject and predicate of the conclusion, and the *middle term*. The subject of the conclusion is called the *minor term* while the predicate is the *major term*. The premise that contains the middle term and major term is called the *major premise* while the premise that contains the middle term and minor term is called the *minor premise*.

A premise can also be an indicator word if statements have been combined into a logical argument and such word functions to mark the role of one or more of the statements. It indicates that the statement it is attached to is a premise.
