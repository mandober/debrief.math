# Inductive Reasoning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning

**Inductive reasoning** is a method of reasoning in which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence, but not full assurance, of the truth of the conclusion.

It is also described as a method where one's experiences and observations, including what are learned from others, are synthesized to come up with a general truth.

Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning as the derivation of general principles from specific observations (arguing from specific to general), although there are many inductive arguments that do not have that form.

Inductive reasoning is distinct from *deductive reasoning*. While, if the premises are correct, the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the *truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable*, based upon the evidence given.
