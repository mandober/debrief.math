# Deductive reasoning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning

*Deductive reasoning* and its method, *deduction*, is studied in the *deductive logics*.

**Deduction** is the process of reasoning that starts with premises and proceeds to reach a logically certain conclusion. If all premises are true and the rules of inference were strictly followed, then the conclusion is necessarily true. Mathematics uses deductive reasoning.
