https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic

Mathematical logic is a formal system consisting of axioms and inference rules: by repeatedly applying the inference rules to the axioms (and to the previously derived theorems), new theorems can be one derived within the system.

For example, the definition of the natural numbers by *Peano axioms*: zero is a natural number; each natural number has a successor which is also a natural number. Therefore, starting with 0 and repeatedly applying the successor function we can generate a list of natural numbers (the new theorem).

> Mathematical logic studies and builds theorems about a system of objects, only the objects it deals with are the theorems themselves and the system of objects is the entire mathematics.

Mathematical logic studies the application of technics of formal logic to math, explores formal systems of deductive reasoning in formal proof systems.

Mathematical logic is closely associated to metamathematics, foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science.

> The aim of logic in CS is to develop formal languages that can model concepts so we can reason about these models by constructing valid arguments, which can be rigorously defended and proved, and, preferably mechanically, checked for correctness.
