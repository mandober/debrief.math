Church-Turing Thesis, AKA
- Computability Thesis
- Church-Turing conjecture
- Church's (hypo)thesis/conjecture on computability
- Turing's thesis

Church-Turing thesis is a
mathematically unprovable belief 
that a reasonable intuitive 
definition of computability 
is equivalent to the list 
of provably equivalent 
formal models of computation, 
and, intuitively, what is computable 
by a computer program 
written in any reasonable PL.

*Church-Turing Thesis* is a hypothesis about the nature of *computable functions* that states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method iff it is computable by a *Turing machine*.

Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term *effectively calculable* to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods.

In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability:
