## Intro

The recursive functions are a class of functions on the natural numbers studied in computability theory, a branch of contemporary mathematical logic which was originally known as recursive function theory.

Such functions take their name from the process of recursion by which the value of a function is defined by the application of the same function applied to smaller arguments.

Understood in this way, the defining equations provide an algorithm for computing an effective procedure for calculating its values, which can be carried out by a human or mechanical computing device within a finite number of steps.

It is for this reason that a class of recursive definitions, similar to that of general recursive functions, were first employed as the mathematical model of computation on which recursive function theory was originally founded.


Section 1 of this entry provides an overview of the foundational developments in logic and mathematics which led to the founding of recursive function theory in the 1930s.

Section 2 surveys different forms of recursive definitions, inclusive of the primitive and partial recursive functions which are most central to the classical development of this subject.

Section 3 provides an overview of computability theory, inclusive of the so-called Recursion Theorem - a result which highlights the centrality of recursion to computation in general as well as its relationship to self-reference.

Subsequent updates to this entry will provide an overview of subrecursive hierarchies employed in proof theory and computer science as well as a more comprehensive treatment of contemporary computability theory.
