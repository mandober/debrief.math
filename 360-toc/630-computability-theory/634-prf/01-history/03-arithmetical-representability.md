# Arithmetical Representability



The foregoing definition appears in Gödel's well-known, 1931's paper `"On formally undecidable propositions of Principia mathematica and related systems I"`.

As he observes immediately before presenting it, the definition of primitive recursion is in fact a digression from the main focus of the paper, i.e. *proving the incompleteness of the axiomatic system of arithmetic he calls `P`*.

In order to understand Gödel's contribution to the initial development of recursive function theory, it will be useful to attend both to some features of this system and also to his proof of the *First Incompleteness Theorem* itself.

One of Gödel's goals was thus to provide a mathematical definition of the term "recursive" which generalizes prior examples of recursive definability in a manner but also captures to as great an extent as possible the class of functions computable by a finite procedure. 

This led him to define the so-called *general recursive functions* whose isolation in turn played an important role in the formulation of *Church's Thesis*.

However Gödel's definition also took place against the backdrop of other work which had been inspired by Hilbert's original consideration of different forms of recursive definitions. It will now be useful to examine these developments.
