# Index :: Models of computation

The first formal model of computation was Lambda Calculus, created by Alonzo Church in 1936. In the April of 1936, Church published `An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory`, while Turing published `On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem` 8 months later, in the January of 1937.

## Models of computation - Timeline

Many models of computation have been proposed and they all have a notion of discrete time steps.

- *λ-calculus*
  was proposed by Alonzo Church in 1941. The λ-calculus enables one to speak of functions from sets of functions to sets of functions
- *Turing Machine*
  was proposed by Alan Turing in 1936
- *Post systems*
  were proposed by Emil Post in 1943. They are a generalization of Grammars
- *Wang machines*
  were proposed by Hao Wang in 1957
- *Markov Algorithms*
  were proposed by Andrei Andreivich Markov in the 1940's
- *Register machines*
  were proposed by Abraham Robinson and Calvin Elgot in the 1960's. They resemble an actual computer more than most models.
- *Random Access Machines*
  were proposed by Steven Cook and Robert Rechow in the 1970's. They resemble an actual computer more than most models.
