# Recursion scheme

Two ways of using the inductive building up of a type to define functions on that type can be distinguished, the iterative way and the primitive recursive way.

An **iterative function** 
is defined by induction 
on the building up of the type 
by defining the function value 
in terms of the previous values.

A **primitive recursive function** 
is also defined by induction, 
but now by defining the function value 
in terms of the previous values 
*and the previous inputs*.
