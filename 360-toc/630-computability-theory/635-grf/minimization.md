# Minimization operator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_operator

*Minimization*, aka the `μ`-operator or unbounded search operator, is a very different operator in that it can use unbounded loops.
The μ-operator searches for the least n ∈ ℕ with a given property.

Adding it to the 5 primitive recursive operators makes it possible to define all computable functions. The 5 PR operators extended with the μ-operator makes this model of computation equivalent to a TM (and with that, to λ-calculus, SK calculus, etc.).
