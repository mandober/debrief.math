# Automata Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory

**Automata theory** is the study of *abstract machines* and *automata*, as well as the *computational problems* that can be solved using them.



Automata theory defines various automata, which are also distinct models of computation. It studies them and classifies them by efficiency and computational power, although Theory of Computation, its parent field, enumerates all the computation models spread out across mathematics (models of computation are mostly described in ToC, particularly in Automata theory and Formal language theory, but some are also associated to logic, algebra).

Automata theory is closely related to Formal Language Theory; in fact, their parent field, Theory of Computation, lists them together as one of its 3 major subfields, along with *Computability theory* and *Complexity theory*.


## Automata

An **automaton** is a machine designed to follow a predefined sequence of operations automatically. The term hails from Greek `αὐτόματα` (self-acting).

In automata theory and formal language theory, an automaton (which is singular form of the plural 'automata') is a finite representation of a formal, possibly infinite, language.

Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they recognize, typically illustrated by the *Chomsky hierarchy*, which describes the relations between various languages and kinds of formalized logic.

Automata plays a major role in theory of computation, compiler theory, parsing theory, formal verification, artificial intelligence.
