# Word problem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_(mathematics)

In computational mathematics, a *word problem* is the problem of deciding whether two given expressions are equivalent with respect to a set of rewriting identities. A deep result of computational theory is that answering this question is in many important cases *undecidable*.

A prototypical example is the word problem for groups, but there are many other instances as well.
