## Finite-state automata
Finite automata, or more precisely, Finite-state automata (FSA) is computing based on moving between states in response to an input, as a very limited but still useful model of computation. The topics of interest to FSA include NFA, DFA, DFA â‰… NFA, regexp, the Pumping Lemma.

## Regular language
A regular language is a set of strings that can be described by one of the mathematical formalisms called "finite automaton", "regular grammar", or "regular expression", all of which have the same expressive power. A regular language is a formal language that can be defined by a regular expression; equivalently, a regular language can be defined as a language recognized by a finite automaton.

## Regular expression
The concept of regular expression was introduced by Kleene in 1951 via his definition of regular events.

## Kleene's theorem
The Kleene's theorem states that finite automata (DFA, NFA) and regular expressions (regex) are equivalent in their expressiveness for denoting a regular language.
