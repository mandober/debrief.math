# Philosophy of mathematics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics

*The philosophy of mathematics* is the *branch of philosophy* that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics. It aims to understand the nature and methods of mathematics, and find out the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.
