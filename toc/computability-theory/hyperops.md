# Hyperoperations

## Zeration, H0
- 0th hyperop
- successor function, successor operator
- succession
As the zeroth hyperoperation, successor is also called **zeration**: 
$$H_0(m, n) = 1 + n$$


The successor function is the level-0 foundation of the infinite Grzegorczyk hierarchy of hyperoperations, used to build addition, multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, etc.



## Addition, H1
The extension of zeration is addition, defined as *repeated succession*.

## Multiplication, H2
The extension of addition is multiplication, defined as *repeated addition*.

## Exponentiation, H3

## Tetration, H4


## Higher hyper ops

- Tetration, H4
- Pentation, H5
- Hexation, H5
