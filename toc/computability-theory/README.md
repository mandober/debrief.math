# Computability Theory

The central questions of computability theory:
- Classifying problems as solvable or unsolvable.
- Whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false.

In the 30's, it was discovered by Godel, Turing, Church that some of the fundamental problems in mathematics cannot be solved by a "computer" (even though computers crossed from theory into practice only in the 40's).

An example of such a problem is answering whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false. To tackle such a problem, formal definitions of the notions of computer, algorithm and computation were needed. The theoretical models that were proposed in order to understand solvable and unsolvable problems led to the development of computers.
