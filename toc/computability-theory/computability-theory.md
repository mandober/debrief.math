# Computability Theory

The central questions of computability theory:
- Classifying problems as solvable or unsolvable.
- Whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false.

In the 1930's, through the work of Godel, Turing, Church and others, it became apparent that some of the fundamental problems in mathematics cannot be solved by a computer (even though at the time computers existed only in theory).

An example of such a problem is answering whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false. But to tackle such a problem, formal definitions of the notions of *computer*, *algorithm* and *computation* were needed.

The theoretical models that were proposed in order to understand *solvable* and *unsolvable* problems led to the development of computers. These problems were grouped into computable and incomputable.
