# Computability Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory


**Computability theory**, formerly **Recursion theory**, studies computable functions and classifies algorithms and problems as solvable or unsolvable.

Computability Theory has expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability, and in these areas, it overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.

Computability Theory is a branch of the Theory of Computation.

Computability Theory has originated in the 1930s.

Computability Theory's central questions:
- *What does it mean for a function on the natural numbers to be computable?*
- *How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?*

Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, computability theory is studied in both, mathematics and CS, with each having interest in different aspects:

- Math
  - the theory of relative computability
  - reducibility notions
  - degree structures
- CS
  - the theory of subrecursive hierarchies
  - formal methods
  - formal languages

Computability Theory originated in the 1930's, through the work of Godel, Turing, Church and others, when it became apparent that some of the fundamental problems in mathematics cannot be solved by a computer (even though at the time computers were only a theoretical devices).

The central issue of recursion theory was whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false. But before tackling such problems, the notion of computer, algorithm and computation had to be formally defined first.

The theoretical models that were proposed to understand *computable*(solvable) and *incomputable* (unsolvable) problems led to the development of computers.
