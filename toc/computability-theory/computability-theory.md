# Computability Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory


**Computability theory**, known formerly as *recursion theory*, is a branch of the Theory of Computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and *Turing degrees*.* The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized *computability* and *definability*. In these areas, computability theory overlaps with *proof theory* and *effective descriptive set theory*.

Basic questions addressed by recursion theory include:
- What does it mean for a function on the natural numbers to be computable?
- How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?

Although there is considerable overlap in terms of knowledge and methods, mathematicians recursion theorists study the *theory of relative computability*, *reducibility notions* and *degree structures*.

People in CS field focus on the theory of subrecursive hierarchies, formal methods, and formal languages.




The central questions of computability theory:
- Classifying problems as solvable or unsolvable.
- Whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false.

In the 1930's, through the work of Godel, Turing, Church and others, it became apparent that some of the fundamental problems in mathematics cannot be solved by a computer (even though at the time computers existed only in theory).

An example of such a problem is answering whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false. But to tackle such a problem, formal definitions of the notions of *computer*, *algorithm* and *computation* were needed.

The theoretical models that were proposed in order to understand *solvable* and *unsolvable* problems led to the development of computers. These problems were grouped into computable and incomputable.
