In theoretical computer science, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with whether and how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm.

The field of Theory of Computation is divided into 3 major branches:
- Complexity Theory
- Computability Theory
- Automata Theory


In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?".


* Theory of Computation
  - Computation by abstract devices
    - Analysis of algorithms and problem complexity
      - Numerical Algorithms and Problems
      - Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems
      - Tradeoffs between Complexity Measures

Topics of ToC include:
- Decidability
