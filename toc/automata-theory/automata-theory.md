# Automata Theory

The central questions of automata theory:
* Whether different models have the same power?
* Can a certain model solve more problems than the other?

Automata theory deals with definitions and properties of different types of
computation models including:
- **Finite Automata**: used in text processing, compilers, hardware design.
- **Context-Free Grammars**: used to define programming languages. Also in AI.
- **Turing Machines**: form a simple abstract model of a computer.
