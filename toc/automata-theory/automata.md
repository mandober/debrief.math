Automata Theory ⊃ TM ⊃ Push-down automata ⊃ FSA ⊃ Combinatorial logic


Automata theory is the study of *abstract machines* and *automata*, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them.

It is a theory in *theoretical computer science* and *discrete mathematics* (a subject of study in both mathematics and computer science).

Noun sg. *"automaton"*, pl. *"automata"*, is from αὐτόματα "self-acting"

An **automaton** (pl. *automata*) is a machine designed to automatically follow a predetermined sequence of operations making it seem as if self-operating.

*Automata theory* is closely related to *formal language* theory. An automaton is a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set.

Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, typically illustrated by the *Chomsky hierarchy*, which describes the relations between various languages and kinds of formalized logic.

Automata play a major role in *theory of computation*, *compiler construction*, *artificial intelligence*, *parsing* and *formal verification*.
