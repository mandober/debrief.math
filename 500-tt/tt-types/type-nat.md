# Nat type

Type `Nat` is defined in Haskell as

```hs
-- as ADT
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat
-- as GADT
data Nat where
  Zero :: Nat
  Succ :: Nat ‚Üí Nat
```

and algebraically, this type is `N = 1 + N`.

Expressed type-theoretically it is the type `nat = ŒºŒ±.1 + Œ±`, where the two arms of the sum type represent the `Zero` and `Succ` data ctors.

`Zero` is a nullary data ctor isomorphic to the unit type, `ùüô`. It takes no args, so it stands for the natural 0 by itself.

`Succ` ctor takes one arg that must be a Nat. So `Succ Zero` represents nat 1, `Succ (Succ Zero)` represents nat 2, and so on.

```hs
N = 1 + N                    -- 0 or ‚Ä¶
N = 1 + (1 + N)              -- 0 or 1 or ‚Ä¶
N = 1 + (1 + (1 + N))        -- 0 or 1 or 2 or ‚Ä¶
N = 1 + (1 + (1 + (1 + N)))  -- 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or ‚Ä¶
```
