# Sort

Sort is a generalization of syntactical levels of a formal language.

- most PLs have 2 sorts: terms and types
- Haskell has 3 sorts: terms, types and kinds

Sort are usually associated with pure type systems, which can have any number of sorts. The rules of a language are then driven by the sorts and their dependencies.

Languages of the lambda cube have 3 sorts: `✱`, `◻`, `△`.

✱, ◻, △
