## Type theory

## Recap on Types

We have types i.e. spaces, `A`, and points i.e. elements, `a : A`, of that space that are always constructed according to some rules. A point always belongs to exactly one space.

Dependent type, `x : A ‚ä¢ B(x) type`, but since we have functions and universes, we can just think of a dependent type as `B` being a map from `A` into the universe of all types, `B : A -> ùí∞`. The view of dependent types is as a fibration from space `A` to fibers `B(x)`. We have a space `A` and then for every point `x : A`, there is a corresponding fiber `B(x)` which is the type over `x`, so for every `x` you get a different type of `B(x)`.

Then we had some basic type constructions like the unit type, `ùüô`, with a single term `‚òÖ : ùüò`. The empty type, `ùüò`, with no elements (uninhabited).

**Dependent products**: if we have a dependent type `x : A ‚ä¢ B(x) type`, then we can form a product type `Œ† (x:A) B(x)`, which may be interpreted as an indexed family of sets in set theory, or better as a *space of sections* in topology.

Dependent product is defined by a spece `A` (as a line) and above every point on the line, there is an associated fiber `B(x)`. A section takes each `x` and chooses a point in the associated fiber. So `t(x)` is a point for a single value `x`, the so-called *typical element*. The entire section is then a map which goes from `A` to the fibers. This is denoted by `Œª(x:A).t(x)`, which means `x ‚üº t(x)`, so it's a map taking each `x:A` to a point `t` that depends on `x` which lands in `B(x)`, ie. `t(x) : B(x)`. If we have such a map, we can then apply it. So given a section `f`, and given an `a : A`, then we can apply `f` to `a`, which is going to land in `B(a)`.

A special case of a product was an **exponential** or **function type**. A function type `A -> B` is just a special case when you have a dependent product but the fiber is constant. The fiber is always some constant type `B` that doesn't depend on `x`. Then we just get a function type `Œ† (x:A) B` or `B·¥¨`.

**Dependent sum**: `Œ£ (x:A) B(x)`, with geometric interpretation as the *total space of fibrations*. It is defined by a spece `A` (as a line) and above every point on the line, there is an associated fiber `B(x)`. A section takes each `x` and chooses a point in the associated fiber. The total space is all sections put together, it is a contour around all the fibers. The *typical element* of the sum is a pair `(a, b) : Œ£ (x:A) B(x)` where `a:A` and `b:B(a)`.

Along with two projections:
- `œÄ‚ÇÅ : Œ£ (x:A)‚ÅüB(x) -> A`
- `œÄ‚ÇÇ : Œ† (u‚Åü:‚ÅüŒ£‚Åü(x:A)‚ÅüB(x)) -> B(œÄ‚ÇÅ(u))`

The type of the first projection is a map from the total space to the base space `A`. The type of the second projection is more complex. `œÄ‚ÇÇ` needs to take something in the total space and map in somewhere - but where? That depends on `u`. Because it depends on where the `u` is, it is mapping into a fiber over `œÄ‚ÇÅ(u)`.

## Natural numbers

For the type of natural numbers, `‚Ñï`, we have the usual 4 kinds of rules. The formation rule has no assumptions and just states that `‚Ñï` is a type, which can also be expressed (in a type theory with universe of types) as `‚Ñï : ùí∞`.

```hs
-- ‚Ñï-formation:

------- ‚Ñïf       (OR)        ------- ‚Ñïf
‚Ñï : ùí∞                        ‚Ñï type


-- ‚Ñï-introduction:

------- ‚Ñïi-Z
0 : ‚Ñï

Œì ‚ä¢   n : ‚Ñï
------------- ‚Ñïi-S
Œì ‚ä¢ S n : ‚Ñï


-- ‚Ñï-elimination (induction principle):

Œì, x:‚Ñï         ‚ä¢                              D(x) type
Œì              ‚ä¢ a                          : D(0)
Œì, x:‚Ñï, y:D(x) ‚ä¢ b{- b deps on x and y -}   : D(S x)
---------------------------------------------------------- ‚Ñïe
Œì, x:‚Ñï         ‚ä¢ ind (a,b,x)                : D(x)

-- Conclusion of ‚Ñï-elim indeed is a pi-type, Œ† (n:‚Ñï) D(n)
-- obtained by abstracting over n:‚Ñï in the premise
-- (while ignoring the ind(a,b,x) term?!)


-- ‚Ñï-computation:

Œì, x:‚Ñï         ‚ä¢                                      D(x) type
Œì              ‚ä¢ a                                  : D(0)
Œì, x:‚Ñï, y:D(x) ‚ä¢ b                                  : D(S x)
------------------------------------------------------------------ ‚Ñï-Œ≤
Œì              ‚ä¢ ind (a, b, 0)   = a                : D(0)
Œì              ‚ä¢ ind (a, b, S x) = b[y:=ind(a,b,x)] : D(S x)
```


### Induction principle in Agda

```agda hs
-- induction principle on ‚Ñï
‚Ñï-elim : {A : ‚Ñï ‚Üí Type}
       ‚Üí A 0                           -- base case: if A holds for 0
       ‚Üí ((k : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí A k ‚Üí A (succ k))  -- rec case
       ‚Üí (n : ‚Ñï)                       -- n : ‚Ñï
       ‚Üí A n                           -- conclusion: then A holds ‚àÄn:‚Ñï
‚Ñï-elim {A} f g n = h n
  where
  h : (n : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí A n
  h zero     = f
  h (succ n) = g n (h n)
```


The type-theoretic version of the **induction principle** is something that allows you to create sections, i.e. maps over over the natural numbers. The induction principle is an elimination rule, it deconstructs natural numbers. It is a direct generalization of the usual induction principle.

Given these input data:
- a dependent type over the natural numbers, `P : ‚Ñï -> ùí∞` (a type family over the natural numbers)
- a point, i.e. base case, `b : P(0)`

The goal is to get a section of the fibration, because to say that something holds for every `n` means that every `P` is inhabited.

We need a way of creating a section. We have a point to start with, and now we just need a way of always moving forward, always getting to the next point.

What we need is a sort of a passage function `f` of `n`. We need a map which goes from each fiber to the next for every `n`. Once we have that `f`, we'll just keep applying it. `f` takes in a number and gives back a map from `P(n)` to `P(S n)`. When applied to a particular `n`, we get a pass from `P(n)` to the next fiber, `P(S n)`. We are trying to inhabit one of these `P(k)`'s, so we also have a natural number `k`. We want to produce something in `P(k)`.

We need to translate math induction into type theory, to retrieve the induction principle that additionally can also deal with dependent types.


### Defining addition

```hs
x:‚Ñï ‚ä¢ x:‚Ñï         x:‚Ñï, y:‚Ñï, z:‚Ñï ‚ä¢ S‚Åüz:‚Ñï
---------       ------------------------
  x:‚Ñï, y:‚Ñï ‚ä¢ ind(x, S‚Åüz, y) : ‚Ñï
----------------------------------------
  x:‚Ñï ‚ä¢ Œªy.ind(x, S‚Åüz, y) : ‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï
----------------------------------------
  ‚ä¢ Œªx.Œªy.ind(x, S‚Åüz, y) : ‚Ñï ‚Üí (‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï)
```

Compared to the lhs of the ‚Ñï-elim rule, 
`Œì  , x:‚Ñï, y:D(x)`, here we have 
`x:‚Ñï, y:‚Ñï, z:D(x)`, that is, 
`x:‚Ñï, y:‚Ñï, z:‚Ñï` (since `D(x)` is `‚Ñï`).
