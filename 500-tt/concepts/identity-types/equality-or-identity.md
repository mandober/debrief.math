# On equality or identity

In type theory, **identity type** represents the concept of equality. It is also known as *propositional equality* to differentiate it from judgemental (definitional, syntactical) equality.

Historically called *identity types*, in homotopy type theory also called *path types* to emphasize their correspondence with geometry. From a homotopy theorist's point of view, identity types and their connection to homotopy theory are perfectly natural: they are *path objects* in the category of types.

Identity types are just one particular *inductive family* of types.

In intensional type theory, under the propositions-as-types paradigm, an *identity type (or equality type)* is the incarnation of equality.

For any type `A` and any terms `x,y:A`, the type `Idᴀ(x,y)` is the type of proofs that `x = y`.
