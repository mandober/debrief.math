## Different kinds of equality

Here is a list of distinctions between different notions of equality, in different contexts, where possibly all the following pairs of notions are, in turn, "the same", just expressed in terms of different terminologies:
- the difference between axiomatic and defined equality
- the difference between identity and equality
- the difference between intensional and extensional equality
- the difference between equality judgements and equality propositions
- the difference between equality and isomorphism
- the difference between equality and equivalence
- the possibility of operations that might not preserve equality

## In type theory

In a formal language such as type theory, one distinguishes various different notions of equality (or equivalence) of the terms of the language.

NB. Both intensional and extensional type theories may distinguish between intensional and extensional equality (and whether the type theory satisfies function extensionality is yet a separate issue).

### Definitional equality

The most basic notion of equality is *definitional equality* or *intensional equality* (or judgemental equality) (or computational equality?).

According to Per Martin-Löf's paper from 1980 (page 31)

Definitional equality is *intensional equality*, 
or *equality of meaning (synonymy)*. 
It is a relation between linguistic expressions. 
Definitional equality is the *equivalence relation* 
generated by 
- *abbreviatory definitions*, 
- changes of bound variables and
- the principle of substituting equals for equals. 
Definitional equality can be *used to rewrite expressions*.


… intensional (sameness of meaning) …

For instance the symbols "2" and "s(s(0))" (meaning the successor of the successor of 0) are definitionally/intensionally equal terms (of type the natural numbers): the first is merely an abbreviation for the second.
