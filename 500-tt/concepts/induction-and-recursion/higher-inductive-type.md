# Higher inductive type

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher+inductive+type

**Higher inductive types** (HITs) 
are a generalization of inductive types 
which allow the constructors to produce, 
not just points of the type being defined, 
but also elements of its *iterated identity types*.

While HITs are already useful in extensional type theory, 
they are the most useful and powerful in homotopy type theory, 
where they allow the construction of 
cell complexes, homotopy colimits, truncations, localizations, 
and many other objects from classical homotopy theory.

Defining what a HIT is "in general" 
is an open research problem. 
One mostly precise proposal may be found in [ShulmanLumsdaine16]. 
A more syntactic description of a class of HITs may be found in [Brunerie16]. 

A solution to this problem should determine 
how to define the concept of an elementary (âˆž,1)-topos.
