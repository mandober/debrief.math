# Type theory :: Index :: System X

- STLC
  - functions from terms to terms
- System F
  - polymorphic lambda calculus
  - λ2, second-order lambda calculus
  - formalizes parametric polymorphism
  - functions from types to terms
  - strongly normalizing
  - corresponds to a fragment of second-order intuitionistic logic that uses only universal quantification
  -  type inference (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable
- System Fω
  - functions from types to types where the argument (and result) may be of any order.
- System F$_{<:}$
  - extension of system F with subtyping
- System U
- System μ
- System F with Type Equality Coercions
- System f-omega with equirecursive types for datatype-generic ...
- Higher-order modules in System Fω and Haskell
- Relating System F and λ2
- System FC

- λ→, Simply typed lambda calculus
- λ2, System F
