# Observational type theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_type_theory

Observational Type Theory (OTT) combines beneficial aspects of Intensional type theory (ITT) and Extensional type theory (ETT).

It separates definitional equality (which is decidable as in ITT), and a substitutive propositional equality, capturing extensional equality of functions, as in ETT.
