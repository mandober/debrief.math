# Setoid type theory

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-030-33636-3_7

We introduce setoid type theory, an intensional type theory with a proof-irrelevant universe of propositions and an equality type satisfying function extensionality, propositional extensionality and a definitional computation rule for transport. We justify the rules of setoid type theory by a syntactic translation into a pure type theory with a universe of propositions. We conjecture that our syntax is complete with regards to this translation.
