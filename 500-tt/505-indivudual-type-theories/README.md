# Type Theory :: Type Theories

This section indexes and descibes type theories.

Due to their number some classification is attempted, but since the *classification criteria* is unclear, dubious classes (like "flavours" and "propriatary systems") are used at the moment. The separation between a "proper" type theory and a type system is mixed up as well.

Unordered list of type theories, followed by a list of type theories with existing pages.

Possible criteria of classification
- trivial (chronologically, alphabetically)
- structural vs substructural type systems
- by opposing pairs

Possible classes of division
- type system
- by flavor (?)
- Î» calculi
