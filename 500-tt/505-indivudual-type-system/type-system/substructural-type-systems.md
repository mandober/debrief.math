# Substructural type systems

Normally, variables can be used multiple times.

`Î“` is a context mapping variables to their types. We treat `Î“` as a (possibly empty) unordered list of the form `x1 : Ï„1, â€¦, xn : Ï„n`.

Now think of elements of Î“ as being "used up" whenever they are referenced.


```hs
Î“, x : Ï„, x : Ï„ âŠ¢ x : Ï„
------------------------- Contraction
Î“, x : Ï„ âŠ¢ x : Ï„


```

## Affine type system

Variables can be used at most once.

Rust has affine types.

Consider this program without affine types: `fun f x = []`.
>Can x be garbage collected at the end of `f`?
Not necessarily - `f`'s caller may continue to reference `x`.

What about with affine types?
`fun f x = []`
>Can x be garbage collected at the end of `f`?
Yes! `f`'s caller can no longer refer to `x` after passing it to `f`.

Rust has no global garbage collector at runtime - it needs to statically know when to dispose of values.

## Concurrency

```ml
val t = create_thread ()
val x = ref 0

(* Send x to another thread *)
val () = send t x

(* Possible race *)
val () = x := 1
```

Concurrency with affine types

```ml
val t = create_thread ()
val x = ref 0

(* Send x to another thread *)
val () = send t x

(* Compiler error *)
val () = x := 1

(* Instead do *)
val x = recv t
val () = x := 1
```

## Linear Type System

>Variables must be used exactly once.

Great for managing resources like FS items (opening/closing files).

```hs
Î“ âŠ¢ e : Ï„
------------------- Weakening
Î“, x : Ïƒ âŠ¢ e : Ï„
```

## Ordered Type System

substructural logic: relevance logic.

>Variables must be used exactly once, in the order they were introduced.


```hs
Î“, x : Ï„, x : Ï„, âˆ† âŠ¢ x : Ï„
----------------------------- Contraction
Î“, x : Ï„,        âˆ† âŠ¢ x : Ï„


Î“,        âˆ† âŠ¢ e : Ï„
--------------------- Weakening
Î“, x : Ïƒ, âˆ† âŠ¢ e : Ï„


Î“, x : Ïƒ, y : ÏƒÊ¹, âˆ† âŠ¢ e : Ï„
----------------------------- Exchange
Î“, y : ÏƒÊ¹, x : Ïƒ, âˆ† âŠ¢ e : Ï„
```



>A **substructural type system** is one which omits one or more of contraction, weakening, and exchange.


Type System | Exchange | Weakening | Contraction
------------|----------|-----------|------------
Normal      | âœ“        | âœ“         | âœ“
Relevant    | âœ“        | ğŸ—´         | âœ“
Affine      | âœ“        | âœ“         | ğŸ—´
Linear      | âœ“        | ğŸ—´         | ğŸ—´
