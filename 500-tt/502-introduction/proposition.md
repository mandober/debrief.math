# Proposition

In logic, a *proposition* is a statement with a particular truth value; which of the two truth values exactly, is something that we can argue about.

Opposed to a proposition is a *judgement*, which is also a statement (an assertion) that is taken for granted, "as is", because it makes no sense to discuss its truth value, and in that regard it behaves similarly to an axiom. Unlike a judgement, a proposition is a statement the truth value of which may attract prolonged, century-spanning discussions.

In type theory, a *proposition* is identified with a type, acting as a collection of all its proofs, and a *type* is identified with the proposition that it has a *term*; so that each of its terms, is in turn, a proof of the corresponding proposition.
