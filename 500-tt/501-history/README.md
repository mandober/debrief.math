Type theory is a major mathematical theory and discipline. It was invented relatively soon after the introduction of set theory as an attempt to resolve problems in it. However, type theory is more related to logic, lambda calculus and theory of computation in general, and particularly with computer science where it is manifested in the form of type systems.
