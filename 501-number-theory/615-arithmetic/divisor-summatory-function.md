# Divisor Summatory Function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_summatory_function

In number theory, the **divisor summatory function** is a function that is a sum over the *divisor function*.

It frequently occurs in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the Riemann zeta function.

The various studies of the behaviour of the divisor function are sometimes called **divisor problems**.
