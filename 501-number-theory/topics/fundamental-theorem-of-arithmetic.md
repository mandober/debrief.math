# Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic

In number theory, **the fundamental theorem of arithmetic**, also called **the unique factorization theorem** or **the unique-prime-factorization theorem**, states that every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number, or it can be represented as the product of prime numbers. Moreover, this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors.

Every positive integer n > 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a *product of prime powers*. ∀n ∈ ℕᐩᐩ. n ∈ ℙ ⋁ 🖕 n = ∏ pₙʲ

n = p₁ᵃ · pᵇ · pᶜ · … · pₙʲ = ∏ pₙʲ

The primes, raised to some power, are the factors of any composite number. It can be said that any composite number is a factor of powers of *all the prime numbers*; the primes not needed for factorizing a particular number can be raised to the zeroth power.


ℙ = {2,3,5,7,11,13,...} 

2  = 2¹             oo
3  =    3¹          ooo
4  = 2²             oo oo
5  =       5¹       ooooo
6  = 2¹ 3¹          ooo ooo
7  =         7¹     ooooooo
8  = 2³             oo oo oo
9  =    3²          ooo ooo ooo
10 = 2¹   5¹

The **Euclid's lemma**: if a prime `p` divides the product of two integers `ab`, then `p` must divide at least one of them.
