# Transfinite number

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_number

Transfinite numbers are numbers that are "infinite" in the sense that they are larger than all finite numbers, yet not necessarily *absolutely infinite*.

They include the *transfinite cardinals*, which are cardinal numbers used to quantify the size of infinite sets, and the *transfinite ordinals*, which are ordinal numbers used to provide an ordering of infinite sets.

The term "transfinite" was coined by Georg Cantor in 1895, who wished to avoid some of the implications of the word "infinite" in connection with these objects, which were, nevertheless, not finite. Few contemporary writers share these qualm: it is now accepted usage to refer to transfinite cardinals and ordinals as "infinite". Nevertheless, the term "transfinite" also remains in use.

Any finite natural number can be used in at least two ways: as an ordinal and as a cardinal. *Cardinal numbers* specify the size of sets, whereas *ordinal numbers* specify the order of a member within an ordered set. When extended to transfinite numbers, these two concepts become distinct. A **transfinite cardinal** number is used to describe the size of an infinitely large set, while a **transfinite ordinal** is used to describe the location within an infinitely large ordered set.

The most notable ordinal and cardinal numbers are, respectively:

* `ω` (omega): **the lowest transfinite ordinal number**. It is also the *order type* of the natural numbers under their usual linear ordering.

* `ℵ₀` (aleph-naught): the first transfinite cardinal number. It is also the cardinality of the natural numbers. If the axiom of choice holds, the next higher cardinal number is aleph-one, `ℵ₁`. If not, there may be other cardinals which are incomparable with aleph-one and larger than aleph-null. Either way, there are no cardinals between aleph-null and aleph-one.
