Counting is used to determine the number of objects with certain properties. For examples: The number of SIM cards a company has to produce if they've been assigned 7 digit numbers. Number of possible match starters (football, basketball) given the number of team members and their positions. 

Basic counting rules
- Counting problem may be complex, so simplify it using decomposition.
- Basic decomposition rules:
  * *Product rule* 
    count decomposes into a sequence of dependent counts; each element in the first count is associated with all elements of the second count.
  * *Sum rule* 
    count decomposes into a set of independent counts; elements of counts are alternatives.

Techniques for determining, without direct enumeration, the number of possible outcomes of particular event or the number of elements in a set. Such counting is sometimes called *combinatorial analysis*. It includes the study of *permutations* and *combinations*.
