# Mathematical formulas :: Arithmetic :: Powers and radicals

1. Power definition:
  - `mⁿ = m ∙ … ∙ m` (n times) and `n ∈ ℕ`
  - right-associative: `a^b^c = a^(b^c)`
  - associative-inequality: `(a^b)^c ≠ a^(b^c)`

2. Edge-case powers where `n ∈ ℤ`
  - Integer to the zeroth power: `n⁰ = 1`
  - Zero to the zeroth power: `0⁰ = 1` (by convention)
  - Zero to the nth power:    `0ⁿ = 0`
  - Integer to the first power:  `n¹ = n`

3. Negative power
  - Inverse: `a⁻¹ = 1/a`
  - Integer to the negative power `a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ`
  - Fraction to the negative power: `(a/b)⁻ⁿ = (b/a)ⁿ = bⁿ/aⁿ`

4. Multiplication with the same bases: `aⁿ ∙ aᵐ = aⁿᐩᵐ`
5. Exponentiation of powers: `(aⁿ)ᵐ = aⁿᵐ = (aᵐ)ⁿ`
6. Mul of powers: `(ab)ⁿ = aⁿbⁿ` where `n ∈ ℤ` and `a,b ∈ ℝᐩ`
7. Fraction to the nth power: `(a/b)ⁿ = aⁿ/bⁿ`
8. Division of powers: `aⁿ/aᵐ = aⁿ⁻ᵐ`
9. Relationship between power and log: `m^(n ∙ log ₘ  a)` = `aⁿ`
