*"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, isolation, confusion, restlessness, sexual frustration and social alienation which is being felt by a generation of disenfranchised devs amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack in the middle of these bug ridden times. Sign o' the times"* -- Simon Ferocious ðŸª‘ðŸª‘ðŸª‘ðŸª‘ðŸª‘
