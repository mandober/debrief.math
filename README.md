## About

"Donnie, you're out of your element!" lo-fi collection of math notes.

Largely scrubbed from Wikipedia. An unremarkable copypasta of articles intended to be consulted never again. Otherwise, each subsequent visit should digests the content further, compressing the topics down to their bare essentials, provided internalization kicks in.

Topics: the foundations of mathematics, mathematical logic, proof theory, set theory, relation theory, order theory, domain theory, function theory, graph theory, lambda calculi, type theory, abstract algebra, category theory.

Classification of topics is still a hard problem. Topics belonging to both math and CS (theory of computation and programming language theory in particular) span across both math and cs tiers. Should consolidate multiple copies in one place.

## Topics

## Dubious endorsements

* *"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that provokes and reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusing restlessness, socio-sexual frustration or otherwise derived alienation endured by a generation of disenfranchised devs, amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack right in the bug-ridden sigh of our times."* -- Simon Ferocious

* _"An almost language-free communication of ideas previously though improbable. The lure of imaginary is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of desire plugs the leaks of abstraction setting in motion the entirety of implied events."_-- Phineas Gage 👨‍🚒👨‍🚒

* _"C'est un espace trop chiffré, n'est-ce pas?"_ -- Abraham Surd 🪑🪑🪑

* _"Huius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet."_ -- F-Monk

* *...a preeminently peerless pile of 💩* -- drich
