*"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusion, restlessness, sexual frustration and social alienation which is being felt by a generation of disenfranchised logicians amidst the declining ecological situation and bland demo scene at the end of 2010s."* -- Simon Ferocious ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
