### About

A collection of notes about math, largely from Wikipedia, a copypasta pile of articles intended never to be looked at again. Covering the topics that include the foundations of mathematics, set theory, relation theory, order theory, domain theory, function theory, graph theory, mathematical logic, proof theory, lambda calculi, type theory, abstract algebra, category theory. Fields that are part of both math and CS, primarily, the theory of computation, along with its subfields, lack a permanent settlement (biased towards debrief.math).

* `TC` Theory of Computation


### Biased endorsements

*"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that provokes and reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusing restlessness, socio-sexual frustration or otherwise derived alienation endured by a generation of disenfranchised devs, amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack right in the bug-ridden sigh of our times."* -- Simon Ferocious 🚌🚏🐀👜

_"An almost language-free communication of ideas previously though improbable. The lure of imaginary is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of desire plugs the leaks of abstraction setting in motion the entirety of implied events."_-- Phineas Gage 👨‍🚒👨‍🚒

_"C'est un espace trop chiffré, n'est-ce pas?"_ -- Abraham Surd 🪑🪑🪑
