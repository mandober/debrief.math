## Dubious endorsements

* *"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that provokes and reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusing restlessness, socio-sexual frustration or otherwise derived alienation endured by a generation of disenfranchised devs, amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack right in the bug-ridden sigh of our times."* -- Simon Ferocious

* _"An almost language-free communication of ideas previously though improbable. The lure of imaginary is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of desire plugs the leaks of abstraction setting in motion the entirety of implied events."_-- Phineas Gage

* _"C'est un espace trop chiffré, n'est-ce pas?"_ -- Abraham Surd 🪑🪑🪑

* _"Huius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet."_ -- F. Monks

* *...a preeminently peerless pile of 💩* -- dung


## About

Lo-fi collection of lowly-fi math notes as a collection of dissimilar notions lacking overall homogeneity. An unremarkable copypasta scrubbed from internet sources, intended to be consulted very often, but too often; its value lies elsewhere, it is said. Donnie, you're out of your element! Each subsequent page view must accomplish a thingamabob: verify comprehension, improve summary, aid further digestion, providing plenty of elaborated digressions veering off into senseless rants whenever an attempt is made to write anything of substance or any kind of matter-of-fucked-tual /-ʃʊəl/ relevance (ad hoc is exempli gratia). Should the internalization of material come to pass, related articles are to be compressed down to bare essentials expressed as bullits. Proceeding to gnash (חרק) his teeth (שנים) biting the recess lady's breasts. Clean off. ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων.
