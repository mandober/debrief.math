## Solicited commendations

*"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusion, restlessness, sexual frustration and social alienation which is being felt by a generation of disenfranchised programmers amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness in the midst of the artificial age culture."* -- Simon Ferocious ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
