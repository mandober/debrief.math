### About

Lo-fi math notes collection.

Lo-fi collection of notes about mathematics.

Lo-fi collection of notes about mathematics, mostly originating from Wikipedia; in fact, an unremarkable copypasta of articles intended to be consulted never again; otherwise, the intention is that each visit to a page condenses its contents furter by distilling the subject down to the most significant bits of information.

Topics include: the foundations of mathematics, set theory, relation theory, order theory, domain theory, function theory, graph theory, mathematical logic, proof theory, lambda calculi, type theory, abstract algebra, category theory. Fields belonging to both math and CS (Theory of Computation, in particular) span across both debrief.math and debrief.cs debrief/debris.

#### Biased endorsements

* *"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that provokes and reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusing restlessness, socio-sexual frustration or otherwise derived alienation endured by a generation of disenfranchised devs, amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack right in the bug-ridden sigh of our times."* -- Simon Ferocious

* _"An almost language-free communication of ideas previously though improbable. The lure of imaginary is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of desire plugs the leaks of abstraction setting in motion the entirety of implied events."_-- Phineas Gage 👨‍🚒👨‍🚒

* _"C'est un espace trop chiffré, n'est-ce pas?"_ -- Abraham Surd 🪑🪑🪑

* _"Huius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet."_ -- F-Monk

* *...a pre-eminently peerless stinker* -- drich

#### Methodology

┌─ The method: ──────────┐    
│○ (verbatim) copypasta  │    
│┌ ○ digest <─────────┐  │    
││ ○ destill          │  │    
││ ○ instill          │  │
