## Reviews (positive-biased preset)

*"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that provokes and reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusing restlessness, socio-sexual frustration or otherwise derived alienation endured by a generation of disenfranchised devs, amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack the bug-ridden sigh of our times."* -- Simon Ferocious ðŸª‘ðŸª‘ðŸª‘ðŸª‘

_"The lure of imaginary totality is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of desire fastens the screws loose without symbolic chains. An almost language-free communication of ideas that was previously though impossible."_ 
-- Hugh Mann ðŸª‘ðŸª‘

_"C'est un espace trop chiffrÃ©, n'est-ce pas?"_ -- S. Panza ðŸª‘
