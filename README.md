### About

A collection of notes about CS-related mathematical topics including the foundations of mathematics, set theory, relation theory, order theory, function theory, graph theory, mathematical logic, proof theory, lambda calculi, type theory, abstract algebra, category theory.

Beside discrete math, other areas of mathematics are sporadically covered, while others, primarily the theory of computation, are currently split between debrief.math and debrief.cs.

* `ML` Mathematical Logic
* `PT` Proof Theory
* `LC` Lambda Calculi
* `TT` Type Theory

### Biased endorsements

*"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that provokes and reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusing restlessness, socio-sexual frustration or otherwise derived alienation endured by a generation of disenfranchised devs, amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack the bug-ridden sigh of our times."* -- Simon Ferocious 🚌🚏🐀👜

_"An almost language-free communication of ideas previously though improbable. The lure of imaginary is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of desire plugs the leaks of abstraction setting in motion the entirety of implied events."_-- Phineas Gage 👨‍🚒👨‍🚒

_"C'est un espace trop chiffré, n'est-ce pas?"_ -- Abraham Surd 🪑🪑🪑
