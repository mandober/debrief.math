Positivist philosopher *Auguste Comte* (1798–1857) first proposed a "natural" ordering of scientific disciplines based on generality of subject matter.

From mathematics to sociology, his *Hierarchy of the Sciences (HOS)* was intended to reflect the growing complexity, inter-dependence, and vicinity to human passions of research fields, all of which determined their level of development as sciences.

This idea was abandoned by post-positivist thinking, who increasingly emphasised the irrational side of scientific progress, leading to the extreme opposite view that disciplines are an unordered product of historical and cultural contingencies, similar to political or artistic currents.


## Hard and Soft Science

Today, concepts like "hard" and "soft" science are used in a vague, confused sense, and their imputation to specific research fields is felt to be controversial if not offensive. This might be a costly mistake, because these concepts seem to capture an essential feature of science, and have important implications that today tend to be ignored.

What do we mean by "hard" science?     
Scholars have treated the topic from a multitude of angles, but all definitions seem to converge on the concept of consensus – consensus, for example, "on the significance of new knowledge and the continuing relevance of old".

In an ideal science, scholars share a common background of established theories, facts and methods. This allows them to agree (usually after debate and further evidence) on the validity and significance of a new research finding, making it the basis for further theorizing and research. Harder sciences are hypothesised to come closer to this ideal. Moving towards "softer" fields, this consensus becomes less likely to be reached, the common background shrinks and fractures, and so data become less able to "speak for themselves". Already in Comte's intuition, this happened primarily because of the increasing complexity of subject matters.

What do we mean by complexity?     
The exact definition is still debated in complexity science itself, and so are its possible measures. In very general terms, however, the complexity of a system is linked to the number of elements involved, their diversity, the number and non-linearity of interactions between them, the cohesiveness of internal versus external relationships (which determines how isolated the system is), the distance from thermodynamic equilibrium. Complex systems require longer (uncompressible) descriptions and are less predictable in their behaviour.

Clearly, the systems studied by individual disciplines vary widely in these characteristics. It is also clear, however, that complexity generally increases with increasing levels of organization of matter. From subatomic particles to human societies, there is an overall increase in the possible number of elements, combinations, interactions etc. the phenomenon of emergence might bring relative simplicity at higher levels, but the overall trend is for complexity to increase.

And whilst phenomena get more complex, our ability to study them decreases. Objects of investigation become more difficult to isolate and describe, and are more diversified in space and time.

Due to technical, practical and ethical considerations, experiments and predictions are replaced by observations and accommodations, which are arguably a less powerful and reliable sources of knowledge. These limits make replication less likely to be attempted and to be successful. Moreover, the growing diversity and contingency of studied phenomena leads to a dispersion of research funding and efforts, further reducing the potential to reach conclusive evidence and settle intellectual debates.

The fundamental prediction made by a modern version of the HOS, therefore, is that the ability of a scientific field to achieve consensus and accumulate knowledge will decrease when moving from the physical, to the biological, to the social sciences. The same prediction should hold, of course, at finer levels of analysis, and we would expect that, within each domain, individual disciplines, fields and subfields vary significantly in their level of softness. However, since we lack objective methods to measure and rank complexity at such levels, finer-grained tests would be inaccurate.

How mathematics and the humanities fit into the HOS is rather unclear. In Comte's scheme, the humanities were excluded whilst mathematics was the basis of the hierarchy. The predictions developed here, however, are based on the assumption that disciplinary practices are constrained by physical properties of subject matter. Both mathematics and the humanities have purely intellectual subject matters, and therefore technically lack any physical constraint. On the other hand, these two disciplines are arguably at the extremes of a spectrum of consensus-reaching potential, and will therefore be included in a secondary test.

The HOS prediction stands in contrast with two alternatives philosophical positions. The first, very common amongst academics as well as lay-people, draws a fundamental distinction between natural and social sciences (i.e. sociology, psychology, etc.), and uses the term "soft science" to indicate the latter. Alternatively, the term "soft" is used to distinguish qualitative research or historical-philosophical studies. 

Reflecting a more general divide in Western culture, this dichotomy can be traced back to another long-standing debate, between those who see the study of human behaviour akin to any other science, i.e. aimed at discovering general patterns and laws, and those who believe it should focus on individuality and on the meaning that people ascribe to their world and actions.

In principle, of course, the two purposes are not mutually exclusive, but many scholars in the social sciences and humanities maintain that consciousness, free will and socio-cultural life make human beings a completely different subject matter from those of the natural sciences.

The second alternative hypothesis, also very common in academia and popular culture, denies any order at all. Disciplines, under this view, deal with different phenomena and produce different kinds of knowledge, so they cannot be compared in any meaningful way – let alone be ranked. In its more radical forms, this view explicitly denies the existence of a hierarchy, and replaces it by a "disordered" view of knowledge, in which the sciences only superficially resemble each other.

The HOS hypothesis can therefore be readily contrasted with, on the one hand, a dichotomy hypothesis (which we will call "two cultures") and, on the other hand, a null hypothesis, in which there is no particular order. Key to distinguishing these predictions are the biological sciences, which should fall in-between the physical and the social only according to the HOS.
