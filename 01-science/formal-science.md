# Formal sciences

The formal sciences are concerned with formal systems:
- Logic
- Mathematics
- Statistics
- Information Theory
- Theoretical Computer Science
- Systems Theory
- Decision Theory
- Theoretical Linguistics


Unlike the other sciences that are based on empirical knowledge, the formal sciences are concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules.

Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of scientific models dealing with observable reality, and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.

### Logic
**Logic is the formal systematic study of the principles of valid inference and correct reasoning**. Logic examines general forms which arguments may take, which forms are valid, and which are fallacies. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in philosophy, mathematics, semantics and computer science. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: epistemology, ethics, metaphysics. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid inferences within some formal language. Logic is also studied in argumentation theory.

### Mathematics
Mathematics is a formal science, similar to empirical sciences in the way how objective, careful and systematic study is employed to obtain knowledge; it also differs from them in that the method of verifying knowledge is a priori, rather than empirical.

### Statistics
Statistics is the study of the collection, organization and interpretation of data. It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. A statistician is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a wide number of fields. There is also a discipline called *mathematical statistics*, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

### Theoretical computer science
Theoretical computer science is a subset of general CS and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing. These divisions and subsets include analysis of algorithms and formal semantics of programming languages. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions besides these two. Each of the multiple parts have their own individual personal leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.

### Systems theory
Systems theory is the interdisciplinary study of systems in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of systems thinking and a generalization of systems science. In this context the word "systems" is used to refer specifically to *self-regulating systems*, that are capable of correcting themselves through feedback. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems and in climate.

### Decision theory
Decision theory in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game theory.
