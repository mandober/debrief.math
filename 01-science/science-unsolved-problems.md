An **open problem** is a known problem that can be accurately stated, which is assumed to have an objective and verifiable solution, but for which no solution is yet known. Through history, some of the supposedly open problems were resolved by showing they were ill defined.

In mathematics, many open problems are concerned with whether certain definitions are consistent. Two notable examples in mathematics that have been solved and closed by researchers in the late XX century are **Fermat's Last Theorem** and the **four color theorem**. An important open mathematics problem solved in the early XXI century is the **Poincar√© conjecture** (so it's not a conjecture anymore, but the name sticks).
