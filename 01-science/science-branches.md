# Branches of Science

The branches of science are commonly divided into 3 major groups: 
Formal, Natural and Social sciences.

1. **Formal** sciences
  - use *a priori* methodology
  - Branches
    - Mathematics
    - Logic
    - Statistics
2. **Natural** sciences
  - the study of natural phenomena and universal factors
  - use *empirical* methodology
  - commonly divided into 2 major groups:
    - Physical science
    - Biological (life) science
3. **Social** sciences
  - use *empirical* methodology
  - the study of human behavior and societies


Natural and social sciences are empirical sciences, meaning that the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions. This verifiability may well vary even within a scientific discipline.

Natural, social and formal science make up the fundamental sciences, which form the basis of *interdisciplinary* and *applied* sciences (such as engineering and medicine).

Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertise.



## Formal sciences

Main articles: Formal sciences and Outline of formal science

The formal sciences are the branches of science that are concerned with formal systems, such as logic, mathematics, theoretical computer science, information theory, systems theory, decision theory, statistics, and theoretical linguistics.

Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world (empirical knowledge), but rather with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules. Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of scientific models dealing with observable reality, and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.


Decision theory
Main article: Decision theory
Decision theory in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game theory.

Logic
Main articles: Logic and Outline of logic
Logic (from the Greek λογική logikē)[6] is the formal systematic study of the principles of valid inference and correct reasoning. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of philosophy, mathematics, semantics, and computer science. Logic examines general forms which arguments may take, which forms are valid, and which are fallacies. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: epistemology, ethics, metaphysics. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid inferences within some formal language.[7] Logic is also studied in argumentation theory.[8]

Mathematics
Main articles: Mathematics and Outline of mathematics
Mathematics, first of all known as The Science of numbers which is classified in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science,[9][10] has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods.[11]

Statistics
Main articles: Statistics and Outline of statistics
Statistics is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of data.[12][13] It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.[12]

A statistician is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a wide number of fields. There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

The word statistics, when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in "Statistics is an art."[14] This should not be confused with the word statistic, referring to a quantity (such as mean or median) calculated from a set of data,[15] whose plural is statistics ("this statistic seems wrong" or "these statistics are misleading").

Systems theory
Main article: Systems theory
Systems theory is the interdisciplinary study of systems in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of systems thinking and a generalization of systems science. The term originates from Ludwig von Bertalanffy's General System Theory (GS) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the action theory of Alcott Parsons and the system-theory of Nickolas McLuhan.

In this context the word systems is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through feedback. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climate.

Theoretical computer science
Main article: Theoretical computer science
Theoretical computer science (TCS) is a division or subset of general computer science and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.

These divisions and subsets include analysis of algorithms and formal semantics of programming languages. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts have their own individual personal leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.
