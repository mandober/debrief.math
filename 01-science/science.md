# Science

Science is the systematic effort of acquiring knowledge - through observation and experimentation coupled with logic and reasoning to find out what can and what cannot be proved - and the knowledge thus acquired.

Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of *testable explanations* and *predictions* about the universe.

An *explanation* is a set of statements usually constructed to describe a set of facts which clarifies the causes, context and consequences of those facts. This description of the facts may establish rules and may clarify the existing rules in relation to any objects or phenomena examined. The components of an explanation can be implicit, and interwoven with one another. An explanation is often underpinned by an understanding or norm that can be represented by different media such as music, text, and graphics. Thus, an explanation is subjected to *interpretation* and *discussion*.

In scientific research, *explanation* is one of several purposes for *empirical research*. Explanation is a way to uncover new knowledge, and to report relationships among different aspects of studied phenomena. Explanation attempts to answer the "why" and "how" questions. Explanations have varied explanatory power. The formal hypothesis is the theoretical tool used to verify explanation in empirical research.

Modern science is a *discovery* as well as an *invention*. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by mathematics; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions.


The word "science" comes from the Latin word *scientia* meaning knowledge.

Modern science respects *objective logical reasoning*, and follows a set of core rules imposed through the research policy in order to comprehend the nature and the laws governing the universe. These principles are known as the scientific method and they consist of 3 rules: repeatability, repeatability and repeatability.

The **scientific method** is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation.

The **scientific method** is the principles and procedures for the systematic pursuit of knowledge involving the recognition and formulation of a problem, the collection of data through observation and experiment, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses.

**Testability**, a property applying to an empirical hypothesis, involves two components:
- The logical property that is variously described as contingency, defeasibility or falsifiability, which means that counterexamples to the hypothesis are logically possible.
- The practical feasibility of observing a reproducible series of such counterexamples if they do exist.
In short, a hypothesis is testable if there is some real hope of deciding whether it is true or false of real experience.

Modern science is divided into 3 branches:
- **Formal sciences**
  - Logic
  - Mathematics
  - Theoretical Computer Science
  - Information Theory
  - Systems Theory
  - Decision Theory
  - Statistics
  - Theoretical Linguistics
- **Natural sciences**
  - Physics
  - Chemistry
  - Biology
- **Social sciences**
  - Economics
  - Psychology
  - Sociology


Natural and social sciences are empirical sciences; the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions. This verifiability may well vary even within a scientific discipline.

The natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics) study the nature, natural phenomena and universal factors in the broadest sense.

The social sciences (economics, psychology, sociology) study individuals and societies.

The formal sciences (logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science) study abstract concepts. There is some disagreement whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science since they are not based on empirical evidence.


Natural, social and formal science make up the **fundamental sciences**, which form the basis of interdisciplinary and applied sciences.

**Applied sciences** are those scientific disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes (engineering, medicine).

**Interdisciplinary sciences** are specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines although thay often possess their own terminologies and expertise.
