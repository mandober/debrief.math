# Mathematical platonism

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/

**Mathematical platonism** (Platonism about mathematics) is the metaphysical view that abstract mathematical objects exist independently of the human mind.

Just as electrons and planets exist independently of the human though, so do numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and planets and their objective properties are rendered true or false by their referants, so are statements about numbers and sets.

>Mathematical truths are therefore discovered, not invented.

The most important argument for the objective existence of abstract mathematical objects derives from *Gottlob Frege* and goes as follows (Frege, 1953): The language of mathematics purports to refer to and quantify over abstract mathematical objects. And a great number of mathematical theorems are true. But a sentence cannot be true unless its subexpressions succeed in doing what they purport to do. Thus, there exist abstract mathematical objects that these expressions refer to and quantify over.

Frege's argument notwithstanding, philosophers have developed a variety of objections to mathematical platonism. Thus, abstract mathematical objects are claimed to be epistemologically inaccessible and metaphysically problematic.

Mathematical platonism has been among the most hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mathematics over the past few decades.

## 1. What is Mathematical Platonism?

Mathematical platonism can be defined as the conjunction of these 3 theses:
- existence: mathematical objects exist
- abstractness: mathematical objects are abstract
- independence: mathematical objects are independent of intelligent agents


## Definitions of Platonism

Dummett, 1978
: Platonism, as a philosophy of mathematics, is founded on a simile: the comparison between the apprehension of mathematical truth to the perception of physical objects, and thus of mathematical reality to the physical universe.

Dummett, 1991
: Platonism is the doctrine that mathematical theories relate to systems of abstract objects, existing independently of us, and that the statements of those theories are determinately true or false independently of our knowledge.

Field, 1989
: A mathematical realist, or platonist, (as I will use these terms) is a person who (a) believes in the existence of mathematical entities (numbers, functions, sets and so forth), and (b) believes them to be mind-independent and language-independent.

GÃ¶del, 1995
: Platonism is the view that mathematics describes a non-sensual reality, which exists independently both of the acts and of the dispositions of the human mind and is only perceived, and probably perceived very incompletely, by the human mind.

Maddy, 1990
: Realism or platonism is the view that mathematics is the scientific study of objectively existing mathematical entities just as physics is the study of physical entities. The statements of mathematics are true or false depending on the properties of those entities, independent of our ability, or lack thereof, to determine which.

Parsons, 1983
: As is customary in discussing the foundations of mathematics, platonism means here not just accepting abstract entities or universals but epistemological or metaphysical realism with respect to them. Thus a platonistic interpretation of a theory of mathematical objects takes the truth or falsity of statements of the theory, in particular statements of existence, to be objectively determined independently of the possibilities of our knowing this truth or falsity.

Shapiro, 1997
: Realism in ontology or platonism is the view that mathematical objects exist independently of mathematicians, and their minds, languages, and so on.

Resnik, 1980
: Let us call an ontological Platonist someone who recognizes the existence of numbers, sets, and the like as being on a par with ordinary objects and who does not attempt to reduce them to physical or subjective mental entities.
