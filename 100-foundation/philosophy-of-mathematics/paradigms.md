Mathematics is an example of the fact that not all of reality is physical reality. Mathematics is part of reality; it is neither derived from it, nor transcendent to it. Mathematics is a compelling discipline that shows clearly that not all knowledge could be obtained by observation of the physical world. Mathematics demonstrates conclusively that physics is incomplete; that it does not cover all of reality or all of knowledge



**Realism** - math objects exist independently of the mind. *Platonism* is atype of realism with ideal forms; but where does our knowledge of these forms come from? *Antirealism* is the opposite view [what?]

**Constructive mathematics** is a school of math that considers constructibility of proofs as the essentil property of proof methods. It demands that a proof is only correct and complete if it is supported by the evidence, that is, if the proof can produce a witness element that has the property in question.

## Dummett's Mathematical Antirealism

Michael Dummett introduced the term *antirealism* as a label for the position adopted by *intuitionists* - Brouwer and Heyting. He introduced it to draw attention to the fact that intuitionists had ideas about mathematics that might be usefully applied to other philosophical issues, so intuitionism could be seen as one type of antirealism, along with, for example, *idealism* (antirealism about physical objects).

Brouwer took the term "intuition" from Kant. Kant thought that our intuitions of space and time are the grounding for any possible experience, and the laws of arithmetic are based on the intuition of time. (So "intuition" is here being used in a technical sense, derived from Kant). Brouwer drew the conclusion that numbers are creations of the human intellect - as we construct mathematical proofs, we are creating *mathematical reality*.

Brouwer introduced these ideas as an alternative to **Logicism**, the view that truths of arithmetic can be derived from logical laws. Frege was the first great champion of logicism, and he thought that logic is based on certain principles, including the principle of bivalence - a meaningful proposition is determinately true or false. For Brouwer, arithmetic is not derived from logic, and so we cannot take the principle of bivalence for granted when engaged in mathematics - rather, we should consider what logical principles follow from mathematical principles. On this basis, Heyting developed the principles of intuitionistic logic. In this logic, to assert P is to assert that there is a proof of P, and to assert Not-P is to assert that there is a proof that no proof of P is possible. We cannot guarantee, for any arbitrary proposition, that there will be either a proof of it, or a proof that no proof is possible, so "P or Not-P" is not an axiom of this system.

Intuitionistic logic can be of interest even to people who are not particularly concerned with the nature of mathematics. It is a system of logic that you would use if you are interested in whether the provability of certain premises implies the provability of the conclusion. So not everybody who studies and uses intuitionistic logic is an anti-realist. Anti-realism was simply the original motivation for developing this system. Also, it should be noted that logicism and intuitionism are not the only two alternatives for understanding the ontology of arithmetic. There are ways of rejecting the reality of numbers without subscribing to the whole intuitionist package.

So, for Dummett, the anti-realist about numbers thinks that statements of arithmetic are true if there is a proof, and false if there is a proof that no proof is possible. Proofs - which are constructed by humans - are the truthmakers for statements of arithmetic. My own view is that truths of arithmetic are necessary truths precisely because they require no truthmakers. That could be called a nihilist or Seinfeldian theory. It isn't realist, but nor is it anti-realist in Dummett's sense. Dummett, of course, did not copyright the term "anti-realism", but there are still many philosophers who associate it with his position.

## Irrationality

-quote from Now: The Physics of Time---

The ancient Greeks believed (that's the right word) that for numbers, only integers existed. They held this truth to be self-evident. They thought that all other numbers could be written as fractions, ratios of integers, such as 22/7. Pythagoras was given credit for discovering that the tones of music are such ratios; an "octave" meant an exact factor of 2 (in the length of a vibrating string). It is called an octave because it spans eight notes. A fifth in music, spanning five notes, came from a string length factor of 3/2. A fourth was a factor of 4/3.

Then a startling thing happened, not only for the history of mathematics, but for the human understanding of reality. The Pythagoreans, about 600 BC discovered that √2 could not be written as a ratio of integers. As a result, they called √2 irrational. Not rational. Crazy.

This may sound like an arcane mathematical matter, but think about it. How could you ever be sure that statement is true? After all, √2 is not a particularly weird number; it is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose arms each have length 1. Physical measurement could not possibly conclude that the number is irrational. You could never try all possible integer combinations. Suppose I told you that √2 = 1,607,521 divided by 1,136,689. It doesn't, but that fraction is very close. Try it; do the division on your calculator and then square it. Or use a spreadsheet.

In discovering the irrational nature of √2, the Pythagoreans took a major step in recognizing the reality of nonphysics knowledge.

At least √2 could be constructed using a straight edge and compass. As I've already said, it is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with unit-length arms. But the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, the number we call pi, could not be so constructed. It turns out to be even stranger than √2; we call it transcendental, as in transcendental meditation.

One even more astonishing fact about the irrationality of-something that shows how extraordinary this fact truly is-is that it was discovered only once in the history of civilization. All other statements of this fact around the world can trace the origin of their knowledge to the work of the Greek mathematicians.



## Dummett and anti-realism

Michael Dummett claims that he invented the word "anti-realism", and I don't think anyone has ever contested that. Even if he didn't in fact invent the word, his definition has been particularly influential, and so if you want to understand how the word is used, it is probably best to begin with Dummett.

Dummett noted that there were a number of philosophical debates that have the same basic structure. A realist (about physical objects) claims that chairs and tables are real, but this is denied by the idealist, who says such objects are merely constructs from sense data. A realist about the mind says that thoughts are real, but this is denied by the behaviourist, who says that when we talk about what people think, we are really talking about how people will behave. A realist about abstract objects, also known as a platonist, claims that numbers are real. This is denied by the intuitionist, who claims that statements about numbers are true only if we have a proof. A realist about the past says that past events really happened, the person who denies this (like O'Brien in Nineteen Eighty-Four) claims that a statement about the past is true only if we have evidence that shows it is true. So, in each of these debates we have someone who is a realist about a certain type of entity and somebody who denies the reality of such entities. Dummett argued that, in these debates, both parties should recognize that what their disagreement is fundamentally a disagreement about the correct logic that should be applied when we use a certain type of language. The realist, in each case, supports the principle of bivalence - statements are determinately true or false. The anti-realist, at least the intelligent anti-realist, supposes that a statement is true if we have the right kind of evidence or proof, and false if we have the right kind of evidence against it, or a disproof. But since there is no guarantee that for every statement we will have either a proof (or the right kind of evidence for it) or a disproof (or the right kind of evidence against it), we cannot affirm the principle of bivalence to be a necessary truth for statements of that class. The realist holds that it is perfectly possible that a statement could be true, even though we have no evidence to show that it is true, or indeed false even though we have no evidence against it. Therefore the realist affirms, and the anti-realist denies, the possibility of evidence-transcendent truth.

  For example, for the realist about the past it makes perfect sense to suppose that I could kill someone, then eliminate absolutely every piece of evidence about the killing, including erasing my own memory of the killing. I would still have killed the person, even though there is no evidence that I did so. For the anti-realist, if I eliminate all the evidence, then it is no longer true that I killed the person. According to the realist, it is either true that Aristotle ate figs on the day that he died, or it is not true that he ate figs on the day that he died. We don't have any evidence to tell us which of those statements is true, but we know that it must be the case that one of them is true and the other false.

Dummett held that it was possible to be an anti-realist about one type of statement and a realist about another type. I could deny the existence of numbers, but affirm the existence of minds. So for Dummett, a philosopher is not simply an anti-realist, a philosopher is an anti-realist about a particular subject matter. The position that anti-realism is the correct answer in all the debates is termed *"global anti-realism"* by Dummett, and he thought that global anti-realism was a particularly problematic position, arguably incoherent.

Anti-realism beyond Dummett

As will be clear to anyone who read the previous section, Dummett had a whole theory about what is at issue in a whole set of philosophical debates and how such debates should be resolved. He was particularly interested in *philosophy of mathematics*. When he talks about what is at stake in the debate between realists and antirealists about mathematics he is basically imagining an argument between *Gottlob Frege*, on the one hand, (the realist), and *Brouwer and Heyting* on the other hand (the anti-realists). He is imagining what Brouwer would have said if he had studied Frege's work carefully, and so on.

However, there are philosophers who have approached these issues without making use of Dummett's paradigm. For example, Hartry Field rejects any form of realism about numbers, proposing a fictionalist theory. Since Field is certainly not a realist about numbers, his fictionalism might be described as a form of anti-realism. But Field's fictionalism is clearly quite different from Dummett's form of anti-realism about numbers, and Dummett was quite critical of Field's theory.

Dummett said that his distinction between realism and anti-realism was not meant to apply to debates about moral realism, which he considered to be more fundamental. This, incidentally, is why Wiggins and McDowell write about moral cognitivism rather than moral realism, to avoid any confusion between the issues they were debating and the issues that Dummett was debating. However, I've no doubt that one can find philosophers who talk about moral anti-realism rather than moral non-cognitivism.

So, if one sticks to Dummett's definition, the term "anti-realism" has a very precise meaning, but Dummett did not copyright the term, and it is often used in ways only vaguely related to the sense that he intended to give it.

## Mathematical irrealism

Mathematical irrealism is the view that mathematical entities or concepts, such as numbers and sets, do not exist in reality, instead, they are seen as mental constructs or creations of the human mind.

This is in contrast to *mathematical realism*, which is the view that mathematical entities and concepts exist in reality and are not simply a product of human thought.

There is no consensus among philosophers or mathematicians on the question of mathematical realism versus irrealism, and both views have their proponents and detractors.

## Mathematical truth

https://www.quora.com/Is-mathematics-an-absolute-truth-What-are-some-arguments-to-defend-that-mathematics-is-or-isn%E2%80%99t-an-absolute-truth

Mathematics is absolute truth only to the extent that the axioms allow it to be absolutely true, and we can never know if the axioms themselves are true, because unlike theorems which can be proved using previous theorems or axioms, axioms rest on the validity of human observation.

If that sounds too abstract, let me provide a historical example. Up until the 19th century, geometry rested largely on the 10 axioms of Euclid. These axioms were generally assumed to be true, being self-evident to common sense. Of particular interest was the fifth axiom, which stated that two lines which are perpendicular to the same line are parallel to each other. This, too, seems somewhat obvious to common sense, and since Euclid couldn't prove it using any other axioms or theorems, he included it in the list of axioms. Things seemed fine until the 19th century when two European mathematicians working independently (János Bolyai and Nikolai Lobachevsky; and three if you count Gauss who had also discovered the same result independently but didn't publish it) uncovered a contradiction of the fifth axiom: On a sphere, such as the earth, two lines (longitudes) which are perpendicular to the same line (the equator) end up intersecting at the north and the south poles -- violating Euclid's fifth axiom!

This shook the foundations of geometry and had mathematicians running for their money. In fact, it even gave birth to a whole new branch of mathematics that forms a critical core of modern mathematics and physics, and without which the theory of relativity would be impossible: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry

Several mathematicians like David Hilbert even attempted to provide new axiomatic system to found geometry on. But of course, we couldn't be sure that these axioms are true under every circumstance either. Read: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms

So there, as long as the axiomatic systems are based on human observation, mathematics can be said to be un-absolute to a certain extent, if not as much as natural sciences.

## Formalism vs logicism

They are actually radically different programmes in many respects. To help understand the differences, it might help to briefly get to grips with why either programme exists in the first place.

At the turn of the last century, there was a bit of a crisis in mathematics. Paradoxes were abound, and mathematicians helped themselves willynilly to assumptions from all over the place. There was insufficient rigour to ensure that proofs did their job. You could say, there was a foundational crisis. Mathematicians and philosophers were desperate to pin down some kind of foundation to keep mathematics secure, and to help guarantee that they could begin to trust in their proofs once again.

This all sounds quite dramatic, and it really was. There is a lovely transcript from a talk to be found here: http://web.stanford.edu/~ebwarner/SplashTalk.pdf

All this drama was a direct cause of the introduction of the "big three" - intuitionism, logicism and finitism. But each took a very different approach to dealing with the issues. They shared a common goal, but each diagnosed the problem differently, and each went about resolving the issue in a very different way. That they are clumped together should not mislead you into thinking that they are otherwise similar.

Logicism

Is a reductionist programme. Logic was seen to have certain properties Frege rather wanted for mathematics. It is necessary - that is, the logical laws are necessarily true. It is (arguably) analytic and a priori, with a a fixed, certain epistemology. And it is rigorous, with the potential for clearly defined, simple rules and axioms from which you can build the whole system.

As such, if maths is reducible to logic, then mathematics can be shown to have all of these properties. And, moreover mathematicians can then follow the rules of logic and thereby construct proofs without fear of screwing up, and even moreover problematic concepts like those of "function" can be worked out and defined within this system. To be honest, Logicism is a bit of a misnomer, as it fails to capture the complex work in metaphysics that underpins Frege's reductionism.

His programme was thus to:

outline the background philosophy underpinning logic (so define concepts, functions and the like)
show how mathematics can be reduced to simple, basic logical principles.
So he would go about defining the concept of number, showing how he can reduce it to logical, analytical rules and structures. Regretfully, this would rely on the now infamous Basic Law Five. He inadvertently helped himself to chunks of set theory, and in so doing, helped himself to Russell's paradox. His appendix in which he discusses the paradox, which he was informed of by Russell just prior to publication, is paradigmatic of intellectual integrety and honesty.

Formalism

Formalism is a bit harder to pin down, as there is no equivalent of Frege - there are a few finitisms, of which Hilbert (who is often treated as central) is just one. But everso roughly, formalism is an attempt to reduce mathematics to sets of rules for the manipulation of collections of symbols. You take an axiom - which is just a collection of signs, and then follow certain rules to move from one string to the next.

This sounds like Logicism but is in fact very different. Logics are complex entities in their own right - with both a syntax and a semantics. They have axioms and rules too, but also interpretations. You could be a formalist about Logic. But Frege certainly wasn't, as his inadvertent use of set theory shows. For the Logicist, mathematics is reduced to Logic, but Logic is more than just a formal game.

For the formalist, mathematics isn't logic. Mathematics is the manipulation of strings following certain rules. It can be thought of like a game to be played, with the main difference being the goal and the context - the goal being to address mathematical issues and find certain desirable strings through the following of those rules.

Like I said, I'm keeping it broad - each finitism will have it's own way of saying the above, and the details are very important. Hilbert's programme, for example, went along the following lines, excellently put by Richard Zach the SEP:

These objects were, for Hilbert, signs. The domain of contentual number theory consists in the finitary numerals, i.e., sequences of strokes. These have no meaning, i.e., they do not stand for abstract objects, but they can be operated on (e.g., concatenated) and compared. Knowledge of their properties and relations is intuitive and unmediated by logical inference. Contentual number theory developed this way is secure, according to Hilbert: no contradictions can arise simply because there is no logical structure in the propositions of contentual number theory.


Hilbert's Program

The signs - whatever they are (Hilbert was very unclear) are immediately and easily manipulated. So the manipulation of signs in this account is profoundly non-logical.

But he needed to go beyond this, to get the whole of mathematics under his belt, and safely stowed away without fear of contradiction. He needed to, for example, prove that using the universal operator was okay. He needed to prove that a formalist account was consistent and complete. His programme thus began with proofs of finite mathematics, showing that the inventory of formulas generatable in mathematics was going to be safely consistent. And later, the goal was to show it to be complete.

But most problematic and uncertain were the infinitary aspects of mathematics. How could he deal with those and get the certainty and rigour so desired?

Nonetheless they are, or can be useful, if the ideal sector conservatively extends the finitary, that is if no proof from finitary premisses to a finitary conclusion which takes a detour through the infinitary language yields a conclusion we could not have reached, albeit perhaps (herein lies the utility) by a longer, more unwieldy proof.

Formalism in the Philosophy of Mathematics

Basically, feel free to go transfinite, but only if it doesn't get you anything extra. Transfinite shortcuts are fine, but only if they're really shortcuts, getting you to where you were already going.

Now Hilbert only had to prove that these contentless, but useful parts of mathematics were safe and useful: they needed to be consistent and complete. Godel's second incompleteness theorem put paid to that idea.

Today, the boundaries between the two seem a bit harder to identify. Hilbert's work led directly to contemporary metamathematics and proof theory. Both are important parts of logical investigation, and logics contain proof theories in their own right. But remember that while these terms are confusing, and the motivation historically behind both was similar, the two are very different. They have different philosophical underpinnings: Frege, for instance has an abstract ontology - Formalism has a debatable ontology of "signs" and manipulation rules. One thinks that Logic is distinct from mathematics, the other thinks mathematics is just logic.

It's all a bit headache inducing, and a significant part of that is the fact that isms - which I loathe - are so commonplace. If you keep struggling, instead of trying to characterise an ism off the bat, look at an example found in each ism. Read some commentaries of Hilbert - a paradigmatic formalist - and read some Frege and some commentaries. Then start to generalise from there. Isms are a guideline, and you'll find they often just confuse the issues more than help them.
