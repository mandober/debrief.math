# The Foundation of Mathematics

The foundation of mathematics, like the foundation of any other theory, deals with the foundational questions:
- What objects are the subject of mathematical study?
- What objects are the most fundamental (primitive) objects of mathematics? So they can be used the most basic building blocks of mathematics?
- What are the most basic properties of objects under mathematical study? Such properties usually have the form of axioms (laws, principles).
- How are more complex objects build from the primitive ones?
- How are other properties derived from the primitive properties?


*Unification of mathematical body of knowledge* is one of the goals of mathematics, and, more generally, of all sciences. An important aspect of unification is identifying the most primitive objects central to the theory.

Some theories have identified their core object and placed it right in their name, never to be forgotten: set theory, order theory, graph theory, group theory, number theory, proof theory, type theory, probability theory, computation theory, category theory, etc.

However, when we zoom out from these individual mathematical theories to take on a larger perspective and try to establish the central objects of the more general theories like that of physics or mathematics itself, things get tricky. In fact, category theory is one which takes this all-encompassing view of mathematics trying to establish relations between the individual math theories as well as to form a higher-order, universal language of mathematics. The lower-order (assembly) language of mathematics seems to still be anchored in set theory despite its lacking in its role as a fundamental theory in the math disciplines like topology.


In *physics*, the most fundamental object needs to model the most fundamental phenomena of nature. However, for thousands of years and still today, we keep failing to find one.

The philosophers of the ancient Greece have come up with the name *"atom" for the fundamental object of nature* they could only hypothesize about. 

It was only in the recent times that the concept of atom finally found the appropriate objects in nature it wouldn't mind being associated with. 

However, atom as the elementary particle didn't stand for a long time and relatively quickly the object it was composed of were identified. Today we have a zoo consisting of the 17 elementary particles (6 quarks, 6 leptons, 5 bosons) arranged in *the standard model* that undelines "The Theory of (almost) Everything" (gravity proves elusive still) as we work towards the full coverage.

**The Standard Model** (SM) of particle physics is the theory describing 3 of the 4 fundamental forces in the universe (electromagnetic force, weak and strong interactions, with gravity remaining elusive), as well as classifying all known elementary particles. The SM was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world. The current formulation was finalized in the mid-1970s, after the existence of quarks was experimentally confirmed. Since then, confirmation of the *top quark* (1995), the *tau neutrino* (2000), and the *Higgs boson* (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. To its further credit, the SM has also accurately predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the `W` and `Z` bosons.
