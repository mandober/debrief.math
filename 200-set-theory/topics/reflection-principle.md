# Reflection principle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_principle

In set theory, the reflection principle says that it is possible to find sets that resemble the class of all sets. There are several different forms of the reflection principle depending on exactly what is meant by "resemble". Weak forms of the reflection principle are theorems of ZF set theory due to Montague (1961), while stronger forms can be new and very powerful axioms for set theory. The name "reflection principle" comes from the fact that properties of the universe of all sets are "reflected" down to a smaller set.
