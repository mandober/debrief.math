# Cardinality of the continuum

* the cardinality of ‚Ñï is denoted by `‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ` (aleph naught)
* the cardinality of ‚Ñù is denoted by `ùñà` *cardinality of the continuum*
* Cantor showed using *diagonal argument* that `ùñà > ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`
* **The continuum hypothesis** claims that `‚Ñµ‚ÇÅ = 2 ‚Üë ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`
* `2 ‚Üë ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ` is the smallest cardinal number bigger than `‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ`
* so, there is no set whose cardinality is between that of ‚Ñ§ and ‚Ñù
* `ùñà` = `2 ‚Üë ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ` = `‚Ñµ‚ÇÅ` i.e. `ùñà` has the same cardinality as ùìü(‚Ñï)

* The continuum hypothesis is independent of ZFC; it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent).


## Cardinality of infinity

In order to figure out the cardinality of some (possibly infinite) set, we try to find a one-to-one correspondance between that set and the set of natural numbers - such a set is enumerable if the correspondance exists.


To count a set $$S$$ is to establish a bijection function between the set $$S$$ and an initial segment $$\mathbb{N_n}$$ of the set of natural numbers, $$\mathbb{N}$$; the initial segment of the set of natural numbers (excluding zero) is denoted by $$N_n$$.

If $$S\simeq \mathbb{N_n}$$, then a set $$S$$ is **countable finite** and it has $$n$$ elements. If $$S\simeq \mathbb{N}$$, then a set $$S$$ is **countably infinite**.

Between 1874 and 1897, Cantor was the first to work on the task of finding a one-to-one correspondence between number infinite sets (integers, rationals, reals, etc.) and the set of natural numbers. Infinite sets that have this bijection function are countable infinite sets, those that don't (like the set of real numbers) are called **uncountable infinite sets**.

For example, the set of squares of natural numbers can be placed in a 1-1 correspondance with the set of natural numbers themselves:

$$
1 \quad 2\quad 3\quad \dots\quad n \\
1 \quad 4\quad 9\quad \dots\quad n^2
$$

> Infinite set is enumerable (denumerable, countable) if it can be placed in a one-to-one correspondance with the set of natural numbers.

To show that a set is enumerable we present a bijection function that indicates how its members, without repetitions, can be placed in an "infinite" list. That way the first element of an infinite set will be at position 1, the second at position 2, etc; each element will have its **index**.

The set of integers can be enumerated by listing them in the following order:

$$0,\ 1, -1,\ 2, -2,\ \dots$$.

Also enumerable is the set of rational numbers. The way to enumerate rationals is fairly complex (criss-cross path in a matrix), so here is the starting sequance of the positive rationals only:

$$1, 2 ,\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, 3, 4, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, 5, 6, \frac{5}{2}, \frac{4}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{5}{3}, 7, 8, \frac{7}{2}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{7}{3}, 9, \dots$$

```
1/1   1/2 ‚Üí 1/3   1/4 ‚Üí 1/5 ...
 ‚Üì  ‚Üó     ‚Üô     ‚Üó     ‚Üô
2/1   2/2   2/3   2/4 ...
    ‚Üô     ‚Üó     ‚Üô
3/1   3/2   3/3 ...
 ‚Üì  ‚Üó     ‚Üô
4/1   4/2 ...
...
```


## Countable set

Georg Cantor introduced the term countable set, contrasting sets that are countable with those that are uncountable. Today, countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called discrete mathematics.

> A countable set is a set with the same cardinality as some subset of the set of natural numbers.

A countable set is either countably finite or countably infinite set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number.

A set $$S$$ is **countable** if there exists an injective function $$f$$ from $$S$$ to the set of natural numbers, $$\mathbb N$$.

If such injective function is also surjective (and thus bijective), then the set $$S$$ is called **countably infinite**.

> A set is countably infinite if it has one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.


## Comparing sets

While the cardinality of a finite set is just the count of its elements, extending this notion to infinite sets starts by defining the notion of comparison between arbitrary, possibly infinite, sets.

$$|A| = |B|$$    
Two sets $$A$$ and $$B$$ have the same cardinality if there's a bijection from $$A$$ to $$B$$. Such sets are **equivalent** (equinumerous, equipotent, equipollent), denoted by $$A \simeq B$$ (or $$A \sim B$$ or $$A \approx B$$).

$$|A| \le |B|$$   
Cardinality of $$A$$ has cardinality less than or equal to $$B$$ if there's an injective function from $$A$$ into $$B$$.

$$|A| \lt |B|$$    
Cardinality of $$A$$ is strictly less than $$B$$ if there's an injective (but no bijective) function, from $$A$$ to $$B$$.

**Schr√∂der-Bernstein theorem**    
If $$|A| \le |B|$$ and $$|B| \le |A|$$ then $$|A| = |B|$$

The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that $$|A| \le |B|$$ and $$|B| \le |A|$$ for every $$A, B$$.
