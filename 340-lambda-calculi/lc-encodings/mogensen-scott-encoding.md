# Mogensen-Scott encoding

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogensen-Scott_encoding

An encoding is a comprehensive way how to represent data types in the lambda calculus. The data and operators form an embedable mathematical structure. The Church encoding starts with representations of the basic data types and then builds up on that, while the *Scott encoding* starts from the simplest method to compose algebraic data types.

**Scott encoding** is a way to represent, possibly recursive, data types in the lambda calculus.

*Mogensen-Scott encoding* (MSE) extends and slightly modifies Scott encoding by applying the encoding to meta-programming. MSE allows the representation of lambda calculus terms, as data, to be operated on by a meta program.
