# Original lambda calculus

The original **lambda calculus** was invented by Alonzo Church in the 1930's (Church, 1933).

Church's aim was to use lambda calculus as a foundation for a formal theory of mathematics, in order to establish which functions are computable by means of an algorithm.

Î»-calculus formalizes the basic aspects of mathematical functions, particularly their construction, application and evaluation.
