# Functions

In mathematics, functions are a concept with very special properties. Spawned from set theory (or, at least, formalized in set theory), a function is a special kind of relation between two sets. Being a relation, a function also relates two sets, a domain and a codomain, and like all relations, it is itself a set of ordered pairs, with the first component of a pair coming from the source set, while the second component mut come from the target set. 

More precisely, a function associates each element in a domain set to exactly one element in a codomain.

This constraint is what promotes a relation to a function. In fact, there are two restrictions here: 1) all elements of a domain must be associated 2) each to exactly one element of a codomain.

Since, not all codomain elements may be included in an association, those that are form a subset of a codomain called range. And because of that, a function's definition must mention both domain and codomain, although the domain set may be derived from the function set itself - it is the set formed by taking all the first components of all the ordered pairs.

In math, a function has two "faces": a function definition and function application. First, a function needs to be defined and in mathematical notation this looks like `f(x) = x + 1`. A function definition is also called function abstraction. The other face is function application, e.g. `f(3)`, where the previously defined function bound to a variable (identifier) `f` is applied to an argument, `3` in this case.
