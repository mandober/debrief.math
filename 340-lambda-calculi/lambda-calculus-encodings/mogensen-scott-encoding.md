# Mogensen-Scott encoding

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogensen-Scott_encoding

*Scott encoding* is a way to represent recursive data types in the LC. In an encoding, the data and operators form a mathematical structure which is embedded in the LC.

Whereas *Church encoding* starts with representations of the basic data types, and builds up from it, Scott encoding starts from the simplest method to compose algebraic data types (ADT).

*Mogensen-Scott encoding* extends and slightly modifies Scott encoding by applying the encoding to meta-programming. This encoding allows the representation of LC terms, as data, to be operated on by a meta program.
