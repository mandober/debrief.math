# λ calculus

Lambda calculus (or λ-calculus) is both a generic name for a whole range of different formal systems, as well as the name for the untyped version of Church's lambda calculus, also called *untyped lambda calculus*.

In fact, ambiguity may still arise since Church had initially went through different designs, all under the same name, lambda calculus. Some sources use the term `λI calculus` as the name for one the early versions which forbade dropping formal parameters.

Later, more advanced variants of LC had names derived from the universal `λI calculus` form, inserting various symbols after the letter lambda, e.g. `λ→` is the simply typed lambda calculus, `λω` is a polymorphic lambda calculus, etc.
