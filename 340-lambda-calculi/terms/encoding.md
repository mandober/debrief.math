# Lambda calculus encodings

## Notation

Backslash is used for lambda:

* easier to type
* familiar from Haskell

Neighbouring lambdas can be combined with one backslash:

    \a b s z . a s (b s z)

Corresponds to:

    位a. 位b. 位s. 位z. a s (b s z)


## Church and Scott encodings

* encode data as lambda terms
* continuation passing style
* Church folds vs Scott case analysis


## Continuation passing style

* the datum is a black box that knows itself
* the datum is passed functions that it calls with its deconstruction
* the datum has one argument per constructor
* each continuation has one argument per constructor argument


## Simple types

Church and Scott encoding coincide for simple types.


## Bool

Haskell:

    data Bool
      = False
      | True

Church, Scott:

    true  = \t f . t
    false = \t f . f

    and = \a b . a b a
    or  = \a b . a a b
    not = \a . a false true

The datum "true" takes two arguments, and returns the first, which (by
convention) denotes the value True.


## Pair

Haskell:

    data Pair a b
      = Pair a b

Church, Scott:

    pair = \a b p . p a b

    fst  = \p . p (\a b . a)
    snd  = \p . p (\a b . b)

The datum "pair x y" takes one argument, which is a function of two arguments,
and passes it the stored values of "x" and "y".


## Maybe

Haskell:

    data Maybe a
      = Nothing
      | Just a

Church, Scott:

    nothing = \n j . n
    just    = \a n j . j a

    maybe   = \n j m . m n j


## Either

Haskell:

    data Either a b
      = Left a
      | Right b

Church, Scott:

    left   = \a l r . l a
    right  = \b l r . r b

    either = \l r e . e l r


## Recursive types

* Church and Scott encoding differ for recursive types.

* Church encoding uses folds.

    The deconstruction continuation threads throughout
    the structure.

* Scott encoding is similar to case analysis.

    The deconstruction continuation
    unwraps one layer of constructors only.


## Natural numbers

Haskell:

    data Nat
      = Zero
      | Succ Nat
  
Church:

    zero = \s z . z
    succ = \n s z . s (n s z)
  
Scott:

    zero = \s z . z
    succ = \n s z . s n


## Nat examples

Haskell:

    Zero, Succ Zero, Succ(Succ Zero), Succ(Succ(Succ Zero))

Church, applying the same "s" "n" times at once:

    \s z . z
    \s z . s z
    \s z . s (s z)
    \s z . s (s (s z))

Scott, applying different "s" "n" times separately:

    \s z . z
    \s z . s (\s z . z)
    \s z . s (\s z . s (\s z . z))
    \s z . s (\s z . s (\s z . s (\s z . z)))


## Church Nat succ

    zero = \s z . z
    succ = \n s z . s (n s z)

      succ zero
    = {- definition of succ -}
      (\n s z . s (n s z)) zero
    = {- beta -}
      \s z . s (zero s z)
    = {- definition of zero -}
      \s z . s ((\s z . z) s z)
    = {- beta -}
      \s z . s ((\z . z) z)
    = {- beta -}
      \s z . s z
    = {- definition of one -}
      one


## Scott Nat succ

    zero = \s z . z
    succ = \n s z . s n

      succ zero
    = {- definition of succ -}
      (\n s z . s n) zero
    = {- beta -}
      \s z . s zero
    = {- definition of zero -}
      \s z . s (\s z . z)
    = {- definition of one -}
      one


## Nat arithmetic

Church:

    add = \m n . m succ n
    mul = \m n . m (add n) zero
    exp = \m n . n m

Scott, open terms with `letrec`:

    add = \m n . m (\p . succ  (add p n)) n
    mul = \m n . m (\p . add n (mul p n)) zero
    exp = \m n . n (\p . mul m (exp m p)) one

Scott, closed terms with `fix`:

    add = fix (\add . \m n . m (\p . succ  (add p n)) n)
    mul = fix (\mul . \m n . m (\p . add n (mul p n)) zero)
    exp = fix (\exp . \m n . n (\p . mul m (exp m p)) one)


## Fixed point combinator

Semantics:

    fix f = f (fix f)

Implementation:

    \f . (\x . f (x x)) (\x . f (x x))

What it computes:

* The unique least fixed point under the definedness order.

* Allows recursive functions to be defined as closed terms.


## Nat predecessor

Church (courtesy Wikipedia):

    pred = \n f x . n (\g h . h (g f)) (\u . x) (\v . v)

Scott:

    pred = \n . n (\p . p) zero


## Nat conversion

Church arithmetic is more concise (and doesn't need `fix`).

Scott predecessor is comprehensible.

Mix and match?

    churchToScott = \n . n scottSucc scottZero

    scottToChurch = \n . n
        (\p . churchSucc (scottToChurch p))
        churchZero

    scottToChurch = fix (\scottToChurch . \n . n
        (\p . churchSucc (scottToChurch p))
        churchZero)


## Nat subtract and equality

Church:

    sub = \m n . n pred m

Scott:

    sub = \m n . m
      (\p . n (\q . sub p q) m)
      zero
    equal = \m n . m
      (\p . n (\q . equal p q) false)
      (n (\q . false) true)

Unwrap a layer of constructor from each number and recurse.

There is a different `equal` for booleans:

    equalBool = \a b . a b (not b)


## List

Haskell:

    data List a
      = Nil
      | Cons a (List a)

Church:

    nil  = \c n . n
    cons = \x xs c n . c x (xs c n)

Scott:

    nil  = \c n . n
    cons = \x xs c n . c x xs


## List operations

Church, Scott:

    isnil  = \l . l (\x xs . false) true
    head   = \l . l (\x xs . x) error

Church (`tail` courtesy Wikipedia):

    length = \l . l (\x xs . succ xs) zero
    tail   = \l c n . l
        (\x xs g . g x (xs c)) (\xs . n) (\x xs . xs)

Scott:

    length = \l . l (\x xs . succ (length xs)) zero
    tail   = \l . l (\x xs . xs) nil


## More Scott functions

    compose = \f g x . f (g x)

    fold = \f e l . l (\x xs . f x (fold f e xs)) e

    sum  = fold add zero
    ands = fold and true
    ors  = fold or false

    map = \f . fold (compose cons f) nil
    all = \f . compose ands (map f)
    any = \f . compose ors (map f)

    take = \n l. n(\p. l (\x xs. cons x (take p xs))nil)nil
    drop = \n l. n(\p. l (\x xs. drop p xs) nil) l

    iterate = \f x . cons x (iterate f (f x))


# How to perform lambda calculus


## How to perform lambda calculus

* single step graph reduction

* visualisation of current state

* sonification of changes in state

* open terms vs closed terms


## Graph reduction

    data Term
      = Free String
      | Reference Integer
      | Bound          -- de Bruijn index 0
      | Scope Term     -- see Lambdascope paper
      | Lambda Strategy Term
      | Apply Term Term

    reduce
      :: Definitions   -- Map String  Term
      -> References    -- Map Integer Term
      -> Term
      -> Maybe (References, Term)


## Three kinds of Lambda

* strict (syntax inspired by Haskell's -XBangPatterns):

        (\v ! s) t

    t is fully reduced before substitution into s.

* copy:

        (\v ? s) t

    t is substituted for each occurrence of v in s.

* lazy:

        (\v . s) t

    a new `Reference` is created for t, and substituted into s.

    `reduce` reduces *inside* the `References` until it is irreducible, at which
    point the `Reference` is replaced with the `Term` it refers to.


## Visualisation

![](visualisation.png){width=100%}\ 

## Sonification

* count number of nodes of each type

* statistics are forwarded to a Pure-data patch

* changes in each count control a harmonic (one for each type of node) in a
  simple phase modulation synth


## Open terms

* free variables looked up on demand from environment

* allows definitions to be changed at runtime

* easier to write


## Drawbacks of open terms

* no sharing

    subterms can be evaluated many times due to duplication

* exponential work (worst case)

* exponential space (worst case)


## Fixed points

* closed terms with fixed point combinators

* allows evaluation to be shared

* sharing can be vital for efficiency


# Future work


## Better Evaluator

* current evaluator is still somewhat ad-hoc and doesn't preserve sharing

* previous evaluator even had correctness bugs

* switch to using Lambdascope (or similar) as a library?


## Auto Fix

Automatically translating open terms to use fixed point combinators:

* recursive functions can use `fix`
* mutually recursive functions can use `fix` combined with tuples

        many = some `orElse` none
        some = one `andThen` many

    becomes:

        manysome = fix (\p -> pair
            (snd p `orElse` none)
            (one `andThen` fst p) )
        many = fst manysome
        some = snd manysome


## Magic It

* refer to previously evaluated terms
* including the currently evaluating term
* without restarting evaluation

Haskell example (`ghci-8.0.1`):

    > 3
    3
    > it + 5
    8
    > it * 2
    16


## Further Performances / Project Ideas

* "An infinite deal of nothing", a variety of non-terminating loops each with
  their own intrinsic computational rhythm.

* Implement in untyped lambda calculus an interpreter for a known
  Turing-complete tape mutation based language and run some simple programs
  in it.

    Illustrates Turing-completeness of untyped lambda calculus, albeit slowly.
