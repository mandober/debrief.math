# Lambda calculus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus

Lambda calculus is a formal mathematical system and a notation for exploring mathematical functions. It is based on function abstraction and application.

Lambda calculus was invented by Alonzo Church 

Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.

Lambda calculus is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine.

Lambda calculus was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics.

Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them.

In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:
