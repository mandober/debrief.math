## Fermat's Last Theorem

Fermat's Last Theorem states the absence of non-trivial integer solutions to the equation:

$$x^n + y^n = z^n$$

Namely, it seemed there are no integer solutions except for the trivial ones that set $$n$$ to 1

This is easily stated but 
has proved to be one of the most vexing problems in the whole history 
of mathematics.

and the search for a proof led to the development of whole 
new branches of mathematics, but it was only in the last decade of the 
20th century that Andrew Wiles finally completed the task.
