# Totality

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totality


If combining any two elements of the set gives an element that is also a member of that set, we say that the binary operation ("star", `*`) closes over the set.

$$(\forall x,y \in A) \to (x \star y \in A)$$

A binary operation, `*`, that combines any two elements of the set `A` must give a result that is also in `A`.

For example, addition is closed over the natural numbers, but division is not.
