# Run of the mouth

Math, like all other human effort engaged in obtaining insights, then knowledge, about a structure, uses analysis to decompose a structure into its constituent atomic parts that are divisible no further. Then we can have it easier in trying to investigate and grasp what each individual part contributes to the totality.

This analytical-synthetical way of understanding is the only method we humans have at our disposal. Apart from (possibly?) a few rare individuals that can "take in" a very complex object in its entirety and immediately intuitively understand it, the rest of us have to work hard when dealing with a complex structure.

From a very young age, we show keen interest in applying and ever improving our analytical skills. We show increased enthusiasm particularly when we're intrigued by a physical objects of strange and intricate complexity, which we possibly experience as beauty. But the beauty must die so the mystery can be revealed, we excuse our younger self many years later, continuing to recollect how this concrete and "hands on" analytical approach brought much gratification, even if we didn't initially respect the distinction between destructuring and destruction.

I've sure adored that toy truck and loved to play with it but I've loved the process of analyzing it away into bits even more. The accompanying phase, the synthesis, was only an afterthought then.
