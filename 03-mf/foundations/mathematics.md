Mathematics developed through the use of abstraction and logical reasoning.

Mathematicians investigate new concepts trying to formulate conjectures (still not dis/proven theorem) and establish their truth by rigorous deduction from a set of fundamental axioms and previously defined theorems within a certain formal system.



The word "mathematics" has origins in ancient Greek `μάθημα` |máthēma| (knowledge, study, learning).
