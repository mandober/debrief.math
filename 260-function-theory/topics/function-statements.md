# Functional statements

- function is a set
- function is a set the elements of which are ordered pairs
- function is a relation
- function is a binary relation that is functional and serial
- function is a binary relation that is right-unique and left-total
- function (relation) between two sets is an element of their dot product
- identity function is a mapping from a set back to itself
- identity function is identical to the reflexive closure


## misc/unsorted

- a relation that is functional means exactly that the relation is a function
- A relation that is injective and functional is precisely an injective function on its domain. It is a bijection of its domain with its range.
- relation need not be total; functions must be total (for now)
- R is a function X -> Y if for each x ∈ X, there is exactly one y ∈ Y such that xRy
- R is a bijection between X and Y if R and its inverse are both functions
