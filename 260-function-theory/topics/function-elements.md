# Elements of a function

A function, `f`, is 
a *functional* and *serial* **relation** 
that relates two sets A and B 
(which may be the same set).

The *source set*, `A`, is called the **domain** and 
the *target set*, `B`, is called the **codomain**.

A function `f` that associates 
*each element* of the domain `A` 
to a *unique element* of the codomain B 
may be specified by a **type signature**: 
`f : A -> B` 
which may be read 
"function f (goes) from A to B".

A function's *signature*
unambiguously specifies its domain and codomain, 
clearly indicating the domain 
over which the input variable ranges, 
as well as the codomain 
over which the output variable ranges 
(both indicate the domain of discurse).

In fact, the domain of a function may be derived 
from the set of a function by extracting 
the first components from all the ordered pairs, 
collecting them in a set 
(must be equal to the domain).
The set that is obtain by gathering together 
all the second components of the ord pairs 
is called **range**. 

Functions are usually modelled as unary 
taking and returning only one value.
