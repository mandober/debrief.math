# Codomain

The codomain of a function
, or the target set, 
is the set into which 
all of the output of the function 
is constrained to fall.

It is the set Y in the notation f: X → Y. 

The term range is sometimes ambiguously used to refer to either the codomain or image of a function.

A codomain is part of a function f if f is defined as a triple (X, Y, G) where X is called the domain of f, Y its codomain, and G its graph.

The set of all elements of the form f(x), where x ranges over the elements of the domain X, is called the image of f. The image of a function is a subset of its codomain so it might not coincide with it. Namely, a function that is not surjective has elements y in its codomain for which the equation f(x) = y does not have a solution.

A codomain is not part of a function f if f is defined as just a graph.
For example in set theory it is desirable to permit the domain of a function to be a proper class X, in which case there is formally no such thing as a triple (X, Y, G). With such a definition functions do not have a codomain, although some authors still use it informally after introducing a function in the form f: X → Y.

A codomain of a function is the target set in operations or relations on two sets.

Given two sets `A` and `B`, where `∀a ∈ A` and `∀b ∈ B`, set `B` is the codomain:
- in set operations (union, intersection, etc.), e.g. `A U B = {a ∨ b}`
- in the dot product, `A x B = {(a,b)}`
- in relations on sets, `aRb` i.e. `{(a,b)} = R ⊆ A x B`
- in functions, `f :: A -> B` and `f = {(a,b)}`

The codomain set is sometimes denoted by $$B_{cod}$$.
