* Simple Laws about Nonprominent Properties of Binary Relations

Abstract
We checked each binary relation on a 5-element set for a given set of properties, including
usual ones like asymmetry and less known ones like Euclideanness. Using a poor man's
Quine-McCluskey algorithm, we computed prime implicants of non-occurring property
combinations, like "not irreflexive, but asymmetric". We considered the laws obtained
this way, and manually proved them true for binary relations on arbitrary sets, thus
contributing to the encyclopedic knowledge about less known properties.
