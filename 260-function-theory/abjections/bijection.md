# Bijective function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_function

A bijective function is a function that is both injective and surjective. This means that a bijective function imposes equinumerosity between its domain, codomain and range.

> bijection: domain === range === codomain

That's why another name for a bijective function is a *one-to-one correspondence* (it should not be confused with the term "one-to-one function" that refers to an injective function).

Bijective functions are also referred to as *bijections* (this term is not exclusive to functions).

correspondence that refers to bijective functions, which are functions such that each element in the codomain is an image of exactly one element in the domain.



A mapping that is both injective and surjective is bijective. More precisely, a mapping that is first injection, then surjection, is a bijection. That's because surjection has a good and a bad property: its good property ensures that the entire codomain is involved in the mapping, but its bad property means that some elements of the codomain are double-mapped. This also means that an injection can be upgraded to a bijection, but surjection cannot.

* Bijection means a mapping is both one-to-one and onto. It is a perfect mapping from one element of the domain to one element in the codomain, with the entire codomain involved in the mapping.

* Bijective mapping: `dom(f) = cod(f) = ran(f)`

* Bijective mapping is fully invertable; an `f` has an inverse mapping, `f⁻¹`, `f(a)=b -> ∀b ∈ B. f⁻¹(b)=a`.

* If the codomain of an injection `f` is shrinked to be equal to the range of `f`, the `f` would be bijective. So, an injection can be "upgraded" to a bijection, which cannot be done for surjection.
