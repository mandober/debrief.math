## ADVANCED LINEAR ALGEBRA I
MATHEMATICS CS 108A, EC# 32771

The language and concepts of matrix theory and, more generally, of linear algebra have come into widespread usage in the social and natural sciences, computer science, and statistics. In addition, linear algebra continues to be of great importance in modern treatments of geometry and analysis.

In this course, we will cover the main topics in Linear Algebra:
- Algebra of matrices
- linear systems of equations
- vector spaces
- linear independence
- basis and dimension
- infinite-dimensional vectors spaces
- linear transformations
- matrix representation
- isomorphisms
- quotient spaces
- dual spaces
- determinants
