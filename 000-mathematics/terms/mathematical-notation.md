**Mathematical notation** is a system of symbolic representations of mathematical objects and concepts.

Mathematical notations include relatively simple symbolic representations, such as the numbers, variables, delimiters, function symbols, operator symbols, relational symbols, conceptual symbols (lim and dy/dx), equations, complex diagrammatic notations such as Penrose graphical notation and Coxeterâ€“Dynkin diagrams.
