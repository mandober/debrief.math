- 953 Arithmetic of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system at first required the use of a dust board (a sort of handheld blackboard) because "methods required moving the numbers around in the calculation and rubbing some out as the calculation proceeded". Al-Uqlidisi modified these methods for pen and paper use. Eventually the advances enabled by the decimal system led to its standard use throughout the region and the rest of the world.
