# Math Timelines :: Rhetorical stage

Mathematical calculations were described only verbally.

Highlights
~ 3400 BCE Mesopotamia, Sumerians, first numeral system
~ 3100 BCE Egypt, earliest known decimal system
~ 2000 BCE Mesopotamia, Babylonians, base-60 positional numeral system; π≈3.125
~ 1850 BCE π≈3.16

## Rhetorical stage (70,000 BCE to 1000 BCE)

- ~70,000 BCE South Africa, Ochre rocks adorned with scratched geometric patterns (see Blombos Cave).
- ~35,000 BCE to ~20,000 BCE Africa and France, Earliest known prehistoric attempts to quantify time.
- ~20,000 BCE Nile Valley "Ishango bone", possibly the earliest reference to prime numbers and Egyptian multiplication.

3400 BCE to 1650 BCE
- ~3400 BCE Mesopotamia, the Sumerians invent the *first numeral system*, and a system of weights and measures.
- ~3100 BCE Egypt, *earliest known decimal system* allows indefinite counting by way of introducing new symbols.
- ~2800 BCE Indus Valley civilisation: earliest use of *decimal ratios* in a uniform system of ancient weights and measures; the smallest unit of measurement 1.704 mm, the smallest unit of mass 28 g.
-  2700 BCE Egypt, precision surveying.
-  2400 BCE Egypt, precise astronomical calendar, used even in the Middle Ages for its mathematical regularity.
- ~2000 BCE Mesopotamia, the Babylonians use a *base-60 positional numeral system*, first known approximation of `π` at 3.125.
- ~2000 BCE Scotland, carved stone balls exhibit a variety of symmetries including all of the symmetries of Platonic solids (unknown if deliberate).
-  1800 BCE Egypt, "Moscow Mathematical Papyrus", findings volume of a frustum.
- ~1800 BCE "Berlin Papyrus 6619", origin Egypt 19th dynasty, contains a *quadratic equation* and its solution.
-  1650 BCE "Rhind Mathematical Papyrus", copy of a lost scroll (by the scribe Ahmes) from around 1850 BCE, first known approximation of `π` at 3.16; first attempt at squaring the circle; first known use of a sort of cotangent; knowledge of solving *first order linear equations*.
