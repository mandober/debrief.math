## XIX century

- 1801 Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, Carl Friedrich Gauss's number theory treatise, is published in Latin.
- 1805 Adrien-Marie Legendre introduces the method of least squares for fitting a curve to a given set of observations.
- 1806 Louis Poinsot discovers the two remaining Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.
- 1806 Jean-Robert Argand publishes proof of the Fundamental theorem of algebra and the Argand diagram.
- 1807 Joseph Fourier announces his discoveries about the trigonometric decomposition of functions.
- 1811 Carl Friedrich Gauss discusses the meaning of integrals with complex limits and briefly examines the dependence of such integrals on the chosen path of integration.
- 1815 Siméon Denis Poisson carries out integrations along paths in the complex plane.
- 1817 Bernard Bolzano presents the intermediate value theorem-a continuous function that is negative at one point and positive at another point must be zero for at least one point in between. Bolzano gives a first formal (ε, δ)-definition of limit.
- 1821 Augustin-Louis Cauchy publishes Cours d'Analyse which purportedly contains an erroneous "proof" that the pointwise limit of continuous functions is continuous.
- 1822 Augustin-Louis Cauchy presents the Cauchy integral theorem for integration around the boundary of a rectangle in the complex plane.
- 1822 Irisawa Shintarō Hiroatsu analyzes Soddy's hexlet in a Sangaku.
- 1823 Sophie Germain's Theorem is published in the second edition of Adrien-Marie Legendre's Essai sur la théorie des nombres
- 1824 Niels Henrik Abel partially proves the Abel-Ruffini theorem that the general quintic or higher equations cannot be solved by a general formula involving only arithmetical operations and roots.
- 1825 Augustin-Louis Cauchy presents the Cauchy integral theorem for general integration paths-he assumes the function being integrated has a continuous derivative, and he introduces the theory of residues in complex analysis.
- 1825 Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Adrien-Marie Legendre prove Fermat's Last Theorem for n = 5.
- 1825 André-Marie Ampère discovers Stokes' theorem.
- 1826 Niels Henrik Abel gives counterexamples to Augustin-Louis Cauchy's purported 'proof' that the pointwise limit of continuous functions is continuous.
- 1828 George Green proves Green's theorem.
- 1829 János Bolyai, Gauss, and Lobachevsky invent hyperbolic non-Euclidean geometry.
- 1831 Mikhail Vasilievich Ostrogradsky rediscovers and gives the first proof of the divergence theorem earlier described by Lagrange, Gauss and Green.
- 1832 Évariste Galois presents a general condition for the solvability of algebraic equations, thereby essentially founding group theory and Galois theory.
- 1832 Lejeune Dirichlet proves Fermat's Last Theorem for n = 14.
- 1835 Lejeune Dirichlet proves Dirichlet's theorem about prime numbers in arithmetical progressions.
- 1837 Pierre Wantzel proves that doubling the cube and trisecting the angle are impossible with only a compass and straightedge, as well as the full completion of the problem of constructability of regular polygons.
- 1837 Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet develops Analytic number theory.
- 1838 First mention of uniform convergence in a paper by Christoph Gudermann; later formalized by Karl Weierstrass. Uniform convergence is required to fix Augustin-Louis Cauchy erroneous "proof" that the pointwise limit of continuous functions is continuous from Cauchy's 1821 Cours d'Analyse.
- 1841 Karl Weierstrass discovers but does not publish the Laurent expansion theorem.
- 1843 Pierre-Alphonse Laurent discovers and presents the Laurent expansion theorem.
- 1843 William Hamilton discovers the calculus of *quaternions* and deduces that they are non-commutative.
- 1844 Hermann Grassmann publishes his Ausdehnungslehre, from which *linear algebra* is later developed.
- 1847 George Boole formalizes symbolic logic in The Mathematical Analysis of Logic, defining what is now called *Boolean algebra*.
- 1849 George Gabriel Stokes shows that solitary waves can arise from a combination of periodic waves.
- 1850 Victor Alexandre Puiseux distinguishes between poles and branch points and introduces the concept of essential singular points.
- 1850 George Gabriel Stokes rediscovers and proves Stokes' theorem.
- 1854 Bernhard Riemann introduces *Riemannian geometry*.
- 1854 Arthur Cayley shows that quaternions can be used to represent rotations in 4D space.
- 1858 August Ferdinand Möbius invents the Möbius strip.
- 1858 Charles Hermite solves the general quintic equation by means of elliptic and modular functions.
- 1859 Bernhard Riemann formulates the *Riemann hypothesis*, which has strong implications about the distribution of prime numbers.
- 1868 Eugenio Beltrami demonstrates independence of *Euclid's parallel* postulate from the other axioms of Euclidean geometry.
- 1870 Felix Klein constructs an analytic geometry for *Lobachevski's geometry* thereby establishing its self-consistency and the logical independence of Euclid's fifth postulate.
- 1872 Richard Dedekind invents what is now called the *Dedekind Cut* for defining irrational numbers, and now used for defining surreal numbers.
- 1873 Charles Hermite proves that `e` is transcendental.
- 1873 Georg Frobenius presents his method for finding series solutions to linear differential equations with regular singular points.
- 1874 *Georg Cantor* proves that ℝ is uncountably infinite while 𝔸 is countably infinite. His proof does not use his diagonal argument, which he published in 1891.
- 1882 Ferdinand von Lindemann proves that `π` is transcendental and that therefore the circle cannot be squared with a compass and straightedge.
- 1882 Felix Klein invents the Klein bottle.
- 1895 Diederik Korteweg and Gustav de Vries derive the Korteweg-de Vries equation to describe the development of long solitary water waves in a canal of rectangular cross section.
