The timeline of math is divided here into 3 stages, corresponding to stages in the development of mathematical notation:
- rhetorical: math calculations are described only verbally.
- syncopated: quantities and arithmetic gain symbolic representation.
- symbolic: comprehensive notational systems for formulas is the standard.
