1945 | Jean Leray                          | Starts sheaf theory: At this time a sheaf was a map that assigned a module or a ring to a closed subspace of a topological space. The first example was the sheaf assigning to a closed subspace its p-th cohomology group.

1948 | A. L. Blakers                       | Crossed complexes (called group systems by Blakers), after a suggestion of Samuel Eilenberg: A nonabelian generalization of chain complexes of abelian groups which are equivalent to strict ω-groupoids.

1950 | Samuel Eilenberg-Joe Zilber         | Simplicial sets as a purely algebraic model of well behaved topological spaces. A simplicial set can also be seen as a presheaf on the simplex category. A category is a simplicial set such that the Segal maps are isomorphisms.
1951 | Henri Cartan                        | Modern definition of sheaf theory in which a sheaf is defined using open subsets instead of closed subsets of a topological space and all the open subsets are treated at once. A sheaf on a topological space X becomes a functor resembling a function defined locally on X, and taking values in sets, abelian groups, commutative rings, modules or generally in any category C. In fact Alexander Grothendieck later made a dictionary between sheaves and functions. Another interpretation of sheaves is as continuously varying sets (a generalization of abstract sets). Its purpose is to provide a unified approach to connect local and global properties of topological spaces and to classify the obstructions for passing from local objects to global objects on a topological space by pasting together the local pieces. The C-valued sheaves on a topological space and their homomorphisms form a category.

1958 | Alexander Grothendieck              | Starts new foundation of algebraic geometry by generalizing varieties and other spaces in algebraic geometry to scheme which have the structure of a category with open subsets as objects and restrictions as morphisms. form a category that is a Grothendieck topos, and to a scheme and even a stack one may associate a Zariski topos, an étale topos, a fppf topos, a fpqc topos, a Nisnevich topos, a flat topos, ... depending on the topology imposed on the scheme. The whole of algebraic geometry was categorized with time.
1958 | Roger Godement                      | Monads in category theory (then called standard constructions and triples). Monads generalize classical notions from universal algebra and can in this sense be thought of as an algebraic theory over a category: the theory of the category of T-algebras.

1963 | William Lawvere                     | Founds categorical logic, discovers internal logics of categories and recognizes its importance and introduces Lawvere theories. Essentially categorical logic is a lift of different logics to being internal logics of categories. Each kind of category with extra structure corresponds to a system of logic with its own inference rules. A Lawvere theory is an algebraic theory as a category with finite products and possessing a "generic algebra" (a generic group). The structures described by a Lawvere theory are models of the Lawvere theory

1963 | Charles Ehresmann                   | Internal category theory: Internalization of categories in a category V with pullbacks is replacing the category Set (same for classes instead of sets) by V in the definition of a category. Internalization is a way to rise the categorical dimension
1963 | Charles Ehresmann                   | Multiple categories and multiple functors
1963 | Saunders Mac Lane                   | Monoidal categories, also called tensor categories: Strict 2-categories with one object made by a relabelling trick to categories with a tensor product of objects that is secretly the composition of morphisms in the 2-category. There are several object in a monoidal category since the relabelling trick makes 2-morphisms of the 2-category to morphisms, morphisms of the 2-category to objects and forgets about the single object. In general a higher relabelling trick works for n-categories with one object to make general monoidal categories. The most common examples include: ribbon categories, braided tensor categories, spherical categories, compact closed categories, symmetric tensor categories, modular categories, autonomous categories, categories with duality

1964 | Alexander Grothendieck              | Topologizes categories axiomatically by imposing a Grothendieck topology on categories which are then called sites.

1964 | Alexander Grothendieck              | Six operations formalism in homological algebra; Rf*, f−1, Rf!, f!, ⊗L, RHom, and proof of its closedness
1964 | Alexander Grothendieck              | Introduced in a letter to Jean-Pierre Serre conjectural motives to express the idea that there is a single universal cohomology theory underlying the various cohomology theories for algebraic varieties. According to Grothendieck's philosophy there should be a universal cohomology functor attaching a pure motive h(X) to each smooth projective variety X. When X is not smooth or projective h(X) must be replaced by a more general mixed motive which has a weight filtration whose quotients are pure motives. The category of motives (the categorical framework for the universal cohomology theory) may be used as an abstract substitute for singular cohomology (and rational cohomology) to compare, relate and unite "motivated" properties and parallel phenomena of the various cohomology theories and to detect topological structure of algebraic varieties. The categories of pure motives and of mixed motives are abelian tensor categories and the category of pure motives is also a Tannakian category. Categories of motives are made by replacing the category of varieties by a category with the same objects but whose morphisms are correspondences, modulo a suitable equivalence relation; different equivalences give different theories. Rational equivalence gives the category of Chow motives with Chow groups as morphisms which are in some sense universal. Every geometric cohomology theory is a functor on the category of motives. Each induced functor ρ:motives modulo numerical equivalence→graded Q-vector spaces is called a realization of the category of motives, the inverse functors are called improvements. Mixed motives explain phenomena in as diverse areas as: Hodge theory, algebraic K-theory, polylogarithms, regulator maps, automorphic forms, L-functions, ℓ-adic representations, trigonometric sums, homotopy of algebraic varieties, algebraic cycles, moduli spaces and thus has the potential of enriching each area and of unifying them all.

1965 | Max Kelly-Samuel Eilenberg          | Enriched category theory: Categories C enriched over a category V are categories with Hom-sets HomC not just a set or class but with the structure of objects in the category V. Enrichment over V is a way to rise the categorical dimension

1967 | Daniel Quillen                      | Quillen model categories and Quillen model functors: A framework for doing homotopy theory in an axiomatic way in categories and an abstraction of homotopy categories in such a way that hC = C[W−1] where W−1 are the inverted weak equivalences of the Quillen model category C. Quillen model categories are homotopically complete and cocomplete, and come with a built-in Eckmann-Hilton duality
1967 | Daniel Quillen                      | "Homotopical algebra" (published as a book and also sometimes called noncommutative homological algebra): The study of various model categories and the interplay between fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences in arbitrary closed model categories

It is sometimes referred to by Grothendieck as the yoga of de Rham coefficients and Hodge coefficients since crystalline cohomology of a variety X in characteristic p is like de Rham cohomology mod p of X and there is an isomorphism between de Rham cohomology groups and Hodge cohomology groups of harmonic forms
1968 | Alexander Grothendieck              | Grothendieck connection
1968 | Alexander Grothendieck              | Formulates the standard conjectures on algebraic cycles

1968 | Charles Ehresmann                   | Sketches: An alternative way of presenting a theory (which is categorical in character as opposed to linguistic) whose models are to study in appropriate categories. A sketch is a small category with a set of distinguished cones and a set of distinguished cocones satisfying some axioms. A model of a sketch is a set-valued functor transforming the distinguished cones into limit cones and the distinguished cocones into colimit cones. The categories of models of sketches are exactly the accessible categories

1970 | William Lawvere-Myles Tierney       | Elementary topoi: Categories modeled after the category of sets which are like universes (generalized spaces) of sets in which one can do mathematics.

1970 | John Conway                         | Skein theory of knots: The computation of knot invariants by skein modules. Skein modules can be based on quantum invariants

General categorical topology study and uses structured sets in a topological category as general topology study and uses topological spaces. Algebraic categorical topology tries to apply the machinery of algebraic topology for topological spaces to structured sets in a topological category.

1972 | John Isbell | Locales: A "generalized topological space" or "pointless spaces" defined by a lattice (a complete Heyting algebra also called a Brouwer lattice) just as for a topological space the open subsets form a lattice. If the lattice possess enough points it is a topological space. Locales are the main objects of pointless topology, the dual objects being frames. Both locales and frames form categories that are each other's opposite. Sheaves can be defined over locales. The other "spaces" one can define sheaves over are sites. Although locales were known earlier John Isbell first named them
1972 | Ross Street | Formal theory of monads: The theory of monads in 2-categories
1972 | Peter Freyd | Fundamental theorem of topos theory: Every slice category (E,Y) of a topos E is a topos and the functor f*: (E,X) → (E,Y) preserves exponentials and the subobject classifier object Ω and has a right and left adjoint functor
1972 | Alexander Grothendieck | Grothendieck universes for sets as part of foundations for categories
1972 | Jean Bénabou-Ross Street | Cosmoses which categorize universes: A cosmos is a generalized universe of 1-categories in which you can do category theory. When set theory is generalized to the study of a Grothendieck topos, the analogous generalization of category theory is the study of a cosmos.
  Ross Street definition: A bicategory such that
  small bicoproducts exist;
  each monad admits a Kleisli construction (analogous to the quotient of an equivalence relation in a topos);
  it is locally small-cocomplete; and
  there exists a small Cauchy generator.

  Jean Bénabou definition: A bicomplete symmetric monoidal closed category
1972 | Peter May | Operads: An abstraction of the family of composable functions of several variables together with an action of permutation of variables. Operads can be seen as algebraic theories and algebras over operads are then models of the theories. Each operad gives a monad on Top. Multicategories with one object are operads. PROPs generalize operads to admit operations with several inputs and several outputs. Operads are used in defining opetopes, higher category theory, homotopy theory, homological algebra, algebraic geometry, string theory and many other areas.
1972 | William Mitchell-Jean Bénabou | Mitchell-Bénabou internal language of a toposes: For a topos E with subobject classifier object Ω a language (or type theory) L(E) where:
  the types are the objects of E
  terms of type X in the variables xi of type Xi are polynomial expressions φ(x1,...,xm): 1→X in the arrows xi: 1→Xi in E
  formulas are terms of type Ω (arrows from types to Ω)
  connectives are induced from the internal Heyting algebra structure of Ω
  quantifiers bounded by types and applied to formulas are also treated
  for each type X there are also two binary relations =X (defined applying the diagonal map to the product term of the arguments) and ∈X (defined applying the evaluation map to the product of the term and the power term of the arguments).
  A formula is true if the arrow which interprets it factor through the arrow true:1→Ω. The Mitchell-Bénabou internal language is a powerful way to describe various objects in a topos as if they were sets and hence is a way of making the topos into a generalized set theory, to write and prove statements in a topos using first order intuitionistic predicate logic, to consider toposes as type theories and to express properties of a topos. Any language L also generates a linguistic topos E(L)
1973 | Chris Reedy | Reedy categories: Categories of "shapes" that can be used to do homotopy theory. A Reedy category is a category R equipped with a structure enabling the inductive construction of diagrams and natural transformations of shape R. The most important consequence of a Reedy structure on R is the existence of a model structure on the functor category MR whenever M is a model category. Another advantage of the Reedy structure is that its cofibrations, fibrations and factorizations are explicit. In a Reedy category there is a notion of an injective and a surjective morphism such that any morphism can be factored uniquely as a surjection followed by an injection. Examples are the ordinal α considered as a poset and hence a category. The opposite R° of a Reedy category R is also a Reedy category. The simplex category Δ and more generally for any simplicial set X its category of simplices Δ/X is a Reedy category. The model structure on MΔ for a model category M is described in an unpublished manuscript by Chris Reedy

1973 | Michael Boardman-Rainer Vogt | Segal categories: Simplicial analogues of A∞-categories. They naturally generalize simplicial categories, in that they can be regarded as simplicial categories with composition only given up to homotopy.
  Def: A simplicial space X such that X0 (the set of points) is a discrete simplicial set and the Segal map
  φk : Xk → X1 × X0 ... × X0 X1 (induced by X(αi): Xk → X1) assigned to X
  is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets for k ≥ 2.
  Segal categories are a weak form of S-categories, in which composition is only defined up to a coherent system of equivalences.
  Segal categories were defined one year later implicitly by Graeme Segal. They were named Segal categories first by William Dwyer-Daniel Kan-Jeffrey Smith 1989. In their famous book Homotopy invariant algebraic structures on topological spaces, J. Michael Boardman and Rainer Vogt called them quasi-categories. A quasi-category is a simplicial set satisfying the weak Kan condition, so quasi-categories are also called weak Kan complexes
1973 | Daniel Quillen | Frobenius categories: An exact category in which the classes of injective and projective objects coincide and for all objects x in the category there is a deflation P(x)→x (the projective cover of x) and an inflation x→I(x) (the injective hull of x) such that both P(x) and I(x) are in the category of pro/injective objects. A Frobenius category E is an example of a model category and the quotient E/P (P is the class of projective/injective objects) is its homotopy category hE

1976 | Marcel Crabbe | Heyting categories also called logoses: Regular categories in which the subobjects of an object form a lattice, and in which each inverse image map has a right adjoint. More precisely a coherent category C such that for all morphisms f:A→B in C the functor f*:SubC(B)→SubC(A) has a left adjoint and a right adjoint. SubC(A) is the preorder of subobjects of A (the full subcategory of C/A whose objects are subobjects of A) in C. Every topos is a logos. Heyting categories generalize Heyting algebras.

1977 | Andre Boileau-André Joyal-John Zangwill | LST, local set theory: Local set theory is a typed set theory whose underlying logic is higher-order intuitionistic logic. It is a generalization of classical set theory, in which sets are replaced by terms of certain types. The category C(S) built out of a local theory S whose objects are the local sets (or S-sets) and whose arrows are the local maps (or S-maps) is a linguistic topos. Every topos E is equivalent to a linguistic topos C(S(E))
1977 | John Roberts | Introduces most general nonabelian cohomology of ω-categories with ω-categories as coefficients when he realized that general cohomology is about coloring simplices in ω-categories.

The two approaches are related by codescent

1978 | Don Anderson | Building on work of Kenneth Brown defines ABC (co)fibration categories for doing homotopy theory and more general ABC model categories, but the theory lies dormant until 2003. Every Quillen model category is an ABC model category. A difference to Quillen model categories is that in ABC model categories fibrations and cofibrations are independent and that for an ABC model category MD is an ABC model category. To an ABC (co)fibration category is canonically associated a (left) right Heller derivator. Topological spaces with homotopy equivalences as weak equivalences, Hurewicz cofibrations as cofibrations and Hurewicz fibrations as fibrations form an ABC model category, the Hurewicz model structure on Top. Complexes of objects in an abelian category with quasi-isomorphisms as weak equivalences and monomorphisms as cofibrations form an ABC precofibration category

1993 | Kenji Fukaya | A∞-categories and A∞-functors: Most commonly in homological algebra, a category with several compositions such that the first composition is associative up to homotopy which satisfies an equation that holds up to another homotopy, etc. (associative up to higher homotopy). A stands for associative.
  Def: A category C such that
  for all X, Y in Ob(C) the Hom-sets HomC(X,Y) are finite-dimensional chain complexes of Z-graded modules
  for all objects X1, ..., Xn in Ob(C) there is a family of linear composition maps (the higher compositions)
  mn : HomC(X0,X1) ⊗ HomC(X1,X2) ⊗ ... ⊗ HomC(Xn−1,Xn) → HomC(X0,Xn)
  of degree n − 2 (homological grading convention is used) for n ≥ 1
  m1 is the differential on the chain complex HomC(X,Y)
  mn satisfy the quadratic A∞-associativity equation for all n ≥ 0.
  m1 and m2 will be chain maps but the compositions mi of higher order are not chain maps; nevertheless they are Massey products. In particular it is a linear category.
  Examples are the Fukaya category Fuk(X) and loop space ΩX where X is a topological space and A∞-algebras as A∞-categories with one object.
  When there are no higher maps (trivial homotopies) C is a dg-category. Every A∞-category is quasiisomorphic in a functorial way to a dg-category. A quasiisomorphism is a chain map that is an isomorphism in homology.
  The framework of dg-categories and dg-functors is too narrow for many problems, and it is preferable to consider the wider class of A∞-categories and A∞-functors. Many features of A∞-categories and A∞-functors come from the fact that they form a symmetric closed multicategory, which is revealed in the language of comonads. From a higher-dimensional perspective A∞-categories are weak ω-categories with all morphisms invertible. A∞-categories can also be viewed as noncommutative formal dg-manifolds with a closed marked subscheme of objects.

1995 | André Joyal-Ieke Moerdijk | "AST - Algebraic set theory". Also sometimes called categorical set theory. It was developed from 1988 by André Joyal and Ieke Moerdijk, and was first presented in detail as a book in 1995 by them. AST is a framework based on category theory to study and organize set theories and to construct models of set theories. The aim of AST is to provide a uniform categorical semantics or description of set theories of different kinds (classical or constructive, bounded, predicative or impredicative, well-founded or non-well-founded, ...), the various constructions of the cumulative hierarchy of sets, forcing models, sheaf models and realisability models. Instead of focusing on categories of sets AST focuses on categories of classes. The basic tool of AST is the notion of a category with class structure (a category of classes equipped with a class of small maps (the intuition being that their fibres are small in some sense), powerclasses and a universal object (a universe)) which provides an axiomatic framework in which models of set theory can be constructed. The notion of a class category permits both the definition of ZF-algebras (Zermelo-Fraenkel algebras) and related structures expressing the idea that the hierarchy of sets is an algebraic structure on the one hand and the interpretation of the first-order logic of elementary set theory on the other. The subcategory of sets in a class category is an elementary topos and every elementary topos occurs as sets in a class category. The class category itself always embeds into the ideal completion of a topos. The interpretation of the logic is that in every class category the universe is a model of basic intuitionistic set theory (BIST) that is logically complete with respect to class category models. Therefore, class categories generalize both topos theory and intuitionistic set theory. AST founds and formalizes set theory on the ZF-algebra with operations union and successor (singleton) instead of on the membership relation. The ZF-axioms are nothing but a description of the free ZF-algebra just as the Peano axioms are a description of the free monoid on one generator. In this perspective the models of set theory are algebras for a suitably presented algebraic theory and many familiar set theoretic conditions (such as well-foundedness) are related to familiar algebraic conditions (such as freeness). Using an auxiliary notion of small map it is possible to extend the axioms of a topos and provide a general theory for uniformly constructing models of set theory out of toposes.
1995 | Michael Makkai | SFAM, Structuralist foundation of abstract mathematics. In SFAM the universe consists of higher-dimensional categories, functors are replaced by saturated anafunctors, sets are abstract sets, the formal logic for entities is FOLDS (first-order logic with dependent sorts) in which the identity relation is not given a priori by first-order axioms but derived from within a context.

1998 | André Hirschowitz-Carlos Simpson | Give a model category structure on the category of Segal categories. Segal categories are the fibrant-cofibrant objects and Segal maps are the weak equivalences. In fact they generalize the definition to that of a Segal n-category and give a model structure for Segal n-categories for any n ≥ 1.
1998 | Chris Isham-Jeremy Butterfield | Kochen-Specker theorem in topos theory of presheaves: The spectral presheaf (the presheaf that assigns to each operator its spectrum) has no global elements (global sections) but may have partial elements or local elements. A global element is the analogue for presheaves of the ordinary idea of an element of a set. This is equivalent in quantum theory to the spectrum of the C*-algebra of observables in a topos having no points.
1998 | Richard Thomas | Richard Thomas, a student of Simon Donaldson, introduces Donaldson-Thomas invariants which are systems of numerical invariants of complex oriented 3-manifolds X, analogous to Donaldson invariants in the theory of 4-manifolds. They are certain weighted Euler characteristics of the moduli space of sheaves on X and "count" Gieseker semistable coherent sheaves with fixed Chern character on X. Ideally the moduli spaces should be a critical sets of holomorphic Chern-Simons functions and the Donaldson-Thomas invariants should be the number of critical points of this function, counted correctly. Currently such holomorphic Chern-Simons functions exist at best locally.
1998 | John Baez | Spin foam models: A 2-dimensional cell complex with faces labeled by representations and edges labeled by intertwining operators. Spin foams are functors between spin network categories. Any slice of a spin foam gives a spin network.
1998 | John Baez-James Dolan | Microcosm principle: Certain algebraic structures can be defined in any category equipped with a categorified version of the same structure.
1998 | Alexander Rosenberg | Noncommutative schemes: The pair (Spec(A),OA) where A is an abelian category and to it is associated a topological space Spec(A) together with a sheaf of rings OA on it. In the case when A = QCoh(X) for X a scheme the pair (Spec(A),OA) is naturally isomorphic to the scheme (XZar,OX) using the equivalence of categories QCoh(Spec(R)) = ModR. More generally abelian categories or triangulated categories or dg-categories or A∞-categories should be regarded as categories of quasicoherent sheaves (or complexes of sheaves) on noncommutative schemes. This is a starting point in noncommutative algebraic geometry. It means that one can think of the category A itself as a space. Since A is abelian it allows to naturally do homological algebra on noncommutative schemes and hence sheaf cohomology.
1998 | Maxim Kontsevich | Calabi-Yau categories: A linear category with a trace map for each object of the category and an associated symmetric (with respects to objects) nondegenerate pairing to the trace map. If X is a smooth projective Calabi-Yau variety of dimension d then Db(Coh(X)) is a unital Calabi-Yau A∞-category of Calabi-Yau dimension d. A Calabi-Yau category with one object is a Frobenius algebra.
1999 | Joseph Bernstein-Igor Frenkel-Mikhail Khovanov | Temperley-Lieb categories: Objects are enumerated by nonnegative integers. The set of homomorphisms from object n to object m is a free R-module with a basis over a ring R.

The topology on a space is treated not as a lattice, but as an exponential object of the same category as the original space, with an associated λ-calculus. Every expression in the λ-calculus denotes both a continuous function and a program. ASD does not use the category of sets, but the full subcategory of overt discrete objects plays this role (an overt object is the dual to a compact object), forming an arithmetic universe (pretopos with lists) with general recursion.

2001 | Charles Rezk | Constructs a model category with certain generalized Segal categories as the fibrant objects, thus obtaining a model for a homotopy theory of homotopy theories. Complete Segal spaces are introduced at the same time.
2001 | Charles Rezk | Model toposes and their generalization homotopy toposes (a model topos without the t-completeness assumption).
2002 | Bertrand Toën-Gabriele Vezzosi | Segal toposes coming from Segal topologies, Segal sites and stacks over them.
2002 | Bertrand Toën-Gabriele Vezzosi | Homotopical algebraic geometry: The main idea is to extend schemes by formally replacing the rings with any kind of "homotopy-ring-like object". More precisely this object is a commutative monoid in a symmetric monoidal category endowed with a notion of equivalences which are understood as "up-to-homotopy monoid" (e.g. E∞-rings).
2002 | Peter Johnstone | Influential book: "Sketches of an elephant - a topos theory compendium". It serves as an encyclopedia of topos theory (two out of three volumes published as of 2008).
2002 | Dennis Gaitsgory-Kari Vilonen-Edward Frenkel | PROVES the geometric Langlands program for GL(n) over finite fields.
2003 | Denis-Charles Cisinski | Makes further work on ABC model categories and brings them back into light. From then they are called ABC model categories after their contributors.
2004 | Dennis Gaitsgory | Extended the proof of the geometric Langlands program to include GL(n) over C. This allows to consider curves over C instead of over finite fields in the geometric Langlands program.
2004 | Mario Caccamo | Formal category theoretical expanded λ-calculus for categories.
2004 | Francis Borceux-Dominique Bourn | Homological categories
2004 | Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke | Paper A categorical semantics of quantum protocols published that starts the Oxford school of Categorical Quantum Mechanics, based on the theory of compact closed categories.
2004 | William Dwyer-Philips Hirschhorn-Daniel Kan-Jeffrey Smith | Introduces in the book "Homotopy limit", functors on model categories and homotopical categories a formalism of homotopical categories and homotopical functors (weak equivalence preserving functors) that generalize the model category formalism of Daniel Quillen. A homotopical category has only a distinguished class of morphisms (containing all isomorphisms) called weak equivalences and satisfy the two out of six axiom. This allows to define homotopical versions of initial and terminal objects, limit and colimit functors (that are computed by local constructions in the book), completeness and cocompleteness, adjunctions, Kan extensions and universal properties.
2004 | Dominic Verity | PROOF of the Street-Roberts conjecture.
2004 | Ross Street | Definition of the descent weak ω-category of a cosimplicial weak ω-category.
2004 | Ross Street | Characterization theorem for cosmoses: A bicategory M is a cosmos iff there exists a base bicategory W such that M is biequivalent to ModW. W can be taken to be any full subbicategory of M whose objects form a small Cauchy generator.
2004 | Ross Street-Brian Day | Quantum categories and quantum groupoids: A quantum category over a braided monoidal category V is an object R with an opmorphism h: Rop ⊗ R → A into a pseudomonoid A such that h* is strong monoidal (preserves tensor product and unit up to coherent natural isomorphisms) and all R, h and A lie in the autonomous monoidal bicategory Comod(V)co of comonoids. Comod(V) = Mod(Vop)coop. Quantum categories were introduced to generalize Hopf algebroids and groupoids. A quantum groupoid is a Hopf algebra with several objects.
2004 | Stephan Stolz-Peter Teichner | Definition of nD QFT of degree p parametrized by a manifold.
2004 | Sephan Stolz-Peter Teichner | Graeme Segal proposed in the 1980s to provide a geometric construction of elliptic cohomology (the precursor to tmf) as some kind of moduli space of CFTs. Stephan Stolz and Peter Teichner continued and expanded these ideas in a program to construct TMF as a moduli space of supersymmetric Euclidean field theories. They conjectured a Stolz-Teichner picture (analogy) between classifying spaces of cohomology theories in the chromatic filtration (de Rham cohomology, K-theory, Morava K-theories) and moduli spaces of supersymmetric QFTs parametrized by a manifold (PROVED in 0D and 1D).

2006 | Jacob Lurie | Monumental book: "Higher topos theory". In its 940 pages Jacob Lurie generalizes the common concepts of category theory to Higher Categories and defines n-toposes, ∞-toposes, sheaves of n-types, ∞-sites, ∞-Yoneda lemma and PROVES Lurie characterization theorem for higher-dimensional toposes. Lurie's theory of higher toposes can be interpreted as giving a good theory of sheaves taking values in ∞-categories. Roughly an ∞-topos is an ∞-category which looks like the ∞-category of all homotopy types. In a topos mathematics can be done. In a higher topos not only mathematics can be done but also "n-geometry", which is higher homotopy theory. The topos hypothesis is that the (n+1)-category nCat is a Grothendieck (n+1)-topos. Higher topos theory can also be used in a purely algebro-geometric way to solve various moduli problems in this setting.
