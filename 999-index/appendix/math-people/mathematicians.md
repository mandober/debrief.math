## Al-Khwarizmi (780-850)
- Al-Khwarizmi (c. 780-850)
  - Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (latinized as 'Algorithmi')
  - Muhammad ibn Musa al-Gorithmi
  - born in Persia (Iran)
- founder of algebra
- word "algorithm" is derived from his name
- established math-as-calculations approach
- contributed to mathematics, astronomy, geography
- invented complete-the-square approach for solving linear and quadratic equations.
- word "algebra" comes from the title of his book; the word 'al-jabr' means 'completion', 'rejoining'.
- XII century's latin translation of his book on arithmetic "Algorithmo de Numero Indorum" introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world.
- Latin translation of his book "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" was used as the principal math textbook in European universities until XVI century.
- Al-Khwarizmi had also revised Ptolemy's Geography, listing the longitudes and latitudes of various cities and localities, produced a set of astronomical tables and wrote about calendaric works, as well as the astrolabe and the sundial.
- Al-Khwarizmi also made important contributions to trigonometry, producing accurate sine and cosine tables, and the first table of tangents.

## Aristotle
Aristotle (384-322 BCE), born in Stagira, Chalkidiki, North of Greece. Considered the father of Western Philosophy, contributed to its lexicon, including problems and methods of inquiry thereby influencing almost all forms of knowledge. Aristotle had planted the roots of formalized logic.

## Cantor
Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor (1845-1918) was a German mathematician, the creator of set theory. Cantor established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and proved that the infinity of real numbers is a larger infinity then the infinity of the natural numbers, demonstrating the existence of an infinity of infinities. Cantor defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers, their arithmetic, and the transfinite induction.

## Church
Alonzo Church (1903-1995)
was an American mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematical logic and the foundations of theoretical CS. He is best known for the creation of lambda calculus. His other accomplishments include Church-Turing thesis, proving the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, Frege-Church ontology, the Church-Rosser theorem.

## Rosser
John Barkley Rosser Sr. (1907-1989)
was an American logician
a student of Alonzo Church

## Dedekind
Julius Wilhelm Richard Dedekind (1831-1916) was a German mathematician, made contributions to number theory, abstract algebra (particularly ring theory), and the axiomatic foundations of arithmetic. His best known contribution is the definition of real numbers through the notion of Dedekind cut. He is also considered a pioneer in the development of modern set theory and of the philosophy of mathematics known as Logicism.

## Euclid
Euclid of Alexandria (325-265 BCE)
Egypt. For Euclid, mathematics consists of proofs and constructions. His book "Elements" had introduced rigorous argumentation and was used as a primary textbook for geometry until about XIX century, at which time, it turned out, he wasn't rigorous enough, some might say he was outright sloppy. However, his intentions were fair, so the idea of mathematical rigor and the desire to shoot for perfection, the main products Euclid was peddling, took strong hold in mathematics and became associated to his name.

## Frege
Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege (1848-1925)
- Germany
- philosophy, logic, math
- father of analytic philosophy, philosophy of language and math
- widely ignored during his lifetime (re-intro by Peano and Russell)
- contributions to development of modern logic with "Begriffsschrift"
- foundations of mathematics with "Foundations of Arithmetic"
- His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn.
- Frege invented a universal characteristic in 1879; he called it "Begriffsschrift". With it, Frege introduced propositional and predicate calculus.

## Gauss
Carl Friedrich Gauß (1777-1855)
was French matematician

## Gentzen
Gerhard Gentzen (1909-1945)
was a German logician best known for inventing sequent calculus - a system of natural deduction that allows writing proofs in a mathematically natural way. Unlike most logicians, Gentzen skipped crazy and went full nazi (isomorphic shit).

## Gödel
Kurt Gödel 1906-1978

## Hankel
Hermann Hankel (1839-1873)
a student of Riemann

## Riemann
Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866)

## Klein
Felix Klein (1849-1925)

## Grassmann
- Hermann Günther Graßmann (1809-1877)
- German
- challenged aritmetic prompting Peano's work
- from the early 1830s, working on math foundations, discovered Linear Algebra
- `The Ausdehnungslehre` (Theory of Extension) in 1844. "I realized that there must be a branch of mathematics which yields in a purely abstract way laws similar to those that in geometry seem bound to space. I soon realized that I had come upon the domain of a new science of which geometry itself is only a special application."
- His entirely abstract approach allowed him to consider new mathematical ideas such as n-dimensional spaces and noncommutative multiplication
- "Every displacement of a system of m-th order can be represented as a sum of m displacements belonging to m given independent methods of evolution of the system, the sum being unique for each such set".

## Hilbert
David Hilbert (1862-1943)
was a famous German mathematician, recognized as one of the most influential and universal mathematicians in his time.
Hilbert discovered and developed a broad range of fundamental ideas in many areas, including invariant theory, calculus of variations, commutative algebra, algebraic number theory, the foundations of geometry, spetral theory of operators and its application to integral equations, mathematical physics, and foundations of mathematics (particularly proof theory).
Hilbert adopted and warmly defended Georg Cantor's set theory and transfinite numbers. A famous example of his leadership in mathematics is his 1900 presentation of a collection of problems that set the course for much of the mathematical research of the 20th century.

## Huygens
Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695)
was a Dutch mathematician, astronomer, physicist. He exchanged correspondence with Leibniz.

## Leibniz
Gotfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716)
was a german polymath that invented calculus (independently from Newton). His stance of the mathematical proof was that arguing is futile and that all that needs to be done is to calculate it, embodied in his *Calculemus!* motto. The part of his "let's calculate it" motion was the idea of constructing a suitable universal language for writing math proofs. In 1679, Leibniz wrote to Huygens (published in 1833): "I am still not satisfied with algebra. I believe that, so far as geometry is concerned, we still need another analysis which is distinctly geometrical or linear and which will express situation directly as algebra expresses magnitude. I believe that by this method one could treat mechanics almost like geometry, and one could even test the qualities of materials. I have no hope that we can get very far in physics until we have found such a method". Leibniz never managed to invent the method he envisioned that later became *linear algebra*.

## Łukasiewicz
Jan Łukasiewicz (1878-1956) Poland    
Logician and philosopher born in Lemberg, a city in the Galician kingdom of Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine). His work centred on philosophical logic, mathematical logic, and history of logic. He thought innovatively about traditional propositional logic, the principle of non-contradiction and the law of excluded middle. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Łukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Łukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley - which inform modern translations of Prior Analytics by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009. Łukasiewicz is regarded as one of the most important historians of logic.

## Kleene
Stephen Cole Kleene (1909-1994)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene
was an American mathematician.

One of the students of Alonzo Church, Kleene, along with Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of mathematical logic known as recursion theory, which subsequently helped to provide the foundations of theoretical computer science.

Kleene's work grounds the study of computable functions. A number of mathematical concepts are named after him: Kleene hierarchy, Kleene algebra, the Kleene star (Kleene closure), Kleene's recursion theorem and the Kleene fixpoint theorem. He also invented regular expressions, and made significant contributions to the foundations of mathematical intuitionism.

## Turing
Alan Turing (1912-1954)
was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Whitehead
