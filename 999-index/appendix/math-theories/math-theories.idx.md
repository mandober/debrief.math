*Homotopy theory* is a systematic study of situations in which maps come with homotopies between them. It originated as a topic in algebraic topology but nowadays is studied as an independent discipline.

A [function] (also called a procedure, method, subroutine, or routine or macro) is a portion of code intended to carry out a single, specific task. Use this tag for questions which specifically involve creating or calling functions. For help implementing a function to perform a task, use [algorithm] or a task-specific tag instead. By creating function the logic can be isolated and can be called repeatedly.
