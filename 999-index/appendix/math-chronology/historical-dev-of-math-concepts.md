Classic vs modern interpretations of mathematical concepts:

* axioms
  - are obvious implications of definitions
  - are conventional
* theorems
  - are absolute objective truth
  - are implications of the corresponding axioms
* relations (between points, lines etc.)
  - are determined by their nature
  - are essential, their nature is not
* mathematical objects
  - are given to us with their structure
  - each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties
* geometry
  - corresponds to an experimental reality
  - is a mathematical truth
* geometric properties
  - all geometric properties of a space follow from the axioms
  - axioms of a space need not determine all geometric properties
* geometry
  - is an autonomous and living science
  - classical geometry is a universal language of mathematics
* space
  - space is three-dimensional
  - different concepts of dimension apply to different kinds of spaces
* space
  - space is the universe of geometry
  - spaces are just mathematical structures, occuring in various math areas
