A relation between two sets is a collection of ordered pairs containing one object from each set. If the object x is from the first set and the object y is from the second set, then the objects are said to be related if the ordered pair (x,y) is in the relation.

A function is a type of relation. But, a relation is allowed to have the object x in the first set to be related to more than one object in the second set. So a relation may not be represented by a function machine, because, given the object x to the input of the machine, the machine couldn't spit out a unique output object that is paired to x.
