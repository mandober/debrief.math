## Set

A set is a *mathematical primitive* that elides any attempt to define it. The concept of sets is often introduced by an informal description appealing to the reader's intuition: 
> A set is a simple (unstructured) collection of objects, called its elements or members, that has no notion of element ordering and object's multiplicity.

Alternativelly, sets may be introduced by an axiom. **The axiom of the empty set** posits the existence of a set with no elements. It is an axiom in the KP (Kripke-Platek) set theory, and a demonstrable truth in ZF(C), where it may be expressed as `∃x.∀y.y ∉ x`; in ZF, all vars range over sets, so this formala states that there exists a set `x`, such that for all sets `y`, `y` is not a member of `x`. ZF is intended to formalize a single primitive notion, that of *hereditary well-founded set*, so the enire universe of discourse consists only of such sets.

Thus, the axioms of ZF refer exclusively to **pure sets**, and prevent its models from containing **urelements** (elements of sets that are not themselves sets). Furthermore, **proper classes** (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members, where the collections are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly. Specifically, ZF doesn't allow for the existence of a **universal set** (a set containing all sets), nor for *unrestricted comprehension*, thereby avoiding Russell's paradox. NBG (Von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel) set theory, a common *conservative extension* of ZF, does treat proper classes explicitly.
