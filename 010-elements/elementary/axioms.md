- Axioms of geometry
  - Euclid's Axioms
- Axioms of arithmetic
  - Peano axioms
- Axioms of set theory
  - ZFC set theory axioms
- Axioms of relation theory
  - Axioms of equality
  - equivalence relation: Reflexivity, Symmetry, Transitivity (RST)
  - other (Refl, Symm, Trans)-based relations: co-, quasi-, a-, anti-, …
- Axioms of order theory
  - Partial order: Reflexivity, Antisymmetry, Transitivity (RAST)
- Axioms of algebra
  - Axioms of algebraic structures


Axioms make best sense in terms of an algebraic structure =    
carrier set + attached operations/relations + set of axioms
- axioms of partial order = Reflexivity + Antisymmetry + Transitivity
- poset = e.g. integer set + partial order relation

## Euclid's axioms

Euclidean geometry is an axiomatic system, in which all theorems ("true statements") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of non-Euclidean geometry, these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.

Near the beginning of the first book of the Elements, Euclid gives 5 postulates (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions.

Let the following be postulated:
- To draw a straight line from any point to any point.
- To produce (extend) a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.
- To describe a circle with any centre and distance (radius).
- That all right angles are equal to one another.
- (The parallel postulate): That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.


In addition to his axiom, Euclid had introduced a number of *common notions* which, unlike the axioms that were only about geometry, dealt with logic in general:
1. Things equal to another thing are equal to each other.
- Magnitudes equal to the same are equal to each other
2. If equal amounts are added to each of the equal quantities, they remain equal still.
3. If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal still.
4. Things that coincide with one another are equal to each other.
5. Totum parte majus est.






## Axioms of Algebra ?

There are 5 axioms of algebra:
- equivalence
+ additive axiom?! (a = b ⋀ c = d) -> (a + c = b + d)
+ multiplicative axiom?! (a = b ⋀ c = d) -> (ac = bd)



Closure Axiom of Addition
Closure Axiom of Multiplication
Commutative Axiom of Addition
Commutative Axiom of Multiplication
Associative Axiom of Addition
Associative Axiom of Multiplication
Axiom of Zero for Addition (Identity for Addition)
Axiom of One for Multiplication (Identity for Multiplication)
Axiom of Additive Inverses, a + (-a) = 0 = (-a) + a
  subtraction: a - b = a + (-b)
Axiom of Multiplicative Inverses, a ⨯ 1/a = 1 = 1/a ⨯ a (for a ≠ 0)
  division: a ÷ b = a ⨯ 1/b
Distributive Axiom of Multiplication over Addition
Reflexive
Symmetric
Transitive
