# Basic concepts in math

Branching from these oldest branches of math, there are various different specialisations that have sprouted like Probability and Statistics, Topology, Matrix Algebra, Game Theory, Operations Research, amongst others. Read this blog to know all about branches of mathematics with their list, tree and more!


- comprehension of complexity
  - complex (entity, problem, idea, concept, object)
  - analysis and synthesis
  - decomposition and composition
  - divide and conquer
  - abstraction
- generalization
- mathematical concept


complex entity (concept/object)
↓                             ↑
analysis              synthesis
↓                             ↑ comprehension
decomposition       composition
↓                             ↑ abstraction
comprehension -> abstraction -> generalization
