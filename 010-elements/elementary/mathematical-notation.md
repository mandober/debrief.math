Mathematical notation is a system of symbolic representations of mathematical objects and ideas. Mathematical notations are used in mathematics, the physical sciences, engineering, and economics. Mathematical notations include relatively simple symbolic representations, such as the numbers 0, 1 and 2; function symbols such as sin; operator symbols such as "+"; conceptual symbols such as lim and dy/dx; equations and variables; and complex diagrammatic notations such as Penrose graphical notation and Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams.


Implication:
- $$n \in \mathbb{N} \to S(n)\in \mathbb{N}$$    
- IF n is a natural number THEN the successor of n is a natural number.

**Mathematical notation** is a system of symbolic representations of mathematical objects and concepts.

Mathematical notations include relatively simple symbolic representations, such as the numbers, variables, delimiters, function symbols, operator symbols, relational symbols, conceptual symbols (lim and dy/dx), equations, complex diagrammatic notations such as Penrose graphical notation and Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams.

**Mathematical notation** is a *system of symbolic representations* of *mathematical objects* and *mathematical concepts*.

Mathematical notation includes symbolic representations:
- numeric literals: `-42`, `0.312E-12`, `5i`, `⅞`
- mathematical constants: `i`, `π`, `𝜀`
- variables: `𝓪`,`𝓶`,`𝓷`,`𝔁`,`𝔂`,`𝔃`,`α`,`ρ`,`ϑ`,`𝚽`,`ϐ`,`ϰ`,`φ`
- delimiters:
  - many types of brackets: ⁅ ⁆
  - other delimiters: | :
- function symbols: sin abs λ
- operator symbols:
  - elementary arithmetic: + - ÷ ×
  - arithmetic: ↑ ∑ ∏ ∛ ∞
  - number theory: ∣ ∤
  - sets: ∈ ∩ ∇ ∅
  - logic: ¬ ∨ ∧ ⇒ ≡ ∀ ∃ ∄
  - relational symbols: ≠ ⊆ ⫹ ⋐ ⋞ ⊑ ≪
  - geometric symbols: ∢ ∡ ∠
  - other: ∝ ≌ ∓
  - functions: → ↣ ↦ ⇀
- conceptual symbols: lim, dy/dx, ∳, ∰, ∫
- equations
- complex diagrammatic notations:
  - Venn diagrams
  - Euler diagrams
