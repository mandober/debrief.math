**Mathematical notation** consists of using symbols for representing operations, *unspecified numbers*, relations, and any other mathematical objects and assembling them into expressions and formulas.

Mathematical notation is widely used in mathematics and other sciences for denoting complex concepts in a concise, unambiguous and accurate way.

For example, Albert Einstein's equation `E=mc²` is the quantitative representation in mathematical notation of the mass-energy equivalence.

Mathematical notation was first introduced by *François Viète* at the *end of the 16th century* and largely expanded during the 17th and 18th centuries by René Descartes, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and overall Leonhard Euler.
