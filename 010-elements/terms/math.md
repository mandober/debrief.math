**Abstraction** is the process of extracting the essence from an object, started by removing its dependence on the material world, then generalizing it softly until it bleeds into a new concept.

Mathematics is about discerning patterns, making their idealized representation, describing their properties, discovering the laws that govern then, investigating relations, inventing new definitions, abstracting understood concepts, generalizing abstractions, further all the time, seeking universal was muss sein truths always and ever.


Mathematics studies
- quantity  - number theory
- structure - algebra
- space     - geometry
- change    - mathematical analysis





The development of mathematics is driven by the desire to
- invent new abstractions
- discover new generelizations
- generelize newly invented abstractions
- generelize newly discovered generelizations
