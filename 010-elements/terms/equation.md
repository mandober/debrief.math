# Equation

An equation is a *formula* of the form `A = B`, where `A` and `B` are *expressions* that may contain one or several *variables*, called *unknowns*, and "=" denotes the *equality* binary relation. Although written in the form of a *proposition*, an equation is not a *statement* (it doesn't have a truth value), but represents a problem that is to be solve by finding the values, called solutions, that, when substituted in for the unknowns, establishes the equality between the expressions on the left and right side, `A = B`. (For example, -42 is the unique solution, for x ∈ ℤ, of the equation "x ÷ 7 - 1 = x ÷ 6"). The same principle is encountered in the pure FPLs, which don't have assignment, so an expression like `sum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs` also establishes the equality between the left and right side, that can be made evident by repeatedly and consistently *substituting equals for equals*, in the process known as the *simplification*.

In mathematics, an equation is a formula that expresses the equality of two expressions, by relating them with the equals sign.


An equation is a problem of finding values of some variables, called unknowns, for which the specified equality is true. The term "equation" may also refer to an equality relation that is satisfied only for the values of the variables that one is interested in. For example, `x² + y² = 1` is the equation of the unit circle.

There is no standard notation that distinguishes an equation from an identity, or other use of the *equality relation*: one has to guess an appropriate interpretation from the semantics of expressions and the context.

An identity is asserted to be true for all values of variables in a given domain.

An "equation" may sometimes mean an identity, but more often than not, it specifies a subset of the variable space to be the subset where the equation is true.
