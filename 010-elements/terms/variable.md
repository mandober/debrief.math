In mathematics, a **variable** is a symbol that represents a mathematical object (number, vector, matrix, function, argument, set, element, etc.).

In algebra, equations with variables, used instead of concrete numbers, manage to represent a range of problems in a single expression. For example, the quadratic formula solves any quadratic equation by substituting the numeric values of the *coefficients* of that equation for the variables that represent them.

In mathematical logic, a variable is a symbol representing either an unspecified term of the enclosing theory (i.e. *metavariable*), or a basic object of the theory, that is manipulated without referring to its possible intuitive interpretation (manipulated purely symbolically).

## History

In ancient works such as Euclid's Elements, single letters refer to geometric points and shapes.

In the 7th century, Brahmagupta used different colours to represent the unknowns in algebraic equations in the Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta. One section of this book is called "Equations of Several Colours".

At the end of the 16th century, *François Viète* introduced the idea of representing known and unknown numbers by letters, nowadays called variables, as well as the idea of computing with them as if they were concrete numbers - in order to obtain the result by a simple replacement. Viète's convention was to use consonants for known values, and vowels for unknowns.

In 1637, René Descartes invented the convention of representing *unknowns* in equations by x, y, z, and *knowns* by a, b, c. Unlike Viète's convention, Descartes' convention survived.

Starting in the 1660s, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed the infinitesimal calculus, which essentially consists of studying how an infinitesimal variation of a variable quantity induces a corresponding variation of another quantity which is a function of the first variable.

Almost a century later, *Leonhard Euler* fixed the terminology of infinitesimal calculus, and introduced the notation `y = f(x)` for a function `f`, its variable `x` and its value `y`.

Until the end of the 19th century, the word "variable" referred almost exclusively to arguments and values of functions.

In the second half of the 19th century, it appeared that the foundation of infinitesimal calculus was not formalized enough to deal with apparent paradoxes such as a nowhere differentiable continuous function. To solve this problem, Karl Weierstrass introduced a new formalism consisting of replacing the intuitive notion of limit by a formal definition. The older notion of limit was "when the variable `x` varies and tends toward `a`, then `f(x)` tends toward `L`", without any accurate definition of "tending". Weierstrass replaced this sentence by the formula `(∀ϵ > 0)(∃η > 0) ∀x |x − a| < η ⇒ |L − f(x)|< ϵ`, in which none of the 5 variables is considered as *varying*.

This static formulation led to the *modern notion of variable*, which is simply a symbol representing a mathematical object that **either is unknown**, or **may be replaced by any element of a given set**.
