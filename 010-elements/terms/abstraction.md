# Math :: Elements :: Abstraction

**Abstraction** is the process by which the irrelevant details are removed in order to expose the underlying structure (essence).


Etymology
- from Middle English `abstraccyone`
- from Middle French `abstraction`
- from Latin `abstrāctiō` ("separation", "subtraction")
- from Latin `abstrahō` ("draw away"). Equivalent to `abstract` + `-ion`
- from Latin `ab-` ("away from") + `trahō` ("drag, haul")
- `trahō` (present infinitive `trahere`, perfect active `trāxī`, supine `tractum`); III conjugation

This justifies the use of the verb "to remove" above - inessential details are subtracted leaving only the essence.


*Abstraction* is a general concept reached by extracting the common features from a set of related examples (samples, individuals).

*Abstraction* is the process in which the details of a well-understood object are deliberately "forgotten" in order to simplify it and thenceforth regard the entity as a new, freestanding (independent of its parts) entity.

For example, an order pair has its set-theoretical definition in terms of sets `(a,b) ≝ {{a}, {a,b}}`. However, once the notion of ordered pairs is established, their set-theoretical origin is forgotten and they are regarded as standalone mathematical objects; upon encountering an ordered pair in a statement, nobody is (or should be) inclined to check whether its ocurrence agrees with its set-theoretical definition. The same is the case with natural numbers and their set-theoretical definition.

As the process of understanding a concept moves from the low-level details (that describes it thouroughly) towards the high-level view (that describes it in its totality), the concept necessarily gets simplified. 
*Abstraction* is the process of *extracting the essence* of a concept, and then *generalizing* it so it has the broadest application possible.

Among all the diverse fields of mathematics, category theory is the home of abstraction.
