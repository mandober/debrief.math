# Mathematics in brief

* Ancient Greeks are always mentioned, but many other cultures, at least Chinese, Persian, Babylonian, Arabic, Indian, should also be mentioned when discussing the initiation of mathematics. Ancient Greeks were proper obsesed with numbers and infinity, especially the Pythagorean cult.
* Nothing happend during the middle ages except burning a bunch of scientist and other infidels on a stake, along with anyone else who didn't comply with the church, let alone tried to advance the secular progress from a dead halt.
* Basically, number theory and geometry seemed to peek everybody's interest for a very long time, and geometry was about to take a hit. Sporadically, sure, there were ideas, considered as the inceptions of what will later develop into standalone mathematical fields.
* In the centuries leading up to the exciting events that kicked off at the end of the XIX century, rudiments of many mathematical fields were founded, with the Renaissance marking the breakaway from the church's grasp and the change in thinking that finally managed to push the progress forward.

* The XIX century's development of formalism was still awaited on to provide the tools and vocabulary toward the proper formalization of math theories, despite Euclid's early (~ IV century BCE) meticulous presentation on how to seriously carry out mathematical proofs. Euclid's examplary effert stood strong for centuries, millenias even, and was used as a textbook when universities were invented. Trivia: Euclid's `Elements` is the second most published book of all times. Hint for the first most published book ever: it contributed to the millenias long economic, intellectual and cultural decline, known as the Dark Ages.

* Geometry was about to take a hit
* Actually it was exaclty Euclid and his holier-than-thou postulates that made the boat rock - primarily, the Euclid's 5th about parallel lines.

## Timeline

* *Classical antiquity* is the period 8th BCE - 6th CE century, centred around the Mediterranean sea and comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, known as the Greco-Roman world.

* *Late antiquity* is the time of transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages, generally spanning the 4-6 century in Europe.

* Middle Ages

- Early Middle Ages
- Dark Ages
- Late Middle Ages

* Renaissance

*The Age of Enlightenment*, or the Enlightenment, was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries with global influences and effects. Many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the value of human happiness, the pursuit of knowledge obtained by means of reason and the evidence of the senses, and ideals such as liberty, progress, toleration, fraternity, and constitutional government. *Neoclassicism*.

*The Romanticism*: late 18th and early 19th century. *Gothic*
