# Strong induction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_induction

**Strong induction** uses a stronger hypothesis thus making the inductive step easier to prove. Normally, inductive hypothesis allows us to assume `Pn -> P(Sn)`, 

while stronk induction allows us to assume that `P(S n)` under the assumption that `P(n)` holds for all natural numbers `n` that are less than `m + 1`.

by contrast, 

The name "strong induction" does not mean that this method can prove more than "weak induction", but merely refers to the stronger hypothesis used in the inductive step.
