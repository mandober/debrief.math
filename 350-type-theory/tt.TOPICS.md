# Type Theory: TOPICS

Basic concepts
- type
- term
- value

Type theories
  - Major
    - Homotopy type theory
    - Intuitionistic type theory
    - Martin-lof type theory
    - simply typed lambda calculus (which is a higher-order logic)
    - intuitionistic type theory
    - system F
    - LF is often used to define other type theories
    - calculus of constructions and its derivatives
  - Minor
    - Automath
    - ST type theory
    - UTT (Luo's Unified Theory of dependent Types)
    - some forms of combinatory logic
    - others defined in the lambda cube
    - others under the name typed lambda calculus
    - others under the name pure type system
