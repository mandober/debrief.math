## About the series
In this series we develop an understanding of the modern foundations of pure mathematics, starting from first principles. We start with set theory, then learn about category theory, logic and type theory, until we are in a position to understand dependent type theory, and in particular, homotopy type theory. HoTT later promises to replace set theory as the foundation of modern mathematics. We also study theoretical computer science, particularly theory of programming languages, and the design of programming languages in which it would be possible to formalize mathematics.
