Type theory was initially created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of *formal logics* and *rewrite systems*. Later, type theory referred to a class of formal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives to naive set theory as a foundation of mathematics. Type theory has been tied to formal mathematics since `Principia Mathematica` and it is a very active field today, especially through the development of *proof assistants*.
