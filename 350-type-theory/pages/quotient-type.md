# Quotient type

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_type

In type theory, a quotient type is an *algebraic data type* that represents a type whose equality relation has been redefined by a given equivalence relation such that the elements of the type are partitioned into a set of equivalence classes whose cardinality is LE (less than or equal to) that of the base type.

Just as product types are analogous to the cartesian product, and sum types are analogous to the disjoint unions, quotient types are analogous to the concept of set-theoretic quotients.

>A quotient set is a set equipped with an equivalence relation that surjectively partitions its elements into equivalence classes.

Algebraic structures with a quotient set as the carrier are also called "quotients". Examples of such quotient structures include quotient spaces (in topology), quotient sets, quotient groups, quotient rings, quotient categories.

In a type theory that lacks quotient types, *setoids* (sets explicitly equipped with an equivalence relation) are often used instead.
