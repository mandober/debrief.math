## Idea

*Per Martin-Löf's dependent type theory*, also known as *intuitionistic type theory* [Martin-Löf-75], or *constructive type theory*, is a specific form of type theory developed to support constructive mathematics.

Note that both "dependent type theory" and "intuitionistic type theory" may refer more generally to type theories that contain dependent types or are intuitionistic, respectively.

Martin-Löf's dependent type theory is notable for several reasons:

* One can construct an interpretation of first-order intuitionistic logic by interpreting __propositions as types__ (this is true of most any dependent type theory).

* It has a version of a variant of the Axiom of Choice as a theorem (because of the properties of the above interpretation).

* In its intensional form, it has sufficient computational content to function as a programming language. At the same time, it then has identity types whose presence shows that one is really dealing with a form of homotopy type theory.
