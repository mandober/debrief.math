# Type Theory: RANT

TT started when the paradox related to self-reference arouse in naive set theory. Types were introduced to classify things by slapping each with a label such that a container cannot be mixed up with a containee ever again. The types were stratified so even the types had types. And if a type has a type, then there's no end in sight.

It was a rank-based hierarchy of types that went on as high as needed. Something of type ank n could only be contained in something of, at least, type rank n+1. Specifically, any container of type rank n was strictly prohibited to contain itself or anything else of the same type rank as itself.

that the types formed an infinite hierarchy: basic elements were type-0, and the type of type0 thing was type1, which was of type2, etc. The type of type-n was type-(n+1) and the type of container thing was always, at least one rank, higher then any contained thing.


the ur-elements (things that could not contain other things) had a type 0; the type 1 thing could only contain type 0 things.
