# Index of Judgements

Most type theories have these judgements:
- `Γ` is a well-defined context,  `Γ ctx`
- `T` is a well-defined type,     `Γ |- T type`
- `t` is a term of type `T`,      `Γ |- t : T`
- type `T` is equal to type `R`,  `Γ |- T ≡ R`
- terms `t` and `u` of type `T` are equal, `Γ |- t ≡ u : T`
