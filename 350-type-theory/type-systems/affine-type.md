# Affine type

Rust has the concept of *ownership types* (affine types and affine logic), which means that any value object in memory has a principle owner, which holds the exclusive (read, write, loan) rights over the object. Its right to loan the object makes that object available to other parties, but with the tight restrictions over the access mode. That is, an object can be borrowed mutabaly exactly once, or it can be borrowed in a read-only mode any number of times. Therefore, at any time, any object has either at most one active writeable reference, or any number XOR readable references. The exclusive disjunction (XOR) empasizes the guarantee that the object cannot be observed by other parties while it is undergoing changes; while the exclusive writeable permission is in effect (in scope), there are no readers around (no reading is allowed). This strategy has proved very efficent in preventing a whole slew of issues, from dangling pointers to iterator invalidation. Along with the concept of *lifetime* of the borrowed references, it makes a strong system for managing mutation and providing RAII.
