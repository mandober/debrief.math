# Relations ∷ Notations




Image of a relation is a subset of the relation's codomain
- Image of a relation , `Im(G) = { b | (a,b) ∈ G, a ∈ A, b ∈ B }`
- Images under `R` relation: `Images(x)` = all elements `b ∈ B` where `xRb`
- `Im(a) = { b | aRb }`

Preimage of a relation is a subset of the relation's domain
- Preimage of a relation , `Pre(G) = { a | (a,b) ∈ G, a ∈ A, b ∈ B }`
- Preimages under `R` relation: `Images(y)` = all elements `a ∈ B` where `aRy`
- `Pre(b) = { a | aRb }`
