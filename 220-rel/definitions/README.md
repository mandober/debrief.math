## Notes

* A relation cannot be both reflexive and irreflexive as these two properties are mutually exclusive. It is possible for a relation to be neither reflexive nor irreflexive.

* Antisymmetry is not the opposite of symmetry. It is possible for a relation to be both symmetric and antisymmetric. It is also possible for a relation to be both non-symmetric and non-antisymmetric.
