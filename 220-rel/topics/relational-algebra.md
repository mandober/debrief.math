(not to be confused with Relation algebra)

In database theory, relational algebra is a theory that uses algebraic structures with a well-founded semantics for modeling data, and defining queries on it.

The theory was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in his paper "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks" from 1970. *Codd's theorem*, a result proven in his seminal work on the relational model, equates the expressive power of relational algebra and relational calculus. Codd received the Turing Award in 1981.

The main application of relational algebra is to provide a theoretical foundation for relational databases, particularly query languages for such databases, chief among which is SQL. Relational databases store tabular data represented as relations. Queries over relational databases often likewise return tabular data represented as relations.

The main premise of the relational algebra is to define operators that transform one or more input relations to an output relation. Given that these operators accept relations as input and produce relations as output, they can be combined and used to express potentially complex queries that transform potentially many input relations (whose data are stored in the database) into a single output relation (the query results).

Unary operators accept as input a single relation; examples include operators to filter certain attributes (columns) or tuples (rows) from an input relation.

Binary operators accept as input two relations; such operators combine the two input relations into a single output relation by, for example, taking all tuples found in either relation, removing tuples from the first relation found in the second relation, extending the tuples of the first relation with tuples in the second relation matching certain conditions, and so forth.

Other more advanced operators can also be included, where the inclusion or exclusion of certain operators gives rise to a family of algebras.
