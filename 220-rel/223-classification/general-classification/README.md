# Relations :: Classification :: General classification

The **general classification** explores the general factors of division, that often occur as opposing pairs, and classify relations in broad, mostly bipolar, classes according to their homogeneity, finiteness, arity, etc.

General classification
- finitary relations
- infinitary relations
- homogeneous relations (endorelations)
- heterogeneous relations (exorelations)
- binary relations
- ternary relations
- n-ary relations


Factors of general classification
- by finiteness (finitary, infinitary)
- by homogenity (homogeneous, heterogeneous)
- by arity
- by directionality
- by variance (dependency, implication among relations)
- by comparability
- by atomicity (atomic vs compound relations)


Opposing pairs of factors
- finitary vs infinitary relations
- homogeneous vs heterogeneous relations
- atomic vs compound relations
