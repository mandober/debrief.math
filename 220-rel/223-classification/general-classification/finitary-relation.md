# Finitary relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation

A **finitary relation** over sets `X₁, …, Xₙ`, 
is a subset of the Cartesian product `X₁ ⨯ ⋯ ⨯ Xₙ`.
That is, it is a set of `n`-tuples, `(x₁, ⋯, xₙ)`, 
consisting of elements `xᵢ ∈ Xᵢ`.

A relation typically represents an association between the tuple's elements. For example, a relation "`x` is divisible by `y` and `z`", `y+z|x`, consists of a set of 3-tuples, such that when substituted to `x`, `y` and `z`, respectively, make the sentence true.
