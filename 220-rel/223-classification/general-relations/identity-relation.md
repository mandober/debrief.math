# Relations :: Classification :: General relations :: Identity relation

**Identity relation** is always possible when relating a nonempty set to itself.
- it is an endorelation, it is a relation on a single set
- it exists if the set is not empty

Any relation `R` on a set `A` is a subset of the Cartesian product `A⨯A`, i.e. `R ⊆ A²`. Identity relation `I` is an endorelation on a single set, `I ⊆ A²`, that relates each element of the set with itself:

`I ⊆ A². I = { (x,x) | x ∈ A }`


Identity relation is reflexive.

Reflexivity is a relation on a single set
 
A relation is reflexive is each element
