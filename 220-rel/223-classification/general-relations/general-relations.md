# Relations :: Classification :: General relations :: General relations

In classifying relations, *general relations* form their own class of relations since these 3 relations may almost always be admittable when relating sets.
1. Universal relation
2. Identity relation
3. Empty relation

In fact, the only relation that is guaranteed to always be available, no matter how many sets and which kinds of sets are related, is the empty relation.



If `R` is a relation betwen sets `A` and `B`, i.e. `R ⊆ A⨯B` then:

**The Universal relation** `U`, on a set (or between two or more sets) is potentially always possible, and it is equal to the Cartesian product.

`U = A⨯B`
