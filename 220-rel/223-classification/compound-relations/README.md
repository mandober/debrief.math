# Relations :: Classification :: Compound relations

In classifying relations, atomic relations refer to a single-property relations, as opposed to *compound relations* that combine several atomic relations into one. Ordering relation have their own class/folder, so they will be only mentioned here but analysed there; and the same is true for equivalence relation. (In fact, orders are explored in a separate section, `order theory`, so this section, `relations` only considers ordering relations as far as relations go).

Compound relations:
- equivalence relation (refl, sym, trans)
- apartness relation (irreflex + symm + cotrans)
- Ordering relations
  - preorder (sym, trans)
  - partial order (irrefl, sym, trans)
  - total order (refl, sym, trans, totality)
