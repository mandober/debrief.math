# Relations :: Classification :: Atomic :: Elementary

In classifying relations, *atomic relations* refer to a single-property relations (e.g. refl), as opposed to compound relations (e.g. equivalence relation is a set of 3 atomic relations: refl, sym, trans). *Elementary relations* are atomic relations based on the 3 elementary relations (Reflexivity, Symmetry and Transitivity) along with their derivatives.


Atomic relations
- Reflexivity-based
  - reflexive relation
  - irreflexive relation
  - coreflexive relation
  - quasireflexive
    - left quasireflexive
    - right quasireflexive
- Symmetry-based
  - symmetric
  - antisymmetric
  - asymmetric
- Transitivity-based
  - transitive
  - intransitive
  - quasitransitive
    - left quasitransitive
    - right quasitransitive
  - dense
  - transitively incomparable
  - incomparability-transitive
- Other atomic relations
  - Euclidean relation
