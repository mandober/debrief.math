# Relations :: Classification :: Atomic :: Elementary relations

In classifying relations, *atomic relations* refer to a single-property relations, as opposed to *compound relations*.

*Elementary relations* are atomic relations that include the 3 most fundamental relations (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity) and their derivatives.

Elementary relations:
- reflexivity
- symmetry
- transitivity

Elementary relations and their derivatives:
- *Reflexivity-based*
  - reflexive relation
  - irreflexive relation
  - coreflexive relation
  - quasireflexive
    - left quasireflexive
    - right quasireflexive
- *Symmetry-based*
  - symmetric
  - antisymmetric
  - asymmetric
- *Transitivity-based*
  - transitive
  - intransitive
  - quasitransitive
    - left quasitransitive
    - right quasitransitive
  - transitively incomparable
  - incomparability-transitive
  - dense
