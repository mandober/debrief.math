# Reflexivity

Reflexivity is a property that a relation may have. Such is a reflexive relation. Unlike other properties, reflexivity requires that each element of the domain set is associated to itself. Whether a relation has any additional associations, apart from the identity pairs, is immaterial.

An ordered pair has the form `(x,y)`, and an identity pair the form `(x,x)`. So, a relation `R` on a set `A` is *reflexive* if for all elements, `a`, in `A`, there is an identity pair, `(a,a)`, in `R`, i.e. `∀a(a ∈ A -> (a,a) ∈ R)`.

A relation `R` on a set `A` comprised exactly of all the idenity pairs, such that each element in `A` is represented by an identity pair in `R` is an *identity relation*.

A relation is *coreflexive* if it contains only the identity pairs - it may contain no elements, but if it does, they must all be of the form `(a,a)`. However, unlike an identity relation, a coreflexive relation on a set `A` need not contain all such pairs.

If we have a set `A = {1,2}` than these relations on `A`
1. R = ∅
2. R = { (1,1) }
3. R = { (2,2) }
4. R = { (1,1), (2,2) }
5. R = { (1,2) }
5. R = { (2,1) }
5. R = { (1,2), (2,1) }

R 1 2
1 a b
2 c d


R is the empty relation
- coreflexive
- the identity relation
