# Relation theory :: Hierarchy

* Relations (general)
  - Concept of relations
  - Representation of relations
  - Notation of relations
  - Presentation of relations
  - Definition of relations
  - Relations in terms of
    - associations
    - ordered pairs
    - tuples
    - sets
    - set product

* Operations on relations
  * set operations
    - union
    - disjoint union
    - intersection
    - relative difference
    - partitioning
    - complementation
    - set product
    - powerset
  * relation-specifiec operations
    - complementation
    - composition
    - transposition
    - restriction of a domain

* Classification of relations
    - heterogeneous relations
    - homogeneous relation
  * by cardinality
    - finitary relation
    - infinitary relation
    - empty relation
  * by arity
    - unary relation (property)
    - binary relation (predicate)
    - k-ary for some fixed integer k
    - n-ary for some arbitrary integer n
  * by properties
    - refl
    - symm


* Relation types
  * Special relations
    - null (empty) relation
    - universal (total) relation
    - identity relation
  * Produced by an operation
    - complementary relation
    - restricted relation
    - converse relation

* Relation properties
  * Properties I: Basic properties
    * Reflexivity
      - reflexive
      - coreflexive
      - quasireflexive
      - irreflexive (antireflexive, aliorelative)
      - non-reflexive
      - non-irreflexive
    * Symmetry
      - symmetric relation
      - antisymmetric relation
      - asymmetric relation
    * Transitivity
      - transitive relation
      - intransitive (antitransitive) relation
      - quasi-transitive relation
        - left quasi-transitive relation
        - right quasi-transitive relation
  * Function-like properties
    - functional, right-unique, right-definite, univalent
    - serial relation, left-total
    - injective relation
    - surjective relation
  * Properties II
    - Euclidean relation
      - left Euclidean relation
      - right Euclidean relation
    - dichotomous relation
    - trichotomous relation
    - connected, total
    - strongly-connected
  * Properties III
    * Reflexivity
      - reflexivity
      - non-reflexivity
      - irreflexivity, antireflexivity
      - quasireflexivity
        - left quasireflexivity
        - right quasireflexivity
      - coreflexivity
    * Symmetry
      - symmetry
      - asymmetry
      - antisymmetry
    * Transitivity
      - transitivity
      - antitransitivity
    - uniqueness
    - injectivity
    - surjectivity
    - dichotomy
    - trichotomy

* Representing relations
  - table
  - diagramm
  - matrix of rows тип cols indexed by elements
  - logical matrix, 1 if (row, col) elements are related; else 0
  - directed or undirected graph
  - coordinate system: each ord pair (x,y) is a point

* Recurrence relations
  - Mathematical induction
  - Strong Induction
  - Linear recurrence relations
  - Non-homogeneous recurrence relation
  - Generating functions


* Closures
  - Reflexive closure
  - Symmetric closure
  - Transitive closure
  - Binary relation closures
  - P closures of binary relations
