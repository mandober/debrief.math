Directionality


Mathematics models a relation between two objects as an ordered pair which contains the notion of directionality. 

The notion of relation is a mathematical concept that subsumes the notion of function - all functions are relations (but not vice versa).

Directionality is an intrinsic property of a relation - all relations (directional or not) may be modelled with directed relations (undirected associations will duplicate the information, but that's a different concern). For this reason, the mathematical model of relations (mathematical object chosen to encode relations) must suppport encoding directionality.

In fact, since set theory was (particularly at the time this topic was peaking) and still is, the foundational theory of math, the choice of object to model relations is already decided.

The main problems of representing relations using just sets is that relations have the *notion of directionality* - an object A related to an object B does not imply that B is related to A. The notion of direction is the primitive aspect of a relation - all relations can safely be thought of as being directed - directed relations can easily represent the undirected ones (but not vice versa). Another issue with the requirement to use sets, is that they are structures completely oblivious to the potential duplicity of their elements. This becomes a factor when we consider an important property of relations - that an *object may be related to itelf*!
