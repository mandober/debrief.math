# Relations :: Basics :: Notation

A relation is generically denoted by `R`, and when a pair of elements `(x, y)` is an element of the relation `R`, i.e. when `R` holds for a pair `(x, y)`, then this may be denoted by:
- `xRy`
- `R(x,y)`
- `(x, y) ∈ R`

If this pair is not in the relation:
- `x¬Ry` or `¬(xRy)`
- `¬R(x,y)`
- `(x, y) ∉ R` or `¬((x, y) ∈ R)`

Some relations are so common that they have been given *own name and symbol*, like the "less then or equal" relation symbolized by `≤`. 

If `≤` holds for a pair `(x, y)`
- `x ≤ y`
- `≤(x, y)`
- `(x,y) ∈ ≤`

If `≤` does not hold for a pair `(x, y)`
- `x ≰  y`
- `¬(x ≤ y)`
- `¬≤(x,y)`
- `(x,y) ∉ ≤`
