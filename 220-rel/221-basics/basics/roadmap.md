## Relation
https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics)

Due to the convergence of many traditions of study, there are wide variations in the language used to describe relations. The **extensional** approach (presented in this article) treats a relation as the set-theoretic extension of a *relational concept or term*. An alternative, **intensional** approach reserves the term "relation" to the corresponding logical entity, either the *logical comprehension* (the totality of intensions or abstract properties that all the elements of the extensional relation have in common), or the symbols that denote those elements and intensions.


## Relative term
https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Relative_term

A relative term is a logical term that requires reference to any number of other objects, called the correlates of the term, in order to denote a definite object, called the relate1 of the relative term in question.  A relative term is typically expressed in ordinary language by means of a phrase with explicit or implicit blanks, for example, "lover of __", or "giver of __ to __".
