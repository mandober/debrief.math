# Relations :: Terminology :: Image of relation

Given a full definition of a relation `R` as the tuple `(A, G, B)`, with the graph of the relation `G ⊆ A⨯B`, the image of the relation is the set of all elements `b ∈ B` that participate in the relation, i.e. in the graph of the relation that is the set of ordered pairs.

`Img(R) = { b | (a,b) ∈ G ⋀ a ∈ A ⋀ b ∈ B }`
