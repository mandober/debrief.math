# Relations in semantics

- reference
- referent
- referrer
- referral


A **reference** is a *relation* in which an entity (object, symbol, concept, word, person) signifies something, and a **referent** is the thing signified.

A **referral** is a realization of a reference, often in form of writen or spoken communication. A referral is also the act of referring, and it may denote the actual entity (e.g. a person) that is being referred, or something more abstract (like a set of actions).

A **referring expression** - an expression (a phrase or a surrogate) functioning to identify an individual object.


In fields such as semantics, semiotics, and theory of reference, a distinction is made between a referent and a reference.

It is pointed out that *reference* may be a psychological process, and that *referents* themselves may be psychological - existing only in the imagination of the *referrer*, and not necessarily in the real world (for further ideas related to this observation, see *failure to refer*).
