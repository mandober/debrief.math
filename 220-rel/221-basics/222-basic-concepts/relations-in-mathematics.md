# Relations :: Basic concepts :: Relations in mathematics

* If A = {1,2} and B = {3,4}, then {(1,3), (1,4)} is a relation from A to B.
* In general, a relation can be represented as a multi-valued function.

A binary relation is a set of ordered pairs, which poses the first challenge:
>The definition of ordered pairs in terms of sets. 
However, since ordered pairs are first encountered in set theory when introducing Cartesian product, the ensuing discussion is located there. We'll just repeat here that the most common definition of an ordered pair is the *Kuratowski pair*, `(x,y) := {{x}, {{x,y}}}`, the fact which is already forgotton in this section - we get to use them as standalone, bona fide mathematical objects here. This is acceptable practice, not just with ordered pairs but with sets in general. Even though set theory is admitted as the foundational theory of mathematics and thereby is the elementary theory in terms of which the entirety of math can be derived, majority of mathematicians are not particularly interested in doing so, being content that, in principle, it can be done if push come to shove. On the other hand, some mathematicians would like nothing better but to take a giant shit on all theories that admit the principle of excluded middle, with set theory on top, deeming them unconstructive two bob cunts. How is this related to relations? Because, "related".

Binary relations are the most common and most easily understood, but they may be generalized in a couple of dimensions.
