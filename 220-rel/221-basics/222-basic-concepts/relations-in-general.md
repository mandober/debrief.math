## Relations in philosophy

In philosophy, relations are ways in which objects, the *relata* (sg. relatum), stand to each other.

Relations are in many ways similar to *properties* in that both characterize the object they apply to. Properties are sometimes even treated as a special case of relations that only involves a single *relatum*.

Relations are *ontological components*. Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the ontology language in which they are expressed. Most ontologies describe *instances* (individuals), *classes* (concepts), *attributes* and *relations*.

In metaphysics, *theories of relations* are typically introduced to account for repetitions of how several things stand to each other.

**Relativism** is a philosophical views which *denies objectivity* within a particular domain and asserts that valuations are relative to the observer's perspective or context.

**Relationalism** is any theoretical position that gives importance to the relational nature of things - things exist and function only as relational entities. Relationalism as a theory of reality interprets the existence, nature, and meaning of things in terms of their *relationality* or *relatedness*. In relationalist view, things are neither self-standing entities nor vague events but *relational particulars*.

**Relationism** which tends to emphasize relations per se, may be contrasted with Relationalism.

## Relations in sociology

In relational sociology, Relationalism is often contrasted with *Substantialism*. While Substantialism tends to view individuals as self-subsistent entities capable of social interaction, Relationalism underscores the social human practices and the individual's transactional contexts and reciprocal relations.

## Relations in physics

More generally, in physics and philosophy, a **relational theory** is a framework to understand reality or a physical system in such a way that the positions and other properties of objects are only meaningful relative to other objects.

## Relations in logic

The treatment of unary relations as properties in philosophy especially carries over to logic, where properties are usually viewed as one-place relations or predicates. Even nullary relations are often understood as constants (zero-place predicates), such as the Bolean constants 'true' and 'false'. Though the terms "predicate" and "relation" are synonyms, the former is usually reserved for binary relations, while the latter refers to relations of bigger arity.

In logic, a relatum is a term in a proposition that is related to the referent of the proposition - that is, a relatum is one of the objects between which a relation is said to hold.


## Relations in general


Relations are found everywhere. Relations are ways in which objects, the relata, stand to each other.

Intuitively, the notion of relation denotes the existence of some kind of connection or association between objects.

A relation is an abstraction belonging to two entities together. A relation is a common abstract or concerete characteristic of two entities.

A relation is a logical or natural association between things that stand in relevance to one to another.

In mathematics, a relation is an association between objects. 
A relation is an association between ordered pairs of objects. 
A relation is a set of ordered pairs whose members have such an association.

A relation is a correspondence (association) between two sets, consisting of a set of ordered pairs, the first element of each of which is from the first set, and the second element of each of which is from the second set.

A relation is a property that associates two quantities in a definite order, as equality or inequality.

A relation is an association that necessarily holds between its relata.
