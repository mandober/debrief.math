# Equivalence relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation

An equivalence relation is a binary relation that is
- reflexive,  `∀a ∈ A. a𝓡a`
- symmetric,  `∀ab ∈ A. a𝓡b <-> b𝓡a`
- transitive, `∀abc ∈ A. a𝓡b ⋀ b𝓡c -> a𝓡c`

The canonical example of an equivalence relation is the equality, i.e. the is-equal-to, EQ, relation denoted by `=`.

Each equivalence relation partitions the underlying set into disjoint *equivalence classes*. Two elements of a given set are equivalent to each other iff they belong to the same equivalence class.
