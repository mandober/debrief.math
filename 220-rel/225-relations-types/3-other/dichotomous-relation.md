# Dichotomous relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy

A dichotomous relation `R` is such that either `aRb` or `bRa`.

`∀x,y ∈ X. xRy ⊕ yRx`

In classic logic, *the law of excluded middle*  asserts the existence of a dichotomy: statements are either true or false, not both (and not neither).


## Dichotomy

A dichotomy is a partition of a set into two subsets such that the subsets are
- jointly exhaustive: everything must belong to one part or the other
- mutually exclusive: nothing can belong simultaneously to both parts

Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition.

The two parts thus formed are complements. In logic, the partitions are opposites if there exists a proposition such that it holds over one and not the other.

Treating continuous variables or multicategorical variables as binary variables is called dichotomization. The discretization error inherent in dichotomization is temporarily ignored for modeling purposes.
