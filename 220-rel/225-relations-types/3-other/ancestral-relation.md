# Ancestral relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_relation

In mathematical logic, the **ancestral relation** of a binary relation `R` is its transitive closure, however defined in a different way, see below.

Ancestral relations make their first appearance in Frege's "Begriffsschrift". Frege later employed them in his "Grundgesetze" as part of his definition of the finite cardinals. Hence the ancestral was a key part of his search for a logicist foundation of arithmetic.

## Definition

The numbered propositions below are taken from Frege's `Begriffsschrift` and recast in contemporary notation.

A property `P` is called `R`-*hereditary* if, whenever `x` is `P` and `xRy` holds, then `y` is also `P`: `(Px â‹€ xRy) -> Py`
