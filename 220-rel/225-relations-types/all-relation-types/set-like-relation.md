# Set-like relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-like_relation


Set-like or local relation: for all x âˆˆ X, the class of all `y` such that `yRx` is a set, which makes sense only if relations over proper classes are allowed.
For example, the usual ordering `<` over the class of ordinal numbers is a set-like relation, while its inverse (>) is not.
