# Partial equivalence relation


A partial equivalence relation (PER) `R` on a set `X` is a relation that is _symmetric_ and _transitive_.

It holds for all `a, b, c âˆˆ X` that:
1. if `aRb`, then `bRa` (symmetry)
2. if `aRb` and `bRc`, then `aRc` (transitivity)

If `R` is also reflexive, then `R` is an equivalence relation.
