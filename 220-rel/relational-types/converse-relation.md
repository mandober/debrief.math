# Converse relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_relation

The **converse relation** (transpose), `Rᵀ`, of a binary relation `R` is the relation that occurs when the order of the components in the set of ordered pairs is swapped.

R ⊆ A ⨯ B
R : A ⨯ B
(a, b) : A ⨯ B
(a, b) ∈ A ⨯ B
(a, b) ∈ R


R  = { (x,y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B }
R  = { (x,y) ∈ A ⨯ B | x ∈ A, y ∈ B }

Rᵀ = { (y,x) ∈ Y ⨯ X | (x,y) ∈ R }
