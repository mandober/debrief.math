# Symmetric relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation


`a𝓡b <-> b𝓡a`
`(a,b) ∈ R <-> (b,a) ∈ R`



  - asymmetric:
    `(x,y) ∈ R ∧ (y,x) ∈ R <-> x ≠ y`
    - antysymmetric tolerates mirrired pairs (a,b) ~ (b,a) as long as a ≠ b
    i.e. as long as they have distinct components, (a,b)
    - no pairs that make up the diagonal
    - allows mirrored pairs but not (a,a)
    - `<` is asymmetric
