# Restriction of relations

- if R is a binary homogeneous relation over a set X, `R ⊆ X²`, 
  and S is a subset of X, `S ⊆ X`, then 
  `R╷ₛ = { (x,y) | x𝓡y ⋀ x ∈ 𝓢 ⋀ y ∈ 𝓢 }` 
  is the *restriction relation* of R to S over X.

- if R is a binary relation over sets X 
  and Y and if S is a subset of X then 
  `R╷ₛ = { (x,y) | x𝓡y ⋀ x ∈ 𝓢 }` 
  is the *left-restriction relation* of R to S over X and Y.

- if R is a binary relation over sets X 
  and Y and if S is a subset of X then 
  `R╵ˢ = { (x,y) | x𝓡y ⋀ y ∈ 𝓢 }`
  is the *right-restriction relation* of R to S over X and Y.
