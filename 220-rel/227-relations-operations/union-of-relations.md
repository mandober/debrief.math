# Union of relations

If 𝓡 and 𝓢 are binary relations over sets X and Y then `𝓡 ⋃ 𝓢` 
is the union of relations 𝓡 and 𝓢 over X and Y:   
`𝓡 ⋃ 𝓢 = { (x,y) | x𝓡y ⋁ x𝓢y }` i.e.   
`𝓡 ⋃ 𝓢 = { (x,y) | (x,y) ∈ 𝓡 ⋁ (x,y) ∈ 𝓢 }`

The identity element is the empty (null) relation.

Examples of union of relations
- `(<) ⋃ (=) = (<=)`, i.e. LT ⋃ EQ = LE
- `(>) ⋃ (=) = (>=)`, i.e. GT ⋃ EQ = GE
- `(⊂) ⋃ (=) = (⊆)`
- `(⊃) ⋃ (=) = (⊇)`
