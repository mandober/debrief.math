# Relations (philosophy)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_(philosophy)

>Relations are ways in which things, the relata, stand to each other.

Relations are in many ways similar to *properties* in that both characterize the things they apply to. Properties are sometimes treated as a special case of relations involving only one relatum.

In philosophy (especially metaphysics), *theories of relations* are typically introduced to account for repetitions of how several things stand to each other.

## Overview

The concept of relation has a long and complicated history.

One of the interests for the Greek philosophers lay in the number of ways in which a particular thing might be described, and the establishment of a relation between one thing and another was one of these.

A second interest lay in the difference between these relations and the things themselves. This was to culminate in the view that the things in themselves could not be known except through their relations. Debates similar to these continue into modern philosophy and include further investigations into types of relation and whether relations exist only in the mind or the real world or both.

An understanding of types of relation is important to an understanding of relations between many things including those between people, communities and the wider world. 

Most of these are complex relations but of the simpler, analytical relations out of which they are formed there are sometimes held to be three types, although opinion on the number may differ.

The three types are
1. *spatial relations*, which include geometry and number
2. *relations of cause and effect*
3. *classificatory relations of similarity and difference* that underlie knowledge.

Similar classifications have been suggested in the sciences, mathematics, and the arts.

In 1994's "Categories and Relators", J. Perreault talks about
- ordinal relations (e.g. dimensions)
- determinative relations (e.g. activities)
- subsumptive relations (e.g. types and kinds)

In 1971's "Structuralism", J. Piaget refers to the mathematicians, Nicolas Bourbaki, using
- topological structures (derived from geometrical relations)
- order structures (from predecessor-successor relations)
- algebraic structures (including sets and sub-sets)

In 1963's, "Intentions in Architecture" by C. Norberg-Schulz, besides headings
- Form (geometrical and spatial relations)
- Building Task (functional relations)
- Semantics (relations of meaning)
the book also refers to Charles W. Morris's division of *semiology* into
- syntactics (formal relation of signs)
- pragmatics (use and effect of signs)
- semantics (the relation between the sign and reality)

## Internal and external relations

An important distinction is between internal and external relations.

**Internal relations** are fully determined by the features of its relata. For example, an apple and a tomato stand in the internal relation of similarity to each other because they are both red. Some philosophers have inferred from this that internal relations do not have a proper ontological status since they can be reduced to *intrinsic properties*.

**External relations**, on the other hand, are not fixed by the features of their relata. For example, a book stands in an external relation to a table by lying on top of it. But this is not determined by the book's or the table's features (like their color, shape, etc). One problem associated with external relations is that they are difficult to locate. For example, the "lying-on-top" is located neither in the table nor in the apple. This has prompted some philosophers to deny that there are external relations. Properties do not face this problem since they are located in their bearer.

## History

Traditionally the history of the concept of relation begins with *Aristotle* and his concept of relative terms.

In Britain, John *Locke*, influenced by Isaac Newton and the laws of motion, developed a similar mechanistic view of the human mind. Following *Hobbes*'s notion of "trains of thought" where one idea naturally follows another in the mind, Locke developed further the concept of *knowledge as the perception of relations between ideas*. These relations included mathematical relations, scientific relations such as co-existence and succession, and the relations of identity and difference.

It was left to the Scottish philosopher David *Hume* to reduce these kinds of mental association to three: "To me there appears to be only three principles of connexion among ideas namely Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause or Effect".

The problem which troubled Hume of being able to establish the reality of relations from experience, in particular the relation of cause and effect, was solved in another way by Immanuel *Kant* who took the view that our knowledge is only partly derived from the external world. Part of our knowledge he argued must be due to the modifying nature of our own minds which imposes on perception not only the forms of space and time but also the categories of relation which he understood to be a priori concepts contained within the understanding. Of these he famously said: "Everything in our knowledge... contains nothing but mere relations".
