# Relations ∷ Types of relations ∷ Index of formulas

Index of binary relations expressed in a first-order language.

In most cases, each of these names signifies both the type of a relation and the corresponding property. So, a relation with the property of reflexivity is a reflexive relation.

Some properties have a slightly wider, more general meaning, often leaving small "wiggle room" that can give rise to a set of different but closely-related versions of some property. The set of members of such a "family" manifest different

Relations
- reflexive:                   aRa
- irreflexive (antireflexive) ¬aRa
- coreflexive
- symmetric relation:         aRb ⟺  bRa
- asymmetric relation:        aRb ⟺ ¬bRa
- antisymmetric relation:     (aRb ⋀ bRa) -> a = b
- transitive relation:        (aRb ⋀ bRc) ->  aRc
- antitransitive relation:    (aRb ⋀ bRc) -> ¬aRc
- strongly-connected (total): aRb ⋁ bRa
- connected relation:         aRb ⋁ bRa ⋁ a = b  ≡  (a ≠ b) -> (aRb ⋁ bRa)
