# Relations :: Definitions :: Connected relation

A relation `R` on a set `X` has the property of *connectedness*, or is said to be *connected* if

`∀x,y ∈ X. x ≠ y ⋁ yRx`

(Note the universal quantifer!)

Or, equivalently,

`∀x,y ∈ X. xRy ⋁ yRx ⋁ x = y`

That is, any two elements in a set X are either related (in one way or the other, meaning `xRy` or `yRx`) or they are the same element, `x = y`.
