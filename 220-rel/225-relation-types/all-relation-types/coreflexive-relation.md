# Coreflexive

> A relation ~ on a set X is called **coreflexive** if for all x and y in X it holds that if x ~ y then x = y

- An example of a coreflexive relation is the relation on integers in which each odd number is related to itself and there are no other relations.

- The equality relation is the only example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation, and any coreflexive relation is a subset of the identity relation.

- The union of a coreflexive relation and a transitive relation on the same set is always transitive.

- A relation R is coreflexive if, and only if, its symmetric closure is anti-symmetric.

* A reflexive relation on a nonempty set X can neither be irreflexive, nor asymmetric, nor antitransitive.

* The reflexive closure ≃ of a binary relation ~ on a set X is the smallest reflexive relation on X that is a superset of ~
* Equivalently, it is the union of ~ and the identity relation on X, formally: (≃) = (~) ∪ (=). For example, the reflexive closure of (<) is (≤).

* The reflexive reduction, or irreflexive kernel, of a binary relation ~ on a set X is the smallest relation ≆ such that ≆ shares the same reflexive closure as ~. It can be seen in a way as the opposite of the reflexive closure. It is equivalent to the complement of the identity relation on X with regard to ~, formally: (≆) = (~) \ (=). That is, it is equivalent to ~ except for where x~x is true. For example, the reflexive reduction of (≤) is (<).
