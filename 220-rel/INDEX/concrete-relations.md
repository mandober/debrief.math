* Operations can be presented as relations:
  - R = { (a, b)  | a = b - 1 }
  - a + b = c may be understood as the relation R(a,b,c)
    R = { (a,b,c) | a + b = c }
    R = { (a,b,c) | a + b <= c }
    R = { (a, b)  | (a = b ⋁ a = -b) ⋀ a + b < 5 }
    R = { (a, b)  | a = b + 2 ⋀ a + b < 10 }

- less then (LT), `<`
- not less then `≮`
- less then or equal to (LE), `≤`
- neither less-than nor equal to, `≰`
- LESS-THAN OVER EQUAL TO `≦`
- LESS-THAN BUT NOT EQUAL TO `≨`
- ⋜
- divides, `∣`
- does not divide, `∤`
- element of, `∈`
- not element of, `∉`
