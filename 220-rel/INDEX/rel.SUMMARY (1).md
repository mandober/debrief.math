# Relations ∷ SUMMARY by bullet point

- Relations are sets.
- Relations are sets which consist of ordered pairs.
- Ordered pairs model a relation (association) on sets.



A binary relation `R` on a set `A` is any subset of `A⨯A`:
- null relation `E` is just the empty set, E = ∅, since `∅ ⊆ A⨯A`
- universal relation `U` is the product set, U = A⨯A, since `U ⊆ A⨯A`



* A binary relation `R` between sets `A` and `B` (with variable `a` ranging over `A`, and variable `b` ranging over `B`) is any subset of the Carthesian product `A⨯B`, that is, `R` is a set consisting of the ordered pairs of the form `(a,b)`.



* A binary relation `R` on a set `A` (with variables `a` and `b` ranging over the elements of `A`) is any subset of the Carthesian product `A ⨯ A`, that is, `R` is a set consisting of the ordered pairs of the form `(a,b)`.



* A relation `R` on a set `A` is a subset of the product of `A` with itself.
* A relation `R` on a set `A` is a subset of `A` squared, `R ⊆ A⨯A`
* A relation `R` on a set `A` is an element of the set `𝓟(A⨯A)`
* A relation represents associations between sets


A relation
- A relation describes an association between sets
- Relations are directed associations between sets
- A relation is an "operation" involving one or more sets
- A relation itself is also a set (of tuples)
- A relation is a set of tuples
- A homogeneous rel involves one set ("a relation on a set")
- A hetergeneous involves two or more sets ("a relation between sets")

Binary relation
- a binary relation is the most common kind of relation
- a binary relation may be on 1 or 2 sets, i.e. the number of sets involved doesn't determine a relation's arity
- the number of operands (sets) in the operation of the Carthesian product does determine the arity of a relation.
- a binary relation is a set of ordered pairs (hence "binary")

Arity
- arity is one of the essential property of relations
- arity is specified by a natural number n >= 0
- arity is independent from the number of sets involved in a relation
- however, the number of sets involved often corresponds to arity

Distinct relations
- each distinct relation on sets A and B may be identified by a particular subset of their product, `R ⊆ A⨯B`
- thus, each distinct relation on sets A and B may be identified as a particular element in the powerset of their product, `R ∈ 𝓟(A⨯B)`
- Relations have direction: a relation `R ⊆ A⨯B` is not the same as `R ⊆ B⨯A`
- A relation may be described with an adjacency matrix, digraph
