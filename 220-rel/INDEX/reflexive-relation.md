# Reflexive relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation

A *homogeneous* *binary* relation `R` on a set `X` is reflexive if it relates every element of `X` to itself.

An example of a reflexive relation is the relation "is equal to" on the set of real numbers, since every real number is equal to itself.

A reflexive relation is said to have the *reflexive property* or is said to possess *reflexivity*.

Reflexivity, along with the properties of symmetry and transitivity defines *equivalence relation*.
