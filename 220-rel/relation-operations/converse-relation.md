# Converse relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_relation

The **transposition** of a binary relation `R` is the inverse relation `Rᵀ` that occurs when the order of the components in the set of ordered pairs that make the relation `R` is switched.

For example, the converse of the relation child-of is the relation parent-of.

Formally, if relation `R ⊆ A⨯B` is defined as `R = { (a,b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B }`, then the *converse relation* or *transpose* `Rᵀ ⊆ B⨯A` is defined so that `(b,a) ∈ Rᵀ <=> (a,b) ∈ R`.

In set-builder notation, `Rᵀ = { (y,x) ∈ Y⨯X | (x,y) ∈ R }`.

The notation is analogous with that for an inverse function. Although many functions do not have an inverse, every relation does have a unique converse.

The unary operation that maps a relation to the converse relation is an *involution*, so it induces the structure of a semigroup with involution on the binary relations on a set, or, more generally, induces a dagger category on the category of relations.

As a unary operation, taking the converse commutes with the order-related operations of the *calculus of relations*, that is it commutes with union, intersection, and complement.

The converse relation is also called the *transpose relation* - the latter in view of its similarity with the transpose of a matrix. It has also been called the *opposite* or *dual* of the original relation, or the *inverse* of the original relation, or the *reciprocal* `R°` of the relation `R`.

Besides `Rᵀ`, other notations include `R°`, `R⁻¹`, `Ř` (or `ʀ` and `ʁ`).
