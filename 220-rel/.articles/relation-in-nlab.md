## 1\. Idea

A *relation* is the extension of a *[predicate][26]*. That is, if you have a statement whose [truth value][27] may depend on some [variables][28], then you get a relation that consists of those instantiations of the variables that make the statement [true][29]. Equivalently, you can think of a relation as a [function][30] whose [target][31] is the set of truth values.

## 2\. Definitions

### General case

### Special cases

A __nullary relation__ is a relation on the empty family of sets. This is the same as a [truth value][32].

A __unary relation on AA__ is a relation on the singleton family (A)(A). This is the same as a [subset][33] of AA.

A __binary relation on AA and BB__ is a relation on the family (A,B)(A,B), that is a subset of A√óBA \\times B. This is also called a __relation from AA to BB__, especially in the context of the 22\-category [Rel][34] described below, or sometimes called a __heterogenous relation__.

A __binary relation on AA__ is a relation on (A,A)(A,A), that is a relation from AA to itself. This is sometimes called a __homogenous relation__ on AA, simply a __relation on AA__, or just an __endorelation__ with its set implicit as a property if not explicitly mentioned.

An __nn\-ary relation__ on AA is a relation on a family of nn copies of AA, that is a subset of A nA^n.

For a binary relation, one often uses a symbol such as ‚àº\\sim and writes a‚àºba \\sim b instead of (a,b)‚àà‚àº(a,b) \\in \\sim. Actually, even when a relation is given by a letter such as RR, one often sees aRba R b instead of (a,b)‚ààR(a,b) \\in R, although now that does not look so good.

## 3\. Morphisms

If AA and BB are each sets equipped with a relation, then what makes a [function][35] f:A‚ÜíBf: A \\to B a *morphism* of sets so equipped?

There are really two ways to do this, shown below. (We will write these as if each set is equipped with a binary relation ‚àº\\sim, but any fixed arity would work.)

-   ff __preserves__ the relation if x‚àºy‚áíf(x)‚àºf(y)x \\sim y \\;\\Rightarrow\\; f(x) \\sim f(y) always;
-   *f* __reflects__ the relation if x‚àºy‚áêf(x)‚àºf(y)x \\sim y \\;\\Leftarrow\\; f(x) \\sim f(y) always.

Now, if ff is a [bijection][36], then it preserves the relation if and only if its inverse reflects it, so clearly an [isomorphism][37] of relation-equipped sets should do both. What about a mere morphism?

In general, it's more natural to require only preservation; these are the morphisms you get if you consider a set with a relation as a models of a [finite-limit theory][38] or a simply [directed graph][39].

But in some contexts, particularly when dealing only with [irreflexive relation][40]s, we instead require (only) that a morphism reflect the relation. Sometimes an even stricter condition is imposed, as for [well-order][41]s. But even in these cases, the definition of isomorphism comes out the same.

## 4\. Binary relations

Binary relations are especially widely used.

### Kinds of binary relations

Special kinds of relations from AA to BB include:

-   [functional relations][42],
-   [entire relations][43],
-   one-to-one relation[?][44]s,
-   onto relation[?][45]s.

Combinations of the above properties of binary relations produce:

-   [functions][46],
-   [partial functions][47],
-   [injections][48],
-   [surjections][49],
-   [bijections][50].

Special kinds of binary relations on AA (so from AA to itself) additionally include:

-   [reflexive][51] and [irreflexive][52] relations;
-   [symmetric][53], [antisymmetric][54], and [asymmetric][55] relations;
-   [transitive relations][56] and comparisons[?][57];
-   left and right [euclidean relations][58];
-   [total][59] and [connected][60] relations;
-   [extensional][61] and [well-founded][62] relations.

Combinations of the above properties of binary relations produce:

-   [equivalence relations][63],
-   [partial equivalence relations][64],
-   [apartness relations][65],
-   the various kinds of [orders][66] (which see).

### Properties

Every binary endorelation RR has an [equivalence relation][67] ‚àº R\\sim\_R generated by RR.

### Binary relations as a coalgebra

By [currying][68] the binary relation R:ùí´(X√óX)‚âÖX√óX‚ÜíŒ©R: \\mathcal{P}(X \\times X) \\cong X \\times X \\rightarrow \\Omega, one gets a [coalgebra][69] Œ∏:X‚Üí(X‚ÜíŒ©)‚âÖX‚Üíùí´(X)\\theta: X \\rightarrow (X \\rightarrow \\Omega) \\cong X \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}(X) for the [powerset][70] [endofunctor][71] on [Set][72].

### The 22\-poset of binary relations

Binary relations form a 22\-[category][73] (in fact a 22\-[poset][74]) [Rel][75], which is the basic example of an [allegory][76].

The [objects][77] are [sets][78], the [morphisms][79] from AA to BB are the binary relations on AA and BB, and there is a [2-morphism][80] from RR to SS (both from AA to BB) if RR implies SS (that is, when (a,b)‚ààR(a,b) \\in R, then (a,b)‚ààS(a,b) \\in S).

The interesting definition is [composition][81]

Defintion 4.1. If RR is a relation from AA to BB and SS is a relation from BB to CC, then their *composite relation* - written S‚àòRS \\circ R or R;SR;S - from AA to CC is defined as follows:

(a,c)‚ààR;S‚áî‚àÉb:B,(a,b)‚ààR‚àß(b,c)‚ààS.(a,c) \\in R;S \\;\\Leftrightarrow\\; \\exists b: B,\\; (a,b) \\in R \\;\\wedge\\; (b,c) \\in S.

The identity morphism is given by [equality][82].

The special properties of the kinds of binary relations listed earlier can all be described in terms internal to [Rel][83]; most of them make sense in any [allegory][84]. Irreflexive and asymmetric relations are most useful if the allegory's [hom-poset][85]s have [bottom][86] elements, and linear relations require this. Comparisons require the hom-posets to have finite [unions][87], and well-founded relations require some sort of higher-order structure.

As a [function][88] may be seen as a functional, entire relation, so the category [Set][89] of sets and functions is a [subcategory][90] of [Rel][91] (in fact a [replete][92] and locally [full][93] sub-22\-category).

### The quasitopos of endorelations

Endorelations on sets are the objects of the [quasitopos][94] __EndoRelEndoRel__ or __BinBin__. It is a [reflective subcategory][95] of [Quiv][96] the [presheaf topos][97] of quivers and its morphisms are quiver morphisms. Endorelations are the [separated presheaves][98] for the [double negation topology][99] on QuivQuiv. "Separated" here translates to a quiver having at most one arc between pairs of verticies. The [reflector][100] Quiv‚ÜíEndoRelQuiv \\to EndoRel collapses parallel arcs together. Such quivers might also be called __singular__ or __simple__ though sometimes "simple" also means "no loops".

#### Relation closures as reflexive subcategories of EndoRelEndoRel

All of the sub-types of endorelations with positive conditions ([reflexive][101], [symmetric][102], [transitive][103], and left and right [euclidean][104]) and their combinations have an associated [closure][105] that can produce one from an arbitrary relation. Such a closure [completes][106] a relation by adding the least number of arcs such that the conditions are satisfied. Within EndoRelEndoRel these closures are reflectors that produce reflective subcategories. For example the __symmetric closure__ sym:EndoRel‚ÜíEndoSymsym: EndoRel \\to EndoSym will (possibly) enlarge a quiver that contains any arc v a‚Üív bv\_a \\to v\_b to one that also contains v b‚Üív av\_b \\to v\_a. The __transitive and reflexive closure__ transRef:EndoRel‚ÜíEndoTransReftransRef: EndoRel \\to EndoTransRef produces a category which is isomorphic to [PreOrd][107] though its objects are the underlying quivers of the preorders which are the objects of PreOrdPreOrd.

In addition to being reflective, the categories from the *symmetric*, *reflexive*, and *symmetric and reflexive* closures are also quasitoposes that can be [directly defined][108] through double negation separation. The *symmetric and reflexive* closure ([SimpGph][109]) is also a [Grothendieck quasitopos][110]. On the other hand PreOrdPreOrd is not a quasitopos because it is not a [regular category][111].

## 5\. Generalisation

Most of the preceding makes sense in any [category][112] with enough [products][113]; giving rise to [internal relations][114], for instance *[congruences][115]* in the case of internal equivalence relations.

Probably the trickiest bit is the definition of [composition][116] of binary relations, so not every category with [finite products][117] has an [allegory][118] of relations. In fact, in a certain precise sense, a category has an allegory of relations if and only if it is [regular][119]. It can then be recovered from this allegory by looking at the functional entire relations.
