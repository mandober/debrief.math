# Relations on sets

Factors involved:
* If `R` is on a set `A`, what happens if
  - A is the empty set, `A = ‚àÖ`
  - A is an nonempty set, `A ‚â† ‚àÖ`
  - A is a singleton set, `A = 1`
  - A is a pair set, `A = 2`, e.g. ùîπ
  - A is a finite set
  - A is an infinite set
* infinite relation set
  - finite relation, finitary relation
  - infinite relation, infinitary relation
  - null relation
  - universal relation
* Interaction of the sets above with:
  - null relation
  - universal relation
  - identity relation
* Closures
  - minimal closure to satisfy a given relation type
* Vacuously satisfied relations
  - is `R`
    - reflexive
    - symmetric
    - transitive
  - on `‚àÖ`?
  - on nonempty set `‚àÖ`?
  - interaction between ‚àÖ and null rel
