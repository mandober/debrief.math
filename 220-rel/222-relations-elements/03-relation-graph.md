# Relations :: Elements of relations :: Graph

Given a full definition of a relation `R` as the tuple `(A, G, B)`, the graph of the relation is `G` which is `G ⊆ A⨯B`.

The graph of the relation is the set of all ordered pairs `(a,b) ∈ G` where `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`.

`G = { (a,b) ∈ G | a ∈ A ⋀ b ∈ B }`
