# Membership relation

membership relations:
- set membership relation
  - urelement and set, u ∈ A
  - set and set, x ∈ y
- proper class membership relation
  - class contains sets
  - proper class contains y-objects
  - sets contain x-objects
  - objects: urelements, sets, proper sets, classes, proper classes
  - x-objects: urelements, sets
  - y-objects: sets, classes

*Set membership relation*, `∈`, is probably often considered as an examplary heterogenous relation since it is, by default, understood to relate an object `x` and a set `A`, as in `x ∈ A`. However, since sets are also objects, it is more appropriate to see it as a homogeneous relations instead.

*Proper-class membership relation*, also denoted by `∈`, is a proper heterogenous relation since it relates an object and a proper class - and proper class is always a container, never an element.
