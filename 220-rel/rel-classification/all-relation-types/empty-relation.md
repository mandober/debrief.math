# Empty relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_relation

Some particular homogeneous relations over a set `X` (with arbitrary elements `x` and `x′`) are:

Empty relation, `E = ∅`, that is, `xEx′` holds never.

Universal relation, `𝓤 = X × X`, that is, `x𝓤x′` holds always.

Identity relation, `I = {(x, x) | x ∈ X}`, that is, `xIx′` holds iff `x = x′`.
