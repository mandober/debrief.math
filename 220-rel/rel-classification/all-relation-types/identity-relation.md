# Identity relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_relation

Some particular homogeneous relations, `R ⊆ X×X`, over a set `X` (with arbitrary elements `x` and `x′`) are:

* Empty relation, `E = ∅`; that is, `xEx′` holds never.

* Universal relation, `U = X×X`; that is, `xUx′` holds always.

* Identity relation, `I = {(x, x) | x ∈ X}`; that is, `xIx′` holds iff `x = x′`.
