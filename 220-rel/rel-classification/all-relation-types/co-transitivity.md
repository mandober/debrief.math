# Co-transitivity

In constructive mathematics, an *apartness relation* is a constructive form of *inequality*, and is often taken to be more basic than equality. It is often written as `#` or `⧣` to distinguish it from the *negation of equality* (the denial inequality) `≠`, which is weaker. An apartness relation is a *symmetric irreflexive binary relation* with the additional condition that if two elements are apart, then any other element is apart from at least one of them (this last property is often called **co-transitivity** or *comparison*).
