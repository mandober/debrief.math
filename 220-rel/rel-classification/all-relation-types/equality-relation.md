# Equality relation

The equality relation is the only example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation, and any coreflexive relation is a subset of the identity relation.

The equality relation is also
- an equivalence relation (refl, sym, trans)
- a partial equivalence relation (sym, trans)
- a dependency relation
- a preorder

* Equality is both an equivalence relation and a partial order.
* Equality is the only relation on a set that is refl, sym and antisymmetric.

In algebraic expressions, equal variables may be substituted for one another, a facility that is not available for equivalence related variables. The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation can substitute for one another, but not individuals within a class.
