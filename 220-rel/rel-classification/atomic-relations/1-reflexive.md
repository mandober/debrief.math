# Reflexive relation

A relation `R` on a set `X` has the property of *reflexivity*, or is said to be *reflexive* if

`∀x ∈ X. xRx`

Note the universal quantifer!

A homogeneous binary relation `R = (A,G)`, where `A` is a nonempty domain (and codomain) set and `G` is the graph of a relation, is reflexive iff

`G reflexive` ⟺ `∀a(a ∈ A -> (a,a) ∈ G)`

A relation `R = (A, G)` is reflexive iff `∀a(a ∈ A -> (a,a) ∈ G)`.

The property of reflexivity is a property of reflexive relations.

To determine whether a relation is reflexive, the domain of a relation, `A`, must also be specified - specifying only the graph of a relation, `G`, is not enough to determine reflexivity.

To check whether a relation `R = (A, G)` is really reflexive the preimage of the relation (graph's preimage) must be equal to the domain, `Pre(G) = Dom(R)`.
