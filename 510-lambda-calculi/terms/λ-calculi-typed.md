## Typed lambda calculi

In this context, types are usually *objects of a syntactic nature* that are assigned to *lambda terms*; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered.

From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the *untyped lambda calculus*, but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory where the untyped lambda calculus is just a special case with a single (all-encompassing, universal) type.

*Typed lambda calculi* are foundational programming languages and are the base of typed *functional programming languages* such as ML and Haskell and, more indirectly, typed imperative programming languages.

Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of type systems for programming languages; here *typability* usually captures desirable properties of the program (e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation).

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to mathematical logic and proof theory via the **Curryâ€“Howard isomorphism** and they can be considered as the internal language of *classes of categories*, e.g. the simply typed lambda calculus is the language of *cartesian closed categories*.

> The simply typed lambda calculus is the language of Cartesian Closed Categories.
