## Class
In set theory and its applications throughout math, a **class** is a collection of sets (sometimes other mathematical objects are permitted) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share.

The precise definition depends on foundational context.

In Zermelo–Fraenkel Set Theory, the notion of class is informal.

In von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, the notion of class is axiomatized as a **proper class** - an entity that is not a member of another entity.

A class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo–Fraenkel) is called a **proper class**, and a class that is a set is sometimes called a **small class**.

For instance, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all sets, are proper classes in many formal systems.

In Quine's set-theoretical writing, the phrase "ultimate class" is often used instead of the phrase "proper class" em;
phasising that in the systems he considers, certain classes cannot be members, and are thus the final term in any membership chain to which they belong.

Outside set theory, the word "class" is sometimes used synonymously with "set". This usage dates from a historical period where classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of "classes" in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or perhaps rather take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets.


## Subclass
A **subclass** is a class contained in some other class in the same way that a subset is a set contained in some other set.

That is, given classes A and B, A is a subclass of B if and only if every member of A is also a member of B. If A and B are sets, then of course A is also a subset of B. In fact, when using a definition of classes that requires them to be first-order definable, it's enough that B be a set; the axiom of specification essentially says that A must then also be a set.

As with subsets, the empty set is a subclass of every class, and any class is a subclass of itself. But additionally, every class is a subclass of the class of all sets. Accordingly, the subclass relation makes the collection of all classes into a Boolean lattice, which the subset relation does not do for the collection of all sets. Instead, the collection of all sets is an ideal in the collection of all classes. (Of course, the collection of all classes is something larger than even a class!)
