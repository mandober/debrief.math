- *Axiom of choice*: The product of any set of non-empty sets is non-empty
- Axiom of countable choice: The product of a countable number of non-empty sets is non-empty
- Axiom of dependent choice: A weak form of *the axiom of choice*
- Axiom of finite choice: Any product of non-empty finite sets is non-empty
- Axiom of global choice: There is a global choice function

- Axiom of adjunction: Adjoining a set to another set produces a set
- Axiom of comprehension: The class of all sets with a given property is a set (usually contradictory)
- Axiom of constructibility: Any set is constructible, often abbreviated as V=L
- Axiom of countability: Every set is hereditarily countable
- Axiom of elementary sets: describes the sets with 0, 1, or 2 elements
- Axiom of extensionality (extent)
- Axiom of heredity: Any member of a set is a set (used in Ackermann's system)
- Axiom of limitation of size: A class is a set iff it has smaller cardinality than the class of all sets

- Axiom of empty set: The empty set exists
- Axiom of infinity: The infinite set exists
- Axiom of pairing: Unordered pairs of sets are sets
- Axiom of power set (subsets): The powerset of any set is a set
- Axiom of regularity (foundation): sets are well founded
- Axiom of union (amalgamation): The union of all elements of a set is a set

- Axiom of substitution (replacement): The image of a set under a function is a set
- Axiom schema of replacement: The image of a set under a function is a set
- Axiom schema of separation (specification): The elements of a set with some property form a set
- Axiom schema of predicative separation: *Axiom of separation* for formulas whose quantifiers are bounded
- Axiom of collection: means either *the axiom of replacement* or *the axiom of separation*


- Axiom of determinacy: Certain games are determined, in other words one player has a winning strategy
- Axiom of projective determinacy: Certain games given by projective set are determined, in other words one player has a winning strategy
- Axiom of real determinacy: Certain games are determined, in other words one player has a winning strategy

- Aczel's anti-foundation axiom: Every accessible pointed directed graph corresponds to a unique set
- AD+: An extension of *the axiom of determinacy*
- Axiom F: The class of all ordinals is Mahlo (Mahlo cardinals) 
- Freiling's axiom of symmetry: Equivalent to the negation of the *continuum hypothesis*
