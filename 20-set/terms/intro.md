# Set Fundamentals

Loosely, a set is a container and an object in its own right; it is a collection of discrete and finite objects; an object contained in a set is called a **set member** or a **set element**.

## Set is a primitive
Set is primitive mathematical notion - it is not defined in terms of any previously defined concepts. It escapes any attempt to formally define it, so it must be taken for granted, usually by appealing to one's intuition.

The *empty set* is also a primitive notion. To state that it exists would require an implicit axiom.

## Fundamental set properties
The most fundamental properties of a set are in terms of ordering and uniqueness: elements in a set are **unordered** (their order is immaterial), and the elements are **unique** (multiple instances of the same element are treated as a single object).

Sets can contain anything, but since we're concerned with math here, sets will contain well-defined mathematical objects. Being well-defined should enforce the requirement that only unambiguously defined candidates are to be accepted into a set.
