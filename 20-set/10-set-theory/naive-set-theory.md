# Naive Set Theory

Naïve (unformalized) set theory describes the sets informally. It assumes the existence of a universal set, despite the fact that such an assumption leads to paradoxes. Consistent systems of naïve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.

The first development of set theory was a naïve set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th century by Georg Cantor as part of his study of infinite sets and developed by Gottlob Frege in his `Begriffsschrift`.

The term "naïve set theory" may refer to several very distinct notions. In one sense, it may be an *informal presentation of an otherwise axiomatic set theory* (e.g. as in "Naïve Set Theory" by Paul Halmos). In another sense, it may refer to the early or later versions of Cantor's set theory or other informal systems. It may also refer to the *decidedly inconsistent theories*, axiomatic or not, such as Frege's set theory that yielded Russell's paradox, also to the theories of Peano and Dedekind.
