Mathematical subjects typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many researchers. However, set theory was founded by a single paper, published in 1874 by Georg Cantor: "On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers".


## Naive Set Theory

The term *"naïve set theory"* may refer to very different things:
1. It may be an informal presentation of an otherwise axiomatic set theory,   
  e.g. `"Naïve Set Theory"` by Paul Halmos
2. It may refer to the early or later versions of Cantor's set theory or other informal systems.
3. It may refer to the decidedly inconsistent theories (axiomatic or not) such as *Frege's set theory* (which yielded Russell's paradox), *Peano's set theory*, *Dedekind's set theory*, etc.


The sets were introduced by Georg Cantor at the end of the XIX century set, although Cantor was more into comparing infinities by measuring the cardinalities of sets, then developing a set theory.

A naive set theory is an informal approach to sets that was developed initially, in which the notion of a set is a primitive concept (so no proof required). 

A primitive concepts such as set, number, space, and such, are the starting point of developing a theory. Usually, a primitive notion is a theory's primary subject matter, whose properties are then described by the axioms; alternatively, a primitive notion may also be stated as one of the axioms.

Primitive notions and axioms require no proof because in order to start, a theory must stop the infinite regression by picking a term that is the central notion of the theory. Then, the term is introduced, without proof, just by appealing to human intuition. Otherwise, we'd be off chasing definitions of definition terms across the spacetime, with no money or hair, wearing nothing but a non-Euclidean smile.

A naive set theory treats sets as collections without restricting what can constitute a set. It assumes the existence of sets, particularly the universal set, despite the fact that such a broad assumption is ridden with paradoxes. However, it is still regarded as a useful introductory tool for the general notions about sets.


## Axiomatic Set Theory

Axiomatic set theory is a rigorous axiomatic theory developed in response to the discovery of the serious flaws such as Russell's paradox. The sets are the objects that satisfy the prescribed axioms. Numerous axiomatic set theories were proposed in the early XX century, approximately at the rate of one set theory per every 3 celebrity mathematicians quien tiene chicle en cerebro.

> Axiomatic set theory describes the aspects of sets using formal logic.

An axiomatic set theory is a formal system based on axioms. The notion of a set is either taken as a primitive or it is explicitly introduced by an axiom. The axioms state the rules for what constitutes a set, describing the acceptable behavior of sets and their legal properties. Other set-related notions (the existence of the empty set, the universal set, infinite sets, etc.) are also introduced with appropriate axioms.

# Axiomatic set theory

Axiomatic set theory is a system of set theory which differs from so-called naive set theory in that the sets which are allowed to be generated are strictly constrained by the axioms.

**Axiomatic set theory** is a system that constrains the sets, which are allowed to be generated, by axioms. The best known systems of axiomatic set theory are ZF, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and **ZFC**, which is ZF with the additional _Axiom of Choice_.



## Internal set theory

**Internal set theory** is an axiomatic extension of set theory that supports a logically consistent identification of unlimited (enormously large) and infinitesimal elements within the real numbers.

Various versions of logic have associated sorts of sets (such as fuzzy sets in fuzzy logic).

## Naïve set theory
Naïve set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics. Unlike __axiomatic set theories__, which are defined using formal logic, naïve set theory is defined informally, in natural language.

It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.

Sets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Naïve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments.


## Quine's New Foundations (NF)
Quine's system of axiomatic set theory, NF, takes its name from the title "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic", which was a 1937 article which introduced it. The axioms of NF are extensionality together with stratified comprehension.
