# Introduction to sets

Sets are ubiquitous in mathematics, they occur in many math branches and they are extensively used in logic and, by extension, in CS. In fact, sets are considered as the foundation of all mathematics. Concretely, *Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory* (ZF) is accepted by majority of mathematicians as the axiomatization system best fitted to serve as the foundation of mathematics. This means that the entirety of mathematics can be derived from ZF set theory.

Sets were introduced by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His work in 1874-1884 marks the origin of the set theory. Cantor introduced the concept of a set saying: *"A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite distinct objects of our perception or thought, called the elements of the set"*.
