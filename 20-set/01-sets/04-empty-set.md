## The empty set

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set

- *The* empty set is a set without elements, its cardinality is 0
- it is denoted by {} also âˆ… (latex: `\varnothing` $$\varnothing$$)
- it is a unique set (hence *the* empty set)
- many possible properties of sets are *vacuously true* for the empty set


The empty set contains no elements, nevertheless it is regarded as a mathematical object in its own right, once defined within a theory. It may be introduced as a mathematical primitive or its existence may be assured by an axiom, e.g. **the axiom of the empty set**. In other theories, the existence of the empty set may be derived from the axioms (since it's handy it's useful to derive it early and use it as a lemma thereafter).



## The empty set

* There is only one empty set (hence *the* empty set).
* The empty set is subset of every set
* The empty set is a member of a set's powerset.
* The empty set is not a member of a set's partition.


> The empty set is a subset of every set

$$
\varnothing \subseteq S           \\ 
\varnothing \subseteq \varnothing \\ 
\varnothing \subseteq \mathcal{U} \\
$$

existing object, usually denoted by $$\varnothing$$, so $$\{\}=\varnothing = \emptyset$$

The empty set is the only set whose cardinality is zero, $$|\varnothing|=0$$.

$$
\overline{A\cup B} \\
\varnothing = \{x:x\not\in X\}
$$

> The empty set is a subset of any set.

$$
\varnothing \subseteq X , \ \ \text{where X is any set}
$$

> The empty set is a proper subset of any non-empty set.

$$
\varnothing \subset X , \ \ \text{where X is a non-empty set}
$$

Note: $$\varnothing=\{\}$$, $$\{\varnothing\}=\{\{\}\}$$, so $$\varnothing\neq \{\varnothing\} $$.


The __empty set__ is the set that has no elements. It is denoted as $$\varnothing$$ and it represents $$\{\}$$. The empty set is the only set whose cardinality is zero.


- $$\varnothing=\{\}\neq\{\{\}\}=\{\varnothing\} $$
- the empty set is regarded as an existing object.
- empty set is a subset of any set
- empty set is a proper subset of any non-empty set
