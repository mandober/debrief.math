Some sets are associated with these, conventinally used, identifiers:
- a set (generic set) is usually denoted by a single letter, $$S$$
  - or, if several are considered at the same time, $$A, B, C, \dots$$
- The empty set, $$\{\}$$, has a special, unique symbol: $$\varnothing$$
  - there exists only one empty set.
- The universal set has its own letter, $$\mathcal{U}$$
  - it contains everything; there's only one universal set.
- The power set has its own letter, $$\mathcal{P}$$.
  - the power set of a set S is denoted by $$\mathcal{P}(S)$$.


The most fundamental number sets have their own unique identifier:
* ℕ, the set of the natural numbers, $$\mathbb{N}$$
* ℤ, the set of the integers, $$\mathbb{Z}$$ (from German *Zahl*)
* ℚ, the set of the rational numbers, $$\mathbb{Q}$$ (from *quotient*)
* ℝ, the set of the real numbers, $$\mathbb{R}$$
* ℂ, the set of the complex numbers, $$\mathbb{C}$$
* Their relation: $$\mathbb{N}\subset \mathbb{Z}\subset \mathbb{Q}\subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}$$
