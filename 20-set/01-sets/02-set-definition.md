# Set Definition

Initially, a naive (non-axiomatic) set theory was developed that treated sets as collections of any objects, posing no restriction as to what can constitute a set.

We also start here by taking the concept of a set for granted, as a *mathematical primitive*, allowing anything and everything to form a set and permitting any operation on sets. Later, we'll examine why this approach yields inconsistency. Set is usually introduced as a description similar to this one:

> A set $$S$$ is a collection of distinct objects, each of which is called an element (or member) of $$S$$.

**The axiom of comprehension** states that given any property, there is a set of all objects with that property. This axioms is what allows anything to constitute a set.

The axiom of comprehension may be curbed by introducing **the axiom of well-definedness** that states that a set is a *well-defined* collection of objects that share a common property. Being **well-defined** means that there is no ambiguity as to which elements belong to the set, however, this term alone cannot guarantee the consistency and clarity of what objects are exactly allowed to constitute a set.

Whether sets are considered in an axiomatic or naive system, they lack precise definition and must be introduced without a proof, either as a *mathematical primitive* or with an explicit *axiom*.

However, since sets are so ubiquitous and unavoidable, with many mathematical objects resembling a set of some kind, we must accept them based on intuition alone and take them for granted as a primitive object.

Once defined, a set is considered a mathematical object in its own right, different from any other object and distinct from any of its members. A set containing a single element is not the same as that element (even if that element is also a set): $$x\neq \{x\}$$

The elements of a set can be any objects, even other sets. There is no restriction on their size, and the order in which the elements are listed is inconsequential. Repetition of the same object as a set element is ignored - all elements are unique (diistinct).
