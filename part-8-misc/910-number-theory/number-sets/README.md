## Integers

Integer numbers include the natural numbers, zero and negative whole numbers. The reason for using ℤ to denote integers came from German word for whole number, viz. **Zahlen**.

Leopold Kronecker criticised Georg Cantor for his work on set theory with the quip: *"Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk"* ("God made the integers, and all the rest is man's work"), implying that the other numbers are artificial. However, Cantor's work on *transfinite numbers* proved to be far from artificial.

## Rational numbers

A number that equals the quotient of one integer divided by another (non-zero)
integer is a rational number.
