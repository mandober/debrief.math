# The whole numbers

Natural numbers and integers are both whole numbers.

The issue, and the reason to introduce the set of `whole numbers` is because the status of zero is still undecided with regards to its request for membership in the union of natural numbers, put forward by the association of mathematicians with computers (AoMwC), but actively ignored by the tradition- prone association of mathematicians without computers (AOMWC), for reasons having nothing to do with an age old dispute over the acronym of their respective organizations.

One view holds that the set of natural numbers includes the number zero. Alternative view insists on segregating the zero out from the naturals. Since there's no clear winner, there is a split brought about by this matter, meaning that you cannot assume anything even about such a fundamental thing like the $$\mathbb{N}$$. 

When encountering the bare-ass symbol, do not get rattled by the fact that the author hasn't made it explicit, somewhere in the same-chapter neighborhood, whether the symbol refers to the zero-free or the opposing camp. There's still hope, it's not game over. However, (cough, cough) in case the author has went to town decorating the symbol to remove even the slightest possibility of ambiguity - you're tapped. Abruptly quit. Right then and there.

Natural numbers are:
- Natural numbers are the proper subset of integers.
- the positive whole numbers
- the nonnegative whole numbers
