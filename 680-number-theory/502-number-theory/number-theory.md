# Number theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory

**Number theory** studies the integers and integer-valued functions, the properties of mathematical objects built from integers (e.g. â„š) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g. algebraic integers).

with the most focus on the prime numbers



The distribution of prime numbers is a central point of study in number theory.

German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) said, "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences-and number theory is the queen of mathematics."


Integers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of analytical objects (e.g. the Riemann zeta function) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion (analytic number theory). One may also study real numbers in relation to rational numbers, e.g. as approximated by the latter (Diophantine approximation).

The older term for number theory is arithmetic. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by "number theory".[note 2] (The word "arithmetic" is used by the general public to mean "elementary calculations"; it has also acquired other meanings in mathematical logic, as in Peano arithmetic, and computer science, as in floating-point arithmetic.) The use of the term arithmetic for number theory regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence.[note 3] In particular, arithmetical is commonly preferred as an adjective to number-theoretic.



**Number theory** is a branch of *pure mathematics* that primarily studies the properties of integers, especially prime numbers, and the properties of other number-theoretic objects made out of integers (rational numbers), or defined as generalizations of the integers (algebraic integers).

Integers can be considered per se, or as solutions to equations (Diophantine geometry).

Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of *analytical objects* (e.g. the Riemann zeta function) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion (*analytic number theory*).

Number theory is a branch of math concerned with the behavior of integers. It has important applications in cryptography and in the design of randomized algorithms.


Randomization is an important technique for creating fast algorithms for storing and retrieving objects (hash tables), testing whether two objects are the same (two files), and similar.

Much of the underlying theory depends on divisiblity and primality.
