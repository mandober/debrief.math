In cryptograhy we often multiply two numbers together, and the challenge is to determine the two values which caused the result. For example the factors of 77 and 7 and 11. Normally this is done with prime numbers, and where we have to determine the two prime numbers which makes a given value. Computers generally find this a difficult problem, but there are methods arround to factorise without using brute force. One example is the Elliptic Curve method. For example the factors of 361,187 are 953 and 379.
