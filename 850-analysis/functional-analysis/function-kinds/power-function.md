# Power functions

A **power function** is a function of the form, `f(x) = axᵖ`, where `a≠0` is a constant, aka coefficient, and `p ∈ ℝ`.

Examples
- 3x²
- x¹′² = √x
- -3√x
- 1/x = x⁻¹
- -5/x² = -5 x⁻²
- -7³√x² = -7 x²′³

*Root functions*, like `√x`, are a kind of power functions, as are *rational functions* or *reciprocal functions*, like `1/x = x⁻¹`.

Graphically, power functions can resemble *exponential* or *logarithmic* functions for some values of `x`. However, as `x` gets very large, power functions and exponential or logarithmic functions begin to diverge from each other.

A function that grows exponentially will overtake a power function for large values of `x`. On the other hand, growing power functions will overtake logarithmic functions for large values of `x`.
