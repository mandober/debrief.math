# Sequences and Series :: SUMMARY

- associativity and commutativity do not necessarily hold for infinite sums
- absolutely convergent series
- conditionally convergent series converges only within 
- Riemann Series Theorem: any conditionally convergent series can be permuted so it diverges or so its sum is a finite real number.
- rearranging an absolutely convergent series preserves its sum.
