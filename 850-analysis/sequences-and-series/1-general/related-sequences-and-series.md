# Related sequences and series

Any given sequence/series has numerous derived and related sequence/series.

If we call the given series "the original series", `Σaₙ`, a series immediately derivable from it is the absolute value series, `Σ|aₙ|` in which the terms are all positive. Another variant is a series that has the sign of each term flipped. Of course, nothing will change unless the original series is alternating or has at least some negative terms.

These manipulations are similar to replacing the minus signs that join terms with plus signs. A series does exactly that - it replaces the comma of the corresponding sequence with the plus sign, yielding a summation. Product, expressed using the pi notation, replaces the comma of a sequence with the multiplication sign.

We can also derive a series that skips every n-th term. We can focus on a finite initial segment of the original series, deriving new sequences from it, or we can focus on its tail.

We can also manipulate the formula that defines the series and obtain related series by removing all or some constant terms, then comparing the two series to infer their contribution.

Besides these families of the original sequence or series, most sequences/series have a *corresponding function* which is their defining formula expressed as a function. These underlying functions swap the descrete variable `n` of the sequence/series for a continuous variable `x`. Many properties of sequences and series can be discovered by manipulating the corresponding functions.

A declaration of a sequence or series by stating its defining formula on the right side, along with expanding a few terms on the left side, is also manipulated, either together or separately: only the left part, i.e. the formula, or only the right part which is a listing of terms, possibly ending with the general formula that defines how to construct any term, i.e. the *formula for n-th term*.

Sequences commonly have a corresponding series which puts the terms of the sequence in summation expression. Direct conversion of an infinite sequence yields an infinite series, whose sum may converge to a constant or diverge into infinity. Series are also taken a partial sum of. A partial sum of an infinite series is a sum of a finite number of terms, which may be expressed using the sigma notation and replacing ∞ by that nunmber (which is the index of the final included term/summand). A number of partial sums of an infinite series can be calculated and a sequence can serve as a container in which we place the results, e.g. {S₁, S₂, S₃, …}, where `Sₙ` means a partial sum up to the term with index `n`. By aggregating partial sum like this we can infer if they tend to some limit.

Sequences have the notion of limit, and do series which also have the notion of the infinite sum (sum of the entire infinite series), as well as the notion of partial sums.
