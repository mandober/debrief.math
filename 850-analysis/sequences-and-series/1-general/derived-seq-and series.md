# Derived sequences and series

A sequences is "older" then a series, so we consider a sequence `aₙ` and a series based on it, `Σaₙ`. An altenating series based on the sequence `aₙ` could also be easily obtained, `Σ (-1)ⁿ aₙ`. This makes more sense when `aₙ` is a positive sequence, or if we explicitly make it so by taking the absolute value, thereby obtaining a positive sequence `|aₙ|`. We can also take the absolute value of a series, obtaining a positive series, `Σ|aₙ|` or to ensure we are converting a positive series into an alternating series, `Σ(-1)ⁿ |aₙ|`.

On the other hand, if we have an alternating series, `Σbₙ`, we can easily get rid of the *sign control* expression by taking its absolute value, `Σ|bₙ|`.

A sequence is commonly used as the base for a series, and the sequence itself may be defined by a *closed formula* or extensionally, by listing its terms. A closed formula can be converted into a function which usually replaces the descrete variable `n ∈ ℕ` for a continuous variable `x ∈ ℝ`. Having such corresponding function allows to e.g. take its derivative or to integrate it in order to discover properties of the origianl sequence or from the sequence derived series.
