>Are there relationships expressed by an equation that do represent a function but which still cannot be represented by an algebraic formula?

Yes, this can happen. For example, given the equation `x = y + 2ʸ`, if we want to express `y` as a function of `x`, there is no simple algebraic formula involving only `x` that equals `y`. However, each `x` does determine a unique value for `y`, and there are mathematical procedures by which `y` can be found to any desired accuracy. In this case, we say that the equation gives an implicit (implied) rule for `y` as a function of `x`, even though the formula cannot be written explicitly. These are called **implicit functions**.

A **power function** is a function with a single term that is the product of a real number (a *coefficient* which is a constant), and a variable, typically `x` raised to a fixed real number. The function for the area of a circle with radius `r` is `A(r) = πr²`, and the function for the volume of a sphere with radius `r` is `V(r) = 4⁄3πr³`. Both of these functions are power functions because they consist of a coefficient, `π` or `4⁄3π`, multiplied by a variable `r` raised to a power. 

>A power function is one that can be represented in the form `f(x) = kxⁿ`, where `k` and `n` are real numbers, and `k` is a constant coefficient.

For example, `2ˣ` is an exponential function but not a power function. Since the exponent may be 1 or 0 or even a fraction, many functions are actually power functions (id, constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, reciprocal, square root, nth root, …).





## Absolute maximum
the greatest value of a function over an interval

## Absolute minimum
the lowest value of a function over an interval

## average rate of change
the difference in the output values of a function found for two values of the input divided by the difference between the inputs

## composite function
the new function formed by function composition, when the output of one function is used as the input of another

## decreasing function
a function is decreasing in some open interval if  f(b)<f(a)
  for any two input values  a
  and  b
  in the given interval where  b>a

## dependent variable
an output variable
domain
the set of all possible input values for a relation
even function
a function whose graph is unchanged by horizontal reflection,  f(x)=f(−x),
  and is symmetric about the  y-
  axis
function
a relation in which each input value yields a unique output value
horizontal compression
a transformation that compresses a function's graph horizontally, by multiplying the input by a constant  b>1
 
horizontal line test
a method of testing whether a function is one-to-one by determining whether any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once
horizontal reflection
a transformation that reflects a function's graph across the y-axis by multiplying the input by  −1
 
horizontal shift
a transformation that shifts a function's graph left or right by adding a positive or negative constant to the input
horizontal stretch
a transformation that stretches a function's graph horizontally by multiplying the input by a constant  0<b<1
 
increasing function
a function is increasing in some open interval if  f(b)>f(a)
  for any two input values  a
  and  b
  in the given interval where  b>a
 
independent variable
an input variable
input
each object or value in a domain that relates to another object or value by a relationship known as a function
interval notation
a method of describing a set that includes all numbers between a lower limit and an upper limit; the lower and upper values are listed between brackets or parentheses, a square bracket indicating inclusion in the set, and a parenthesis indicating exclusion
inverse function
for any one-to-one function  f(x),
  the inverse is a function  f−1(x)
  such that  f−1(f(x))=x
  for all  x
  in the domain of  f;
  this also implies that  f(f−1(x))=x
  for all  x
  in the domain of  f−1
 
local extrema
collectively, all of a function's local maxima and minima
local maximum
a value of the input where a function changes from increasing to decreasing as the input value increases.
local minimum
a value of the input where a function changes from decreasing to increasing as the input value increases.
odd function
a function whose graph is unchanged by combined horizontal and vertical reflection,  f(x)=−f(−x),
  and is symmetric about the origin
one-to-one function
a function for which each value of the output is associated with a unique input value
output
each object or value in the range that is produced when an input value is entered into a function
piecewise function
a function in which more than one formula is used to define the output
range
the set of output values that result from the input values in a relation
rate of change
the change of an output quantity relative to the change of the input quantity
relation
a set of ordered pairs
set-builder notation
a method of describing a set by a rule that all of its members obey; it takes the form  {x|statement about x}
 
vertical compression
a function transformation that compresses the function's graph vertically by multiplying the output by a constant  0<a<1
 
vertical line test
a method of testing whether a graph represents a function by determining whether a vertical line intersects the graph no more than once
vertical reflection
a transformation that reflects a function's graph across the x-axis by multiplying the output by  −1
 
vertical shift
a transformation that shifts a function's graph up or down by adding a positive or negative constant to the output
vertical stretch
a transformation that stretches a function's graph vertically by multiplying the output by a constant  a>1
