# Indexing


If a series `Σaₙ` is defined by the closed formula `2ⁿ/n!`, then the expression `a₀` represents the value of its initial term, so it should evaluate to 1 (since 2⁰/0! = 1/1 = 1). The expression `a₁` should evalaute to 2 (since 2¹/1! = 2/1 = 2). We can also interpret these expressions as indexing the series, so `a₁` means retrieveing the term with index 1 from the series, which amounts to the same as evaluating it by plugging `n=1` into the formula.
