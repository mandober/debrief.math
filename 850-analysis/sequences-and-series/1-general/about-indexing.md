# About indexing

One difference between sequences and series is in the delimiter used to separate the terms: sequences use the comma, series use the plus sign. On the other hand, a thing that makes them similar is the use of indexing: each term is associated with a specific index, meaning it has a fixed position, which imposes an ordering of elements to a sequence and series.


When 1 is used as a lower bound, we call it *1-based indexing*, and when 0 is used it is *0-based indexing*. Normally, 1 and 0 are the two numbers commonly used to initialize the lower bound with (i.e. to start counting form), but there is no restriction on this, and any other positive integer may be used as well.
