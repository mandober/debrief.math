# Relation between sequences and series

A sequence may be completely arbitrary or logical (in accordance with a formula that shows how to calculate the next term), but even in the former case a sequence is considered a function from natural numbers to the values of the sequence (which are typically real numbers), `ℕ → ℝ`.

For an arbitrary sequence, this function is an *enumeration*, using the set ℕ merely to pull indexes to enumerate (index) each (arbitrary) term, but there is no connection between such function and the sequence. Normally, for the sequences we deal with, there is a connection between the function and the sequence. In fact, the function takes an independent variable, usually `x`, which is also used as the index, and transforms it into a term of the sequence.

By the way, *can a sequence truly be random* such that there's no relation whatsoever between its terms? Such that no formula exists to describe it? Intuitively, it seems extremely likely that this is the case as we can come up with some really crazy sequences. But then again, there are some really crazy formulas - maybe it's possible that one just might describe that sequence perfectly. After all, there is an unwieldy formula for the sequence of primes - and primes are pretty random - so there could be a formula for any sequence.

A series is usually "backed up" by a sequence, such that the series is obtained by replacing the commas in the sequence with pluses. If that sequence is describable by a function, then that function also has a connection with the derived series. There is usually some relation between at least some of these entities (in terms of the focused entity, which is here a sequence)
