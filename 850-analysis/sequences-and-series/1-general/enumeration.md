# Enumeration

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration

An **enumeration** is a complete, ordered listing of all the items in a collection.

The term is commonly used in mathematics and computer science to refer to a listing of all of the elements of a set.

The precise requirements for an enumeration (e.g. whether the set must be finite) depend on the discipline of study and the context of a given problem.

Some sets can be enumerated by means of a natural ordering (`1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦` for a set of positive integers), but in other cases it may be necessary to impose a (perhaps arbitrary) ordering.

In some contexts, such as *enumerative combinatorics*, the term enumeration is used more in the sense of counting - with emphasis on determination of the number of elements that a set contains, rather than the production of an explicit listing of those elements.

The last paragraphs highlights the two main uses of the term enumeration:
- counting sense, determination of the number of elements in a collection
- producing an explicit listing of elements of a collection

Most importantly, an enumeration is not a best-effort but exhaustive listing of the elements of a collection.
