# Relation between sequences and series

Note: in the following, most things apply to both sequence and series even if only one is mentioned. Usually, whenever the term "sequence" or "series" occurs alone, it may be replaced by "sequence/series", unless the notion is inapplicable.

What is said about sequences is especially relevant to series as well since any sequence gives rise to a corresponding series, formed by replacing the commas with the plus signs.

A sequence may be understood as an *unopinionated container* in that it doesn't suggest which operations should be applied to the contained terms - it just stores the terms. The corresponding series can be thought of as applying the addition operation on the sequence but stopping short before evaluating the summation, preferring to leave the overall sumamtion as a long expression consisting of the summands. An initial segment of its terms looks virtually the same as an initial segment of the corresponding sequence, save for the different delimiter between the terms (plus rather then comma).
