# Application of sequences and series

One important application of infinite sequences and series is using them to represent a differentiable function as an infinite sum of powers of the independent variable.

This allows us to extend differentiation and integration to a more general class of functions that cannot necessarily be represented in terms of elementary functions (power, trigonomentric, exponential, logarithmic).
