## Definition of a sequence

Almost all interesting sequences can be described by a *generating formula* (generating function) that shows how to construct any term of the sequence from an index.

In this way, a *sequence is a function* that enumerates the items. It maps natural numbers (used as indices) to terms; it is a map from non-negative integeres to terms.

Typically, the terms are real numbers, so the general type of "sequence as a function" is `ℕ → ℝ`.

These terms are seldom constant (numbers); more often then not, they are expressions (which, when evaluated, would end up as real numbers. However, their evaluation is not the main interest here).

With this in mind, a sequence may be given as that generating formula, e.g. `{n²}`, which makes it clear how to construct the sequenc, except it is not entirely clear at which index it starts.

There is no general consesus at which index should a sequence start.
