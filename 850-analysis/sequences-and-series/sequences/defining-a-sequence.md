# Defining sequences and series

- roster notation
  - stating an initial segment, ending in ellipsis
    - 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, …
  - stating an initial segment, ellipses, general term, ellipsis
    - 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, …, 1/2ᵏ, …
- using sigma notation
  - starting from 0: Σ{k=0..∞} 1/2ᵏᐩ¹  = 1/2 + 1/2² + 1/2³ + …
  - starting from 1: Σ{k=0..∞} 1/2ᵏ    = 1/2 + 1/2² + 1/2³ + …
- as a formula, {aₙ}ₖ₌₁ = 1/2ᵏ
- as a function, f(x) = (1/2)ˣ corresponds to {aₙ}ₖ₌₁ = 1/2ᵏ
- as a polynomial (function), f(x) = a + bx + cx²
- a sequence can be converted to a series (replace commas with pluses)
- partial sum can be taken from a series; sum up to the n-th term
