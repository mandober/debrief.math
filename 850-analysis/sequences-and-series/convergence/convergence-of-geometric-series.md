# Convergence of geometric series

```js
// geometric series that starts from 1
⎲∞
⎳ₙ₌₁ arⁿ⁻¹

// geometric series that starts from 0
⎲∞
⎳ₙ₌₀ arⁿ
```

However, whether a geometric series starts from 0 or 1 has no bearing on the common ratio, `r`, which is checked to determine the convergence of the series:
- `|r| < 1` ⇒ converges
- `|r| ≥ 1` ⇒ diverges
