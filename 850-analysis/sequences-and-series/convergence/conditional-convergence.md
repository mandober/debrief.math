# Conditional convergence

An infinite series is *absolutely convergent* if the sum of the absolute values of its terms is a constant. More precisely, a series, `∑ aₙ`, is absolutely convergent if `∑ |aₙ| = L`, (where `L ∈ ℝ`); that is, if the absolute value of the series converges to a constant. A convergent series that is not absolutely convergent is called conditionally convergent.

In other words, a convergent series is absolutely convergent if its absolute value (series) is convergent as well (the series converges as does its absolute value). Otherwise, if its absolute value is divergent, the series is called conditionally convergent (the series converges but not its absolute value).

While the possibility of divergence remains singular, these new notions split convergence in two, as a series can now be convergent in two different ways:
- absolutely convergent series
- conditionally convergent series

Convergence
- if `∑aₙ` and `∑|aₙ|` converge, then `∑aₙ` absolutely convergent
- if `∑aₙ` convergent but `∑|aₙ|` divergent, then `∑aₙ` conditionally convergent

>What is the relation of divergence of a series and its absolute value?
- Can a series be convergent while its absolute value is divergent (and vv)?
- Does divergence of a series implies divergence of its absolute value?
- Does divergence of its absolute value implies divergence of the series?
- Is there a connection between the two at all, in face of divergence?
