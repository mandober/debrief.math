# Convergence of sequences and series

Note: in the following, most things apply to both sequence and series even if only one is mentioned. Usually, whenever the term "sequence" or "series" occurs alone, it may be replaced by "sequence/series", unless the notion is inapplicable.





The terms of a sequence must eventually start to approach zero for the sequence to be convergent. This is usually because the denominator (e.g. in `{1/n}` where `n→∞`) keeps growing larger, overwhelming the nominator that remains constant, meaning the terms start to take on the form `1/∞`, which is 0.

The graph of a convergent series is usually characterized by a *horizontal asymptote* that intersects the y-axis at some value that represents the constant the series approaches but never reaches. If the horizontal asymptote coincides with the x-axis, it means the limit of the sequence is zero.

In testing for convergence, other properties of a series are often consulted
- whether it has a limit
- whether it the limit diverges or not
- whether it the integral of the corresponding function diverges or not
- whether its sum diverges or not
- whether its partial sum diverges or not
- whether the sequence is bounded
- whether the series is monotonic, either decreasing or increasing
- whether it is a positive (terms are positive) or negative, which, in turn, is determined by finding the 1st derivative of the corresponding function
- whether it passes another test
- whether it can be squeezed between two other series
- whether it can be compared to a larger/smaller series
- if it's alternating series


Properties of sequences/series
- bounded
- monotone
  - increasing
  - decreasing
- alternating

Kinds of sequences/series
- arithmetic
- geometric
- harmonic
- power series

Some results
- bounded and monotone ⇒ convergent
- convergent ⇒ bounded
- alternating + decreasing + inconclusive divergence test ⇒ convergent

Convergence tests
- Divergence test
- Direct limit comparison test
- p-series test
- ratio test
- root test
- Cauchy condensation test
