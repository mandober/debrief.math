# Divergence test

Divergence test:
- if `lim{n→∞} aₙ ≠ 0`, then the series diverges
- if `lim{n→∞} aₙ = 0`, the the test is inconclusive

The Divergence Test only guarantees that a series definitely diverges if its limit is not zero. If the limit is zero, the test is inconclusive - the series may or may not diverge, so additional tests are needed to tell.

Can we say that a series whose limit is zero is *non-divergent*, knowing that another test may actually prove the sequence divergent? Possibly the only sure take away from this test is that a sequence is divergent (saying that it is an inconclusive sequence doesn't sound as much of an attribute; we can't even call it non-divergent - although people often do - because another test may prove us wrong).

The Divergence Test only shows divergence when the limit os the sequence is non-zero. Now, a series whose limit is 0 is typically convergent, but it seems that is not always the case.

In the context of testing convergence of a sequence, we say that the Divergence Test passes when it is actually inconclusive. That is, the inconclusiveness of the test is treated as something desirable ("there's still hope it conveges").
