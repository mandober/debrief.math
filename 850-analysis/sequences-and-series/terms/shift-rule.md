# Shift rule

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_rule

The shift rule is a rule regarding sequences and series.

Here, `n,N ∈ ℕ`

* For sequences, the rule states that if `(aₙ)` is a sequence, then it converges iff `(aₙ﹢ɴ)` also converges, and in this case both sequences always converge to the same number. (n,N ∈ ℕ)

>sequence `{aₙ}` converges ⇔ `{aₙ﹢ɴ}` converges (to the same limit)

* For series, the shift rule states that the series `Σ{n=0..∞} aₙ` converges to a number iff `Σ{n=0..∞} aₙ﹢ɴ` converges. (n,N ∈ ℕ)

>series `aₙ` converges ⇔ series `aₙ﹢ɴ` converges
