# Unconditionally convergent

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconditional_convergence

In functional analysis, a series is **unconditionally convergent** if all reorderings of the series converge to the same value.

In contrast, a series is conditionally convergent if it converges but different orderings do not all converge to that same value. 

Unconditional convergence is equivalent to absolute convergence in finite-dimensional vector spaces, but is a weaker property in infinite dimensions.
