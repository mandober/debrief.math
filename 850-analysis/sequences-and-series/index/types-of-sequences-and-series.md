# Sequences and Series :: Types

Sequences and series are closely related and one can be implicitly treated as the other, so most of these types are common to both.

Types according to general properties
- infinite
  - finite
- bounded
  - bounded from below
  - bounded from above
  - unbounded
- monotonic
  - increasing
  - decreasing

Derived types
- alternating
- positive
- negative
- absolute value

General types
- arithmetic, AP
- geometric, GP
- arithmetico-geometric
- harmonic, HP
- p-series
- telescoping
- Cauchy sequence

Special types of series
- power series
- Taylor series
- Maclaurin series

According to convergence
- convergent
  - absolutely convergent
  - conditionally convergent
  - unconditionally convergent
- divergent

According to the limit
- limit is a constant (converges)
- limit is infinity (diverges)
- limit DNE (diverges)
