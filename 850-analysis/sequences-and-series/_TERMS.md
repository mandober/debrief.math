Terminology
- sequence: ordered collection with allowed repetition of terms
- sequence length
- sequence notation
- indexing
  - subscript
  - one-based indexing
  - zero-based indexing

Definition of sequence
- discrete definition
- explicit definition
- sequence as n-tuple
  - empty sequence, `()`
- sequence as function
  - discrete function
  - recursive function
- sequence as map
  - domain must be a countable set
  - thus range is also a countable set
- subsequence

  - geometric sequence
  - harmonic sequence
- numerical sequence
  - integer sequence
  - real sequence
  - complex sequence
  - polynomial sequence
- increasing sequence
  - decreasing sequence
  - non-increasing sequence
  - non-decreasing sequence
  - neither increasing nor decreasing
- monotonic sequence
  - monotonically increasing sequence
  - monotonically decreasing sequence
  - monotonic strictly increasing sequence
  - monotonic strictly decreasing sequence
- bounded sequence
  - unbounded sequence
  - bounded monotonic sequence
- convergent sequence
  - divergent sequence
  - non-convergent
  - non-divergent
- Cauchy sequence, fundamental sequence


Properties of sequences
- finiteness
- type of terms (integer sequence, polynomial seq, …)
- length of sequence: (empty), finite vs infinite
- increasing vs decreasing
- monotonicity: monotonic vs non-monotonic
- boundedness: bounded vs unbounded
- convergence vs divergence: convergent vs divergent
- limit of sequence
- Cauchy property

Monotonicity
- monotonic sequence, monotone sequence
- non-monotonic sequence (both increases and decreases)
  - non-increasing sequence
  - non-decreasing sequence
- monotonically increasing sequence
  - strictly increasing monotonic sequence
- monotonically decreasing sequence
  - strictly decreasing monotonic sequence

Boundedness
- bounded sequence
- unbounded sequence
- bounded monotonic sequence

Limit of sequence
- convergence
- divergence
- neighbourhood of ε
- ε region

Series
- definition of series

divergence test
ratio test
limit comparison test
direct comparison test
integral test
convergence
absolute and conditional convergence
series and calculus
Taylor series
power series
Leibniz π formula
