# Sequences

A sequence is a map from ℕ to ℝ, `a : ℕ → ℝ`, (aₙ) = (a₀, a₁, a₂, …, aₙ).

A sequence is convergent to `a ∈ ℝ` if its members eventually get arbitrarily close to `a`.

Given a very small but positive real number `ε`, the range from `a-ε` to `a+ε` is called the *neighbourhood of ε*, and, eventually, all sequence members need to lie in that region for `a` to be the *limit of the sequence*; only finitely many members may lie outside of it.

After an index `N`, identifying the sequence member `aɴ`, all the subsequent members of the sequence must lie within the *ε region*, `(aɴ﹢₁, aɴ﹢₂, …)`.

A sequence is *convergent* to `a ∈ ℝ` if `∃ε > 0`, `∃N.∀n ≥ N`. `|aₙ-a| < ε`.

This must work for any `ε`. Choosing a smaller `ε`
