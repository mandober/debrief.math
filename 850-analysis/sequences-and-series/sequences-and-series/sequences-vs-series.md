# Sequences vs series

## Similarities between sequences and series

A sequence and a series can both be viewed as orderings of terms which are connected with comma vs plus.

Given this unidentified ordering

    a₀ ∙ a₁ ∙ a₂ ∙ a₃

it can become a sequence if (∙) ⟼ (,)

    a₀, a₁, a₂, a₃

it can become a series if (∙) ⟼ (+)

    a₀ + a₁ + a₂ + a₃

A sequence is a compound mathematical object, an ordered collection of objects (called terms) and that is its value; it cannot be reduced further because it is a collection. The *value of a sequence* is the sequence itself.

The *value of a series*, on the other hand, is a single number. The value of a real number series is a real number. Series are often obtained from sequences by replacing the comma with the plus sign. If sequence is a nonreactive container, à la list, for keeping an ordered collection of objects, then a series represents one way of how the sequence (its content) gets used - by joining the elements with the plus operator, expressed in the sigma notation as summation. Another way to employ a sequence is to join its elements with the multiplication operator, expressed in the pi notation as a product. For some reason, that is all - there is no possibility to use other operators. Technically, neither are these 2 operators used directly on a sequence, although logically it may be viewed that way.

Summation of terms seems to be more interesting compared to multiplication of terms since there is no name corresponding to the term "series" with regards to multiplication. There is only the pi notation that help us express a product in a succinct way. It would be far more flexible if the iterating part of both sigma and pi notation was sepoarated from the operation - why use two big-ass symbols when one would suffice; and it would open the possibility to use another operator as a connector of terms.
