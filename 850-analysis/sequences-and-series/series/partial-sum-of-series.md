# Partial sum of series

An infinite series may be denoted by `aₙ`, although it is usually prefixed by the sigma symbol that makes it easier to discern that it is a series, `Σaₙ`.



A partial sum of an infinite series is the summation of an initial segment of the series up to the term with the specified index. Since we cannot always find out the infinite sum of an infinite series, we can at least figure out the sum of the terms of an initial segment, which gives the finite sum of the series, aka a partial sum ("partial" because it is not the true sum obtained by summing up the entire series). The "true" infinite sum of the entire infinite series is denoted by `S` or `S∞`, where `∞` should be written as a subscript to imitate the form of partial sums, `Sₙ` (where `n` is the index of the final term). In fact, `Sₙ` is a general form - an example of a concrete partial sum is `S₉` which sums up the initial 9 terms, as denoted by `S₉ = Σ{n=1..9} aₙ`, where `aₙ` is the (original underlying) infinite series.
