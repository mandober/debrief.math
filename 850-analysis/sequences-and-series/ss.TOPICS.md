## Sequences and Series

- Types of Sequences and Series
  - arithmetic
  - geometeric
  - harmonic
    - alternating harmonic series
  - powers of two
    - reciprocal powers of two
    - ratios of powers of two
  - alternating sequence
  - Fibonacci sequence



## Sequences
- Sequences
  - Sequence as a function
    - as a mapping
    - as an enumeration
    - as a transformation
    - from domain set ℕ to codomain set ℝ, `f : ℕ → ℝ`
    - it is a functional as it accepts a funarg to apply to each `i`
    - lower and upper bounds are additional arguments
    - although they may have defaults, e.g. lb=0 and ub=∞
    - iterator variable name `i` gets initialized as `let i = lb..ub`
    - which suggests the usefulness of partial application or currying
    - or the use of default arguments when implemented in a PL
  - Terminology And Anatomy Of Sequences
    - sequence name
    - sequence definition
    - sequence bounds
      - iterator variable name (typically `i`)
      - sequence lower bound (`i=0`)
      - sequence upper bound (`∞`)
      - iterator `i` then iterates through `i=0..∞`
  - Sequence indexing
    - sequence index
    - 0-based indexing
    - 1-based indexing
- Convergence And Divergence
  - theorems about convergence
  - tests for convergence
- Types Of Sequences
  - subsequence
  - arithmetic
    - difference between 2 consequtive terms
  - geometric
    - ratio between 2 consequtive terms
  - Fibonacci sequence
  - alternating sequence
  - harmonic sequence

  - bounds

## Series
  - partial sum
  - power series

harmonic series
  alternating harmonic series
  divergent harmonic series
- infinite series of real numbers
- convergent series
  - conditionally convergent series
  - unconditionally convergent series
  - absolutely convergent series

- arranging terms of a series in permutation
- series that converges to an arbitrary real number
- series that can be rearranged such that it diverges
- series of reals is absolutely convergent iff it's unconditionally convergent

## Theorems
- Riemann series theorem (Riemann rearrangement theorem)
