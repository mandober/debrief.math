# Sequences and series

```js
// series that starts counting from 1
⎲∞    1
⎳ₙ₌₁ ---- = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ⋯
       n

// equivalent series that starts counting from 0
⎲∞      1
⎳ₙ₌₀ ------- = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ⋯
       n + 1
```

If the lower bound has a wrong value, it can yield a sequence that skips a term or has an extra term.

```js
// sigma notation that starts from 1
⎲∞    1
⎳ₙ₌₁ ---- = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ⋯
       2ⁿ

// sigma notation that starts from 0
⎲∞     1
⎳ₙ₌₀ ----- = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ⋯
        2ⁿ
```
