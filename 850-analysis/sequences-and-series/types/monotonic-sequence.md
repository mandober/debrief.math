# Monotonic sequence

- monotonically increasing sequence, `aₙ₋₁ ≤ aₙ`
- monotonically decreasing sequence, `aₙ₋₁ ≥ aₙ`
- "strictly" uses `<` or `>`
- non-monotonic

>Bounded and monotonic sequence converges, `∀s(Ms ∧ Bs ⇒ Cs)`

If the first derivative of the function f(x) is negative then the function (and a sequence defined by it) is decreasing; if positive, it is increasing.
- `f′(x) < 0` ⇒ decreasing
- `f′(x) > 0` ⇒ increasing
