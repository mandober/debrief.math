# Alternating harmonic series

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_harmonic_series

When adding a finite number of terms, addition is both associative and commutative, meaning that grouping and rearrangment do not alter the final sum.
>However, associativity and commutativity of addition do not necessarily hold for infinite sums.

One example is the Alternating Harmonic Series (AHS):

```js
// alternating harmonic series is conditionally convergent
⎲∞          1
⎳ₙ₌₀ (-1)ⁿ ---- = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - 1/6 + ⋯ = ln(2)
             n
```

The AHS series converges. The individual terms of the AHS approach 0. The AHS converges to `ln(2)`.

The fact that a series converges implies that individual terms approach 0 (they tend to the limit 0), but the reverse is not necessarily true, i.e. if the terms tend to 0, does not necessarily mean the series converges. A prime example of this is the harmonic series that diverges despite having the terms that (eventually start to) approach 0.
