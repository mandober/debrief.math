# Mathematical analysis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis

*Analysis* is the branch of mathematics dealing with
- continuous functions
- limits
- differentiation
- integration
- measure
- sequences
- series
- analytic functions

These theories are usually studied in the context of
- real numbers and functions as Real Analysis
- complex numbers and functions as Complex Analysis

Analysis evolved from Calculus, which is about the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis of mathematical objects, primarily numbers and functions.

Analysis is distinguished from Geometry, however, it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of *nearness* (it has the notion of a *topological space*) or specific *distance* between objects (it has the notion of a *metric space*).

### 1.3.1 Foundations

The modern foundations of mathematical analysis were established in 17th century Europe.

This began when Fermat and Descartes developed *analytic geometry*, which is the precursor to modern calculus. Fermat's method of *adequality* allowed him to determine the maxima and minima of functions and the tangents of curves.

Descartes's publication of "La Géométrie" in 1637, which introduced the *Cartesian coordinate system*, is considered to be the establishment of mathematical analysis.

It would be a few decades later that Newton and Leibniz independently developed infinitesimal calculus, which grew, with the stimulus of applied work that continued through the 18th century, into analysis topics such as
- calculus of variations
- ordinary differential equations (ODE)
- partial differential equations (PDE)
- Fourier analysis
- generating functions

During this period, calculus techniques were applied to approximate discrete problems by continuous ones.

### 1.3.2 Modernization

>In the 18th century, Euler introduced the notion of a mathematical function.

Real analysis began to emerge as an independent subject when Bernard Bolzano introduced the modern definition of *continuity* in 1816, but Bolzano's work did not become widely known until the 1870s. 

In 1821, Cauchy began to put calculus on a firm logical foundation by rejecting the principle of the generality of algebra widely used in earlier work, particularly by Euler. Instead, Cauchy formulated calculus in terms of geometric ideas and infinitesimals. Thus, his definition of continuity required an infinitesimal change in `x` to correspond to an infinitesimal change in `y`. He also introduced the concept of the *Cauchy sequence*, and started the formal theory of *complex analysis*.

Poisson, Liouville, Fourier and others studied PDE and harmonic analysis. The contributions of these mathematicians and others, such as Weierstrass, developed the *(ε, δ)-definition of limit*, thus founding the modern field of mathematical analysis.

Around the same time, *Riemann integration* theory was introduced, with Riemann making significant advances in complex analysis.

Towards the end of the 19th century, mathematicians started worrying that they were assuming the existence of a continuum of real numbers without proof.

Dedekind responded by introducing the construction of the real numbers via *Dedekind cuts*, in which irrational numbers are formally defined, serving to fill the "gaps" between rational numbers. Thereby, a complete set was created - the continuum of real numbers, already undegoing developement by Simon Stevin in terms of *decimal expansions*.

Around that time, the attempts to refine the theorems of Riemann integration led to the study of the measure and "size" of the set of discontinuities of real functions.

Various pathological objects (such as nowhere continuous functions, continuous but nowhere differentiable functions, as well as space-filling functions and their curves), affectionately called "monsters", began to be investigated.

In this context, Jordan developed his *measure theory*, Cantor developed what is now called *naive set theory*, and Baire proved the *Baire category theorem*.

In the early 20th century, calculus was formalized using an axiomatic set theory. Lebesgue greatly improved measure theory, and introduced his own theory of integration, now known as Lebesgue integration, which proved to be a big improvement over Riemann's. Hilbert introduced Hilbert spaces to solve integral equations. The idea of normed vector space was in the air, and in the 1920s Banach created functional analysis.
