# Inverse element

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_element

The concept of an inverse element generalises the concepts of *opposite* (`−x`) and *reciprocal* (`1/x`) of numbers.

Inverse elements are always in relation to a particular binary operation. usually, each element of a set has its own inverse element. Inverse elements are defined in terms of the identity element, which is the same for a given binop - it is unique across the set; that is, all elements have the same identity element, which means that combining any element `x` with the identity element `ε` does not affect the element x: `ε • x = x = x • ε = x` (this is actually two-sided identity).

An inverse is usually different for each element `x` of a set. Each element `x` has its own inverse element such that: `x • x' = ε = x' • x` (where the tick denotes the inverse).

- if `x • x' = e` then `x'` is a right inverse of `x`
- if `x' • x = e` then `x'` is a left inverse of `x`


When the binop is associative, if an element `x` has both a left and right inverse, then these two inverses are equal and unique; then, they are called the *inverse element* or simply *the inverse*.

Often an adjective is attached to specify the operation in question, e.g. additive inverse, multiplicative inverse, or functional inverse.

An *invertible element* is an element that has an inverse.

In a ring, an invertible element, also called a *unit*, is an element that is invertible under multiplication (this is not ambiguous, as every element is invertible under addition).

Inverses are commonly used in groups (where every element is invertible), and rings (where invertible elements are also called units).

Inverses are also commonly used for operations that are not defined for all possible operands, such as inverse matrices and inverse functions.

This has been generalized to category theory, where, by definition, an *isomorphism* is an invertible morphism.

The word 'inverse' is derived from Latin: inversus that means 'turned upside down', 'overturned'. This may take its origin from the case of fractions, where the (multiplicative) inverse is obtained by exchanging the numerator and the denominator (the inverse of x/y is y/x).
