# Abstract algebra :: GLOSSARY

## Free object
A free object - in particular, a free algebra - is an algebraic structure that upholds only the defining axioms of that algebra and nothing else. For example, a monoid that upholds the 3 defining monoidial axioms (closure, associativity, identity) and nothing else is called a *free or pure monoid*. This is somewhat contrasted by a monoid in general, which may be any algebraic structure that upholds the 3 monoidal axioms, e.g. every (Abelian) group is also a monoid, but a magma and a semigroup as well.

## Universal algebra
Universal (or more rarely general) algebra is the field of mathematics that studies algebraic structures themselves, as opposed to studying the examples or "models" of algebraic structures. For instance, rather than focusing on a particular group, universal algebra studies the class of groups instead.
