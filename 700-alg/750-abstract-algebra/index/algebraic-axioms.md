# Index of algebraic axioms

An algebraic structure is a carrier set endowed with a set of operations and relations, all of which work together to uphold a set of prescribed axioms. From this definition we can extract the components which are

This is an index of the algebraic axioms.

The underlying set can be composed of any math objects. 
The set of operations spans from a single binary operation that combines the set elements in some way, or 2 binary operations that behave similarly to addition and multiplication and are therefore called additive `+` and multiplicative operation `⨯`.


Algebraic operations
- an operation `⨀`
- additive operation (addition), `+`
- multiplicative operation (multiplication), `⨯`, `∙`, or juxtaposition
- closure operation, `◌⃰`, `_⃰`, `a⃰`, `b⃰`

Distinguished elements
- identity element, `1` or `ε`
  - a unique element that acts as neutral in an operation
  - left identity
- zero element, `0`
  - cancellative
- inverse element, `a⁻¹`
  - each element `a` has a unique inverse element
  `∀ a ∈ S. !∃ a⁻¹. a ⨀ a⁻¹ = ε = a⁻¹ ⨀ a`
- closure operation
  - special operation in closed semi-groups
  - `a⃰ = 1 + a + a⃰`

  - `a = a ⨀ a`

Relations of algebras
- equivalence = refl + symm + trans
  - congruence relation
- preorder = refl + trans + antisymm
- partial order = preorder + 

A poset consists of a set together with a binary relation indicating that, for certain pairs of elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other in the ordering
