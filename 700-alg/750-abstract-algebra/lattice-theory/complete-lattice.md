# Complete lattice

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice

>A **complete lattice** is a poset in which all subsets have both a supremum (join) and an infimum (meet).

A lattice that satisfies at least one of these properties for bounded subsets is known as a **conditionally complete lattice**.

For comparison, in a general lattice, only pairs of elements need to have a supremum and an infimum. Every non-empty finite lattice is complete, but infinite lattices may be incomplete.

Complete lattices appear in many applications in mathematics and computer science. Being a special instance of lattices, they are studied both in order theory and universal algebra.

Complete lattices must not be confused with complete partial orders (cpos), which constitute a strictly more general class of partially ordered sets. More specific complete lattices are complete Boolean algebras and complete Heyting algebras (locales).
