# Division lattice

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_lattice

Division (or divisor) lattice is an *infinite* *complete* *bounded* *distributive* lattice whose elements are the natural numbers ordered by divisibility. Its *least element* is `1`, which divides all natural numbers, while its *greatest element* is `0`, which is divisible by all natural numbers. The meet `∧` operation is gcd, while the join `∨` operation is lcm.

The prime numbers are precisely the *atoms of the division lattice*, namely those natural numbers divisible only by themselves and 1.

For any square-free number `n`, its divisors form a *Boolean algebra* that is a *sublattice* of the division lattice. The elements of this sublattice are representable as the subsets of the set of prime factors of `n`.

A **square-free element** is an element `r` of a unique factorization domain `R` that is not divisible by a non-trivial square. This means that every `s` such that `s²|r` is a unit of `R`.
