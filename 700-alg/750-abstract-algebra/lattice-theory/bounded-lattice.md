## From semilattices to lattices

The lattice theory aims to axiomatize
- Set algebra `(ùí´(X), ‚à™, ‚à©)` and 
- Boolean logic `({T ,F}, ‚à®, ‚àß)`

It starts with the notion of semilattices,
- meet-semilattices, ‚à®-semilattices
- join-semilattices, ‚àß-semilattices

which are sets equipped with a single binop that satisfy these 3 axioms:
1. Associativity
2. Commutativity
3. Idempotence

Adding the fourth axioms of absorption defines a lattice `(B, ‚à®, ‚àß)` as a poset that satisfies al 4 axioms:
1. Associativity
2. Commutativity
3. Idempotence
4. Absorption

## Identity

On the way toward Boolean algebra (BA) we have started with semilattices (assoc, comm, idempotence), then defined lattices (assoc, comm, idempotence, absorption), but there is still a concept that is missing to arrive at BA - that of **identity**.

Consider a division lattice, `[n]`, where n = 24.

```
  24
 ‚üã  ‚üç
8     12
‚îÇ   ‚üã ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚üã   ‚îÇ
4     6
‚îÇ   ‚üã ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚üã   ‚îÇ
2     3
  ‚üç ‚üã
   1
```

Note that `d ‚à® 1 = d` and `d ‚àß 24 = d` for all divisors of 24, `d|24`.

In general, for all elements of a division lattice L = [n], we have identities:
- ‚àÄd ‚àà L. d ‚à® ‚ä§ = d
- ‚àÄd ‚àà L. d ‚àß ‚ä• = d

That is, these lattices have identity elements.


A lattice `L` is a **bounded lattice** if the following additional axiom is satisfied by the binops (beside the 4 lattice axioms):

5. *Identity*: there exists elements 0,1 ‚àà L such that

    ‚àÄx ‚àà L. ‚àÉ0 ‚àà L. x ‚à® 0 = x
    ‚àÄx ‚àà L. ‚àÉ1 ‚àà L. x ‚àß 1 = x

That is, each binop has its own (unique) identity element.

With lattices, it is customary to think of `‚à®` as `+`, and `‚àß` as `√ó`, like with rings, as there are many analogs between the two. As such, the ‚à®-identity is 0-like, and the ‚àß-identity is 1-like, hence the notation above.
- ‚àß-identity: 1
- ‚à®-identity: 0

With respect to the partial order associated with a lattice, note that

    0 ‚à® x = x  ‚áî  0 ‚â§ x

>Thus, if a lattice has a ‚à®-identity, then that identity is the *minimum* element of the lattice.

And similarly, since

    1 ‚àß x = x  ‚áî  x ‚â• 1

The __‚àß-identity is the maximum element__ of the lattice.

The __‚à®-identity is the minimum element__ of the lattice.

>Conversely, if a minimum or maximum element exists in a lattice, they must necessarily be the respective identities.

Hence, the name bounded lattice.


Let `L` be a bounded lattice. Then for all `‚àÄx ‚àà L`

    x ‚à® 1 = 1   and
    x ‚àß 0 = 0

>The identities of binops are the dominant elements of their dual ops.


Proof:

Note `1 ‚à® x = 1 ‚à® (1 ‚àß x) = 1`, where the first equality follows from 1 being the ‚àß-identity and the second equality follows from absorption. The second statement is proven by duality.

## Bounded lattices and bounded infinite lattices

Not all lattices are bounded, but *all finite lattices are necessarily bounded*.

For example, consider `(‚Ñ§, max, min)`, which is a lattice which is not bounded as there is no maximum or minimum integer.

Of course, identities can be easily included to extend the lattice to a bounded lattice, that is, `‚Ñ§ ‚à™ {¬±‚àû}` is a **bounded infinite lattice** with respect to `max` and `min` ops.

Additionally, `(ùí´ X, ‚à™, ‚à©)` is a bounded lattice where `0 = ‚àÖ` and `1 = X`, which is infinite iff `X` is infinite.

## Single-identity lattices

Also, there are lattices with a single identity, lacking the second identity.

For example, `(‚Ñ§·ê©, lcm, gcd)` is a lattice with join-identity only (1), but no meet-identity.

Note: this is a weird consequence of notation: the join-identity (typically denoted 0), is here `1`, not to be confused with the meet-identity (typically denoted as 1). This motivates alternative notation of `O` for join-identity and `I` for meet-identity.

## Bounded-below and bounded-above

A lattice is **bounded from below** (or bounded-below) if it has a meet-identity but not necessarily a join-identity.

A lattice is **bounded from above** (or bounded-above) if it has a joun-identity but not necessarily a meet-identity.

These two notions are independent of each other.

An e.g. bounded-below lattice may be extended to a bounded lattice by adjoining a meet-identity, such as `(‚Ñï, lcm, gcd)` (in this lattice, 0=1 and 1=0).
