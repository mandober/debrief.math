# Algebra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra

**Algebra**, under a broad consideration, is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Algebra, together with number theory, geometry and analysis forms a large part of math; it is used in many math branches because it studies the topics that frequently occur throughout mathematics. Algebra studies everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions, such as groups, rings, fields.

**Elementary algebra** is similar to arithmetic, but it replaces concrete numbers with variables ranging over numbers in order to focus on the laws governing the manipulation of symbols in equations, rather then their immediate result.

**Abstract algebra**, the advance part of algebra, studies abstractions of mathematical objects into *algebraic structures*, such as a monoid, group, ring, field, etc.

**Boolean algebra**, introduced by George Boole in 1847, is a branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values, `True` and `False`.

**Linear algebra** is concerned with linear equations such as linear functions and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.

**Algebraic topology** uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to a homeomorphism, although usually most classify up to a homotopy equivalence.

**Universal algebra** (sometimes called **general algebra**) studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples/instances/models of algebraic structures. For instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes *the class of groups* as a single object of study. Universal algebra is the formalization of the general theory of algebraic structures. Different classes of algebraic (and non-algebraic) objects, and relations between, them are studied in category theory.

## Meanings of the term algebra

The two primary uses of the word "algebra" is
- to name a branch of mathematics (and its sub-branches)
- to name various abstract mathematical structures

The issues arise because both uses include a category and individual members of that category. This is less of a problem with algebra-as-math-branch, but a real problem with algebra-as-math-structure.

Algebra is a branch of math, but the word also ocurrs in the names of almost all of its sub-branches (Elementary Algebra, Abstract Algebra, etc.). "Title Case" is often used for styling and emphaisis.

In Algebra, and especially in Abstract Algebra, "an algebra" denotes an instance of a particular abstract math structure. For example, "Magma is an algebra". Such uses can be replaced with the phrase "algebraic structure" to disambiguate as necessary (an algebraic structure is an instance of a more general mathematical structure).

An algebraic structure consists of a set endowed with one or more binary operations and a set of axioms. Algebraic structures are organized into several classes: group-like, ring-like, module-like, lattice-like and algebra-like (the last one is a pickle, isn't it). Members of group-like algebras include magma, semigroup, monoid, group.

All of this introduces confusion when we mention the word "algebra", which can be expeled to a degree by minding the use of articles (indefinite or definite) and number (singular and plural).



In math, the term "algebra" has several related meanings:

1. Without an article ("algebra"), it denotes a branch of mathematics. 
   "*Algebra* is a large branch of mathematics."   
   "Elementary algebra is a part of *algebra*."

2. With an indefinite article in the singular form ("an algebra"), or 
   without an article in the plural form ("algebras"), 
   it denotes a specific mathematical structure. 
   "Magma is a kind of *an algebra*."   
   "Loop and quindle are *algebras*."   
   "Semigroup and monoid are group-like *algebras*."

3. With a qualifier (adjective used as a qualifier), 
   it denotes a part of algebra. 
   "Elementary *algebra* is a part of algebra."   
   "Abstract *algebra* too."

4. With article and qualifier, it denotes 
   an instance of a mathematical structure.   
   "A Lie *algebra*",   
   "An associative *algebra*",   
   "A vertex operator *algebra*"

5. A qualifier sometimes carries both meanings, e.g.   
   "Commutative *algebra* is the study of commutative rings, which are commutative *algebras* over the integers"
