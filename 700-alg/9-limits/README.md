epsillon-delta definition of limit
ε-δ definition of limit

**Triangle inequality**: if `a,b ∈ ℝ` then `|a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|`.



- Limit of a function
- Limit: value that a function approaches as its input approaches some value

- Limit of a sequence
- Limit: value that a sequence approaches as the index approaches some value

- `(ε, δ)` definition of limit
Formal definition of the mathematical notion of limit


- One-sided limit: either one of the two limits of a function as a specified point is approached from right below() or from left (above)

- Limit inferior and limit superior

- Limit of a net
- Limit point, in topological spaces


- Cauchy's ε-δ definition of continuity
- Dirac delta function δ(x)
