# Sequences and Series :: Topics

- sequences
- sequence as a function
  - as a mapping
  - as an enumeration
  - as a transformation
  - from domain set ℕ to codomain set ℝ, `f : ℕ → ℝ`
  - it is a functional as it accepts a funarg to apply to each `i`
  - lower and upper bounds are additional arguments
  - although they may have defaults, e.g. lb=0 and ub=∞
  - iterator variable name `i` gets initialized as `let i = lb..ub`
  - which suggests the usefulness of partial application or currying
  - or the use of default arguments when implemented in a PL
- terminology and anatomy of sequences
  - sequence name
  - sequence definition
  - sequence bounds
    - iterator variable name (typically `i`)
    - sequence lower bound (`i=0`)
    - sequence upper bound (`∞`)
    - iterator `i` then iterates through `i=0..∞`
