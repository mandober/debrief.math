# Index of sequence and series properties

Sequence/series properties
- indexing
  - 0-indexing
  - 1-indexing
- finiteness
  - infinite
  - finite
- type of sequences
  - seq of rational numbers
  - seq of reals (most typical)
  - seq of complex numbers
- monotonicity
  - increasing
  - decreasing
  - neither increasing nor decreasing
  - monotonically increasing/decreasing
    - non-strictly `≤` or `≥` (means the same term may succeed itself)
    - strictly `<` or `>` (means the same term may not succeed itself)
- convergent
  - convergent, converging sequence
  - divergent sequence
- Cauchy-ness
  - "A sequence is a Cauchy sequence"
  - "A sequence is not a Cauchy sequence"
- boundedness
  - bounded
  - unbounded
  - bounded from below, lower bound exists (e.g. i=0)
  - bounded from above, upper bound exists (e.g. i=0..∞)
  - squeezed in between other sequences

- interval of convergence
- domain of convergence
- radius of convergence
- center of the series
