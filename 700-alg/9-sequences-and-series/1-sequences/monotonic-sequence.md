# Monotonic sequence

- monotonically increasing sequence, a₁/a₂ < 1
- monotonically decreasing sequence, a₁/a₂ > 1
- non-monotonic

>If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it converges.

If the first derivative of a function f(x) is negative then the function (and a sequence defined by it) is decreasing; if positive, it is increasing.
- f′(x) < 0 ⇒ decreasing
- f′(x) > 0 ⇒ increasing

- a₁ > a₂ ⇒ decreasing sequence
- a₁ < a₂ ⇒ increasing sequence
