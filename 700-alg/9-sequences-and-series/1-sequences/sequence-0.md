# Sequences :: Sequence

## Definition of a sequence

A *sequence* is an ordered collection of terms in which repetition is allowed.

A sequence is an ordered collection of elements, called terms. Unlike sets, sequences support/allow multiplicity of elements. The number of terms in a sequence is called the length of the sequence. Most sequences are infinite, but finite sequences exist as well.

An *infinite sequence* is a sequence with an infinite number of elements.

The main thing with sequences (although they may also be arbitrary) is there is usually a *generating formula* that descibes how to construct any element of the sequence using its index.

In this way, a *sequence is a function* that enumerates the items. It maps natural numbers (used as indices) to terms; it is a map from non-negative integeres to terms.

Typically, the terms are real numbers, so the general type of "sequence as a function" is `ℕ → ℝ`.

These terms are seldom constant (numbers); more often then not, they are expressions (which, when evaluated, would end up as real numbers. However, their evaluation is not the main interest here).

With this in mind, a sequence may be given as that generating formula, e.g. `{n²}`, which makes it clear how to construct the sequenc, except it is not entirely clear at which index it starts.

There is no general consesus at which index should a sequence start.


## Notation

Sequences are often surrounded by braces, e.g. {2,3,3,4,4}.






## Indexing

Since sequences are ordered collections, each element has a stable position, which enables *indexing*, i.e. retrieving elements based on their index (position).

There is no general consesus at which index should a sequence start. Majority of sequences start either at 0 or 1, but starting at a different index is also possible. The starting index is the *lower bound* of the sequence, and it is the constant written underneath the sigma symbol when a sequence is converted into a series.

*The value of a series* is a single number because a series represents the sumation of its terms.



If we have a sequence 
a
a
 such that 
a
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
}
a={1,2,3,4,5}
 then 
a
1
=
1
,
a
2
=
2
,
a
3
=
3...
a1=1,a2=2,a3=3...
. The subscript must be a non-negative integer. Also notice that 
n
n
 starts from one and counts up.
