# Limit of a sequence

- limit exists ⇒ sequence converges
- limit exists but it is ±∞ ⇒ sequence diverges
- limit does not exists (DNE)

A limit may exists and be a constant value in which case the sequence converges to that value. Technically, a sequence also converges to negative or positive infinity, but in those cases we say it diverges. The third possibility is that a limit does not exist (e.g. 1,-1,1,-1,…).

## Absolute Value Theorem For Sequences

lim{n→∞} |aₙ| = 0 ⇒ lim{n→∞} aₙ = 0

If the limit of the absolute value of a sequence (?!) is 0, the the limit of the sequence is zero as well.

## Squeeze Theorem For Sequences

If a limit of a sequence that fits in between two other sequences with a limit, then it also has a limit.
