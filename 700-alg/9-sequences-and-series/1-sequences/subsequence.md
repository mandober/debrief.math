# Subsequence

A subsequence of a sequence is that sequence with some terms left out. Every sequence is a subsequence of itself, so it is possible that no terms are left out. The terms need not be removed contiguously - it is allowed to leave terms here and there, non-contiguously.

```
a = {1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,…}
b = {1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,…}
c = {1,7,11,17,21,27,…}
```

The `b` and `c` above are subsequences of the sequence `a`.

A subsequence is different from an **initial segment of the sequence**. Infinite sequences are often truncated after some term of interest, `N`, so they include the initial segment of the sequence up to (and including) the term `N`.
