# Convergence of sequences

* a sequence is convergent to `a ∈ ℝ` if the terms eventually get arbitrarily close to `a`.
* sequence (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, …) approaches the number 1
* every real number can be written as the limit of a sequence of rationals, e.g. via its decimal expansion (see Completeness of the Real Numbers).
* `π` is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, …), which is increasing. A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of `π`, that is, (3,1,4,1,5,9,…). Unlike the preceding sequence, this sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by inspection (especially when the whole number before the decimal dot gets excluded).
* `|a| < b` ⇒ `-a < b < a`, the former is used as a shorter way to express the bounds of some number `b` stating that is bound between the negative and positive value `a`, i.e. in between the `a` and its negation (negation is inverse as it's typically used with integers for `a`).
* Given a very small but positive real number `ε`, the range from `a-ε` to `a+ε` is called the *neighbourhood of ε*, and, eventually, all sequence members need to lie in that region for `a` to be the *limit of the sequence*; only finitely many members may lie outside of it.
* After an index `N`, identifying the sequence member `aɴ`, all the subsequent members of the sequence must lie within the *ε region*, `(aɴ﹢₁, aɴ﹢₂, …)`.
* A sequence is *convergent* to `a ∈ ℝ` if `∃ε > 0`, `∃N.∀n ≥ N`. `|aₙ-a| < ε`. This must work for any `ε`. Choosing a smaller `ε`
