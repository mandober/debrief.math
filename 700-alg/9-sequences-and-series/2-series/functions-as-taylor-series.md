# Functions as Taylor series

The **Taylor series** (or Taylor expansion) of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's *derivatives* at a single point.

Almost every (resonable) function can be represented as a Taylor series.

The Taylor series of a real-valued function `f(x)`, that is infinitely differentiable at a real number `a`, is the power series
