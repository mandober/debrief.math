# Analytic function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function


If `f (x)` is given by a convergent power series in an open interval on the real line centred at `b`, it is said to be analytic in this region.

Thus for `x` in this region, `f` is given by a convergent power series

```js
        ∞
       ⎲
f(x) = ⎳ aₙ(x - b)ⁿ
       ⁿ⁼⁰
```
