## Fractional Sums

As a teenager, I have developed a theory of "fractional sums" - a way to extend the definition of sums like  to non-integer numbers z. It turns out that there is an essentially unique way of doing so, for a large class of functions f, if one demands that the usual calculation rules for sum series and a certain continuity property remain valid. Not only does this extend all well-known identitites for finite sums (such as the geometric or binomial series, sums of polynomials, and the interpolation of the factorial by the Gamma function), but it also produces many interesting and beautiful relations to special functions and constants that are invisible in the case of integer z. See the formula gallery below for a selection. -- Markus P. MÃ¼ller

Abstract. Starting from a small number of well-motivated axioms, we derive a unique definition of sums with a noninteger number of addends. These "fractional sums" have properties that generalize well-known classical sum identities in a natural way. We illustrate how fractional sums can be used to derive infinite sum and special functions identities; the corresponding proofs turn out to be particularly simple and intuitive.
