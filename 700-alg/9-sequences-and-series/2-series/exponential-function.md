# Exponential function

The exponential function, `exp(x) = eˣ`, is a unary function that takes an argument `x` which it uses as an exponent to raise `e` to.
- exp(0) = e⁰ = 1
- exp(1) = e¹ = 2.72 ≈ `e`
- exp(2) = e² = 7.39
- exp(ln(x)) = x
- ln(exp(x)) = x

`exp` and `ln` are each other's inverses.
