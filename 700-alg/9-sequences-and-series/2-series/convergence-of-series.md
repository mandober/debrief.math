# Convergence of series

## Divergence test

If the limit of a sequence `aₙ` is not 0, the corresponding series diverges. 
If the limit of `aₙ` is 0, the corresponding series may converge or diverge.

- lim{n→∞} aₙ ≠ 0 ==> Σaₙ diverges
- lim{n→∞} aₙ = 0 ==> Σaₙ inconclusive (may diverge or converge)

>If the limit of a sequence is not 0, the corresponding series diverges.

## Integral test

If the integral converges then the corresponding series also converges. 
If the integral diverges the series also does.

    ∫{1..∞} f(x) dx converges ⇒ Σ{n=1..∞} aₙ converges


f(x) = 1/x then the integral is: 
∫{1..∞} 1/x dx = lim{a→∞} ln x |ᵃ₁ = ln a - ln 1 = ∞ - 0 = ∞
the integral diverges so the harmonic series does too.
