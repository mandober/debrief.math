# Taylor Series

**Taylor series** or **Taylor expansion** of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's *derivatives* at a single point (denoted `a`). For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point (`a`).

*Maclaurin series* is a Taylor series when `a=0`, i.e. Maclaurin series always considers derivatives at the fixed point, i.e. when `a` is 0.

The partial sum formed by the first `n+1` terms of a Taylor expansion is a polynomial of degree `n`, called the *nth Taylor polynomial* of the function. Taylor polynomials are approximations of a function, which become generally more accurate as `n` increases. *Taylor's theorem* gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such approximations.

If the Taylor series of a function is convergent, its sum is the limit of the infinite sequence of the Taylor polynomials. 
>A function may differ from the sum of its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series is convergent.

A *function is analytic at a point* `x` if it is equal to the sum of its Taylor series in some *open interval* containing `x`. This implies that the function is analytic at every point of the interval.
