# Boolean algebra

* Boolean algebras are models of the equational theory of two values.

* Examples of Boolean algebras: `The algebra of binary digits` under the logical operations (disjunction, conjunction, negation). Applications: propositional calculus, theory of digital circuits. `The algebra of sets` under the set operations (union, intersection, complement).

* All finite Boolean algebras share the same theorems and have a decidable first-order theory.

* Boolean algebra treats the equational theory of the maximal two-element finitary algebra, called the Boolean prototype, and the models of that theory, called Boolean algebras.

* An algebra (or algebraic structure) is a mathematical structure consisting of 3 components: an underlying (or carrier) set, a family of operations on the set, and a set of axioms they together satisfy.

## Boolean algebra as a tuple

Boolean algebra is a 6-tuple (ùîπ, ¬¨, ‚à®, ¬¨, ‚ä•, ‚ä§)

- the carrier set $$\mathbb{B}$$, equipped with operations:
- join        (and)   binary operator    , ¬¨
- meet        (or)    binary operator    , ‚à®
- complement  (not)   unary operator     , ¬¨
- bottom      (least)    element         , ‚ä•
- top         (greatest) element         , ‚ä§

such that ‚àÄabc ‚àà ùîπ these axioms hold:
- associativity : a ‚à® (b ‚à® c) = (a ‚à® b) ‚à® c, a ‚àß (b ‚àß c) = (a ‚àß b) ‚àß c
- commutativity : a ‚à® b = b ‚à® a, a ‚àß b = b ‚àß a
- distributivity: a ‚à® (b ‚àß c) = (a ‚à® b) ‚àß (a ‚à® c), a ‚àß (b‚à®c) = (a‚àßb) ‚à® (a‚àßc)
- identity :      a ‚à® 0 = a,  a ‚àß 1 = a
- absorption:     a ‚à® (a ‚àß b) = a, a ‚àß (a ‚à® b) = a
- complement:     a ‚à® ¬¨a = 1, a ‚àß ¬¨a = 0
