## Polynomial

- `y = x² - 6x + 8`     function-equation
- `f(x) = x² - 6x + 8`  named function
- `0 = x² - 6x + 8`     equation

A polynomial, like this quadratic polynomial equation `y = x² - 6x + 8` has, like any equation, two sides. The right-hand side of this polynomial is what we want to discuss, that is, the side with the variable `y` alone.

By convention, variable `y` represents output values of a function `f` with `x` representing its inputvalues values. This `y` is often consider "generic", in that many math apps allow defining multiple equations/function with isolated `y` on one side without conflicts; i.e. all such equations are distinct. For instance, in the popular graphing web app "desmos", we can define equations that represent functions really, but we cannot refer to such function (they are in a way generic and also anonymous). To be able to reference a function in another "cell" (à la notebook apps), we must give the function a unique name, which as the form like `f(x)`.

This family of expressions is related to a certain polynomial:
-    y = ax² + bx + c     is anonymous equation-function
-        ax² + bx + c     is anonymous expression-equation
- f(x) = ax² + bx + c  is a properly named function-equation
-    0 = ax² + bx + c     are the 2 roots, solutions of this polynomial



A expression is technically a polynomial function if the rhs is


## Generic polynomial notation

A generic notation for a quadratic polynomial is understood to be

    ax² + bx + c

where a,b,c are coefficient which may also be denoted as

    a₀x² + a₁x + a₂

that is, as a parameter `a` indexed by increasing nonnegative integers.
