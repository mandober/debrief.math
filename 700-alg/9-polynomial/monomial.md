# Monomial

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial

>A **monomial** is a polynomial with a single term.

Two definitions of a monomial may be encountered:

1. A monomial, also called *power product*, is a product of powers of variables with nonnegative integer exponents, or, in other words, a product of variables, possibly with repetitions.

For example, `x²yz³ = xxyzzz` is a monomial. The constant `1` is a monomial, being equal to the *empty product* and to `x⁰` for any variable x`.

If only a single variable `x` is considered, this means that a monomial is either `1` or a power `xⁿ` of `x`, with `n` a positive integer.

If several variables are considered, say, `x`, `y`, `z`, then each can be given an exponent, so that any monomial is of the form `xᵃyᵇzᶜ` with `a`, `b`, `c` being non-negative integers.

2. A monomial is a monomial in the first sense multiplied by a nonzero constant, called the *coefficient of the monomial*. A monomial in the first sense is a special case of a monomial in the second sense, where the coefficient is `1`. For example, in this interpretation `(3 - 4i)x⁴yz¹³` and `-7x⁵` are monomials (in the second example, the variables are `x`, `y`, `z`, and the coefficient is a complex number).


In the context of *Laurent polynomials* and *Laurent series*, the exponents of a monomial may be negative, and in the context of *Puiseux series*, the exponents may be rational numbers.

Since the word "monomial", as well as the word "polynomial", comes from the late Latin word "binomium" (binomial), by changing the prefix "bi-" (two in Latin), a monomial should theoretically be called a "mononomial". "Monomial" is a syncope by haplology of "mononomial".
