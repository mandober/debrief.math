# Polynomials :: Terminology

A polynomial is an algebraic expression consisting of
- *variables* (indeterminates or unknows) and
- *coefficients* (knowns, constants)
that combines the terms using only the operations of
- addition (subtraction)
- multiplication (division)
- exponentiation (but the power must be a positive integer, ℕᐩ)

Polynomials, symbolically: `{ +, ⨯, ◌ⁿ (n ∈ ℕᐩ) over ℝ, ℂ, … }`

Polynomial is an algebraic expression of the form

    aₙxⁿ + ... + a₃x³ + a₂x² + a₁x + a₀

A polynomial consists of **terms** which are individual expressions connected by addition. Each term consists of a **constant** (coefficient) and a **variable** (unknown, indeterminate) raised to a power. The terms are usually referenced starting with the *lowest term*, which is one on the right and it is usually only a constant. The *highest term* is the rightmost one with a variable that is raised to the highest power (compared to other terms' variables), which also represents the *degree* of the entire polynomial.



General form of a polynomial of one variable:

    cₙ xⁿ + cₙ˗₁ xⁿ⁻¹ + … + c₁ x + c₀
