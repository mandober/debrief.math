- a quadratic polynomial function, `f(x) = ax² + bx + c`
- a quadratic polynomial equation, `0 = ax² + bx + c`
- a quadratic polynomial inequations:
  - `0 < ax² + bx + c`
  - `f(x) < ax² + bx + c`
  - `y >= ax² + bx + c`


Setting a polynomial function `f(x)` to 0 converts a polynomial function into a polynomial equation.

*Quadratic relation* is a polynomial equation where the highest term has degree 2; it is a polynomial of degree 2. (the term "relation" is probably meant to denote equalities and equations, inequalities and inequations).

Quadratic polynomial, `a₀ + a₁x + a₂x²`, or `ax² + bx + c`. It has degreee 2.

Quadratic formula: `x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a`

```js
// A Quadratic polynomial
ax² + bx + c = 0

// can be solved using quadratic formula:

    -b ± √(b² - 4ac)
x = ----------------
          2a
```
