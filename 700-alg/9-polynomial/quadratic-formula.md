# Quadratic formula

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula

In elementary algebra, the quadratic formula is a closed-form expression describing the solutions of a quadratic equation.

Other ways of solving quadratic equations, such as *completing the square*, yield the same solutions.

Given a general quadratic equation of the form ⁠`ax² + bx + c = 0`, with ⁠`x`⁠ representing an unknown, and coefficients ⁠`a⁠,b,c` representing parameters (known real or complex numbers) with ⁠`a ≠ 0`, the values of ⁠`x` satisfying the equation, called the *roots* or *zeros*, can be found using the quadratic formula,

```js
// quadratic polynomial
ax² + bx + c = 0

// quadratic formula
    -b ± √(b² - 4ac)
x = ----------------
          2a
```

The plus-minus symbol, `±`, indicates that the equation has *two roots*.

The quantity `⁠Δ = b² − 4ac`⁠ is known as the **discriminant of the quadratic equation**. If the coefficients ⁠⁠`a⁠,b,c ∈ ℝ` then
- when ⁠`Δ > 0` the equation has *two distinct real roots*
- when ⁠`Δ = 0` the equation has *one repeated real root*
- when ⁠`Δ < 0` the equation has *no real roots*, but has two distinct complex roots, which are *complex conjugates* of each other.

Geometrically, the roots represent the ⁠`x` values at which the graph of the quadratic function ⁠`y = ax² + bx + c`, a parabola, crosses the ⁠x⁠-axis: the graph's *⁠x⁠-intercepts*. The quadratic formula can also be used to identify the parabola's *axis of symmetry*.
