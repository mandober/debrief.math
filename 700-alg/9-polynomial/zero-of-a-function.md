# Zero of a function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function

A *zero* or *root* of a function `f`, is a member `x` of the domain of `f` such that `f(x)` vanishes at `x`; that is, the function `f` attains the value of 0 at `x`, or equivalently, `x` is a solution to the equation `f(x)=0`.

>A "zero" of a function is an input value that produces an output of 0.

A root of a polynomial is a zero of the corresponding polynomial function.

The fundamental theorem of algebra shows that any non-zero polynomial has a number of roots at most equal to its degree, and that the number of roots and the degree are equal when one considers the complex roots (or more generally, the roots in an algebraically closed extension) counted with their multiplicities.

For example, the polynomial `f` of degree two, `f(x) = x²−5x+6 = (x−2)(x−3)` has the two roots (or zeros), 2 and 3. That is, plugging in 2 or 3 for x gives the result 0.

If the function maps real numbers to real numbers, then its zeros are the x-coordinates of the points where its graph cuts the x-axis. An alternative name for such a point `(x, 0)` in this context is an *x-intercept*.

## Solution of an equation

Every equation in the unknown x may be rewritten as f(x)=0 by regrouping all the terms in the left-hand side. It follows that the solutions of such an equation are exactly the zeros of the function f. In other words, a "zero of a function" is precisely a "solution of the equation obtained by equating the function to 0", and the study of zeros of functions is exactly the same as the study of solutions of equations.

## Polynomial roots

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_polynomial_roots

Every real polynomial of odd degree has an odd number of real roots (counting multiplicities); likewise, a real polynomial of even degree must have an even number of real roots. Consequently, real odd polynomials must have at least one real root (because the smallest odd whole number is 1), whereas even polynomials may have none.

This principle can be proven by reference to the *intermediate value theorem*: since polynomial functions are continuous, the function value must cross zero, in the process of changing from negative to positive or vice versa (which always happens for odd functions).

## Fundamental theorem of algebra

The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial of degree `n` has `n` complex roots, counted with their multiplicities. The non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs. *Vieta's formulas* relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

## Computing roots

There are many methods for computing accurate approximations of roots of functions, a well-known one being *Newton's method*. For polynomials, there are specialized algorithms that are more efficient and may provide all roots or all real roots. Some polynomial, including all those of degree no greater than 4, can have all their roots expressed algebraically in terms of their coefficients.

## Zero set

The *zero set of a function* is the set of all its zeros. 
More precisely, if `f : X → ℝ` is a real-valued function (or, more generally, a function taking values in some additive group), its zero set is `f⁻¹(0)`, the inverse image of {0} in `X`.

Under the same hypothesis on the codomain of the function, a level set of a function f is the zero set of the function `f − c` for some `c` in the codomain of f.

>The zero set of a linear map is also known as its *kernel*.

The *cozero set of the function* `f : X → ℝ` is the complement of the zero set of f (i.e. the subset of X on which f is nonzero).
