# Polynomials

- monomial: a polynomial with only a single term, e.g. x², 1, 3x³
- binomial: a polynomial with 2 terms, e.g. x² + x, 1 - x, 3x³ + 2
- trinomial: a polynomial with 3 terms, e.g. x² + 2x - 1
- sparse polynomial: a polynomial with terms of some powers missing, x³+1
- full polynomial: `a₀x⁰ + a₁x¹ + a₂x² + a₃x³ + ⋯`
- infinite polynomial: `a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + a₃x³ + ⋯`
- coefficients: multiplier constants, `a₀` is the first coefficient
- degree of a term: the exponent of the term (x³ has degree 3)
- leading term: the term with the highest degree
- leading coefficient: the coefficient of the leading term
- degree of a polynomial: eqauls the degree of the leading term
- standard form: fallimg or raising sequence of terms by power
- mutli-variable polynomial (MVP): x³ + 3x²y + 3xy² + y³
- MVP degree of the leading term: add the powers on vars to determine
- 3x²y has degree 3 (x²y¹ so 2+1)
- factoring, long division, synthetic division of polynomials
