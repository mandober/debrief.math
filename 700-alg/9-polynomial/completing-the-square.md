The goal of "completing the square" is to find the last term of a perfect square trinomial. A **perfect square trinomial** is a polynomial that you get by squaring a binomial.

Examples of perfect square trinomials
- x² + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)²
- x² + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)²
- x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²

These are not perfect square trinomials
- x² + 3x +  2 = (x + 1)(x + 2)
- x² + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)
- x² + 9       = (x + 3)(x - 3)
