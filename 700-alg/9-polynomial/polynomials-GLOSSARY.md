# Polynomials :: GLOSSARY



## Indeterminate
Indeterminate (aka variable)

## Coefficient
A coefficient in each term of a polynomial is a constant that multiplies the variable.

## Term
Each term in a polynomial consists of a coefficient and a variable (aka indeterminate) joined by multiplication. The variable is raised to a power `n`, qualifying the entire term as having the degree `n`.

## Polynomial
A polynomial is a mathematical expression consisting of a finite number of terms connected by addition (subtraction). A term consists of a coefficient that multiplies the variable (aka indeterminate) which is raised to a power `n` (where `n` is a nonnegative integer), qualifying the entire term as having the degree `n`.

## Zero polynomial
Zero polynomial is any polynomial in which all the variables have a coefficient equal to zero. Therefore, the value of a zero polynomial is 0. Hence, like there are other constants in a polynomial, 0 can also be considered a constant polynomial.
