# Abstract algebra :: GLOSSARY

## Free object
A free object - in particular, a free algebra - is an algebraic structure that upholds only the defining axioms of that algebra and nothing else. For example, a monoid that upholds the 3 defining monoidial axioms (closure, associativity, identity) and nothing else is called a *free or pure monoid*. This is somewhat contrasted by a monoid in general, which may be any algebraic structure that upholds the 3 monoidal axioms, e.g. every (Abelian) group is also a monoid, but a magma and a semigroup as well.

## Least upper bound
Least upper bound (LUB)

## Greatest lower bound
Greatest lower bound (GLB)

## Greatest element
In order theory, the *greatest element* (dual of the least element) of a subset S of a partially ordered set is an element of S that is greater than every other element of S.

## Least element
In order theory, the *least element* (dual of the greatest element) of a subset S of a partially ordered set is an element of S that is smaller than every other element of S.

## Logarithmically convex
A function is logarithmically convex if its logarithm is convex, i.e. the second derivative of its logarithm is positive.

## Maximum
In set theory, the maximum of a set is the greatest element in the set. Unbounded infinite sets, such as ℝ, have no maximum.

## Minimum
In set theory, the minimum of a set is the least element in the set. Unbounded infinite sets, such as ℝ, have no minimum.

## Maxima and minima
Maxima and minima are also defined for sets. In general, if an ordered set `S` has a greatest element `m`, then `m` is a *maximal element* of the set, also denoted as `max(S)`.

Furthermore, if `S` is a subset of an ordered set `T` and `m` is the *greatest* element of `S` with respect to order induced by `T`, then `m` is a *least upper bound* of `S` in `T`.

Similar results hold for *least* element, *minimal* element and *greatest lower bound*.

In the case of a *general partial order*, the *least element* (i.e. one that is smaller than all others) should not be confused with a *minimal element* (compared to which nothing is smaller).

Likewise, a *greatest element* of a poset is an *upper bound* of the set which is contained within the set, whereas a *maximal element* `m` of a poset `A` is an element of `A` such that if `m ≤ b` (∀b ∈ A), then `m = b`.

Any *least element* or *greatest element* of a poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements.

If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.

In a toset (totally ordered set), or chain, all elements are mutually comparable, so such a set can have at most one *minimal* element and at most one *maximal* element. Then, due to mutual comparability, the *minimal* element will also be the *least* element, and the *maximal* element will also be the *greatest* element. Thus, in a totally ordered set, we can simply use the terms *minimum* and *maximum*.

If a chain is finite, then it will always have a maximum and a minimum. If a chain is infinite, then it need not have a maximum or a minimum. For example, the set of natural numbers has no maximum, though it has a minimum. If an infinite chain S is bounded, then the closure Cl(S) of the set occasionally has a minimum and a maximum, in which case they are called the greatest lower bound and the least upper bound of the set S, respectively.

## Lattice
A lattice consists of a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has a unique supremum (aka least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (aka greatest lower bound or meet); that is, a lattice is a poset that is both a meet- and join-semilattice wrt the partial order.

Algebraically, a lattice is a set with two associative, commutative idempotent binary operations linked by corresponding absorption laws.

## Join semilattice
A join-semilattice (or upper semilattice) is a partially ordered set that has a join (`∨`, or Least Upper Bound) for any nonempty finite subset. Every join-semilattice is a meet-semilattice in the inverse order and vice versa.

## Meet semilattice
A meet semilattice (or lower semilattice) is a partially ordered set which has a meet (`∧`, or Greatest Lower Bound) for any nonempty finite subset. Every meey-semilattice is a join-semilattice in the inverse order and vice versa.

## Semilattice
A semilattice is a set equipped with a binary operation which is associative and commutative and such that all elements are idempotent. This generalizes the notion of a collection of sets equipped with the union operation. Semilattices always form a natural partially ordered set.

Algebraically, a semilattice is defined as: join and meet are associative, commutative, idempotent binary operations, and any such operation induces a partial order (and the respective inverse order) such that the result of the operation for any two elements is the Least Upper Bound (respectively, Greatest Lower Bound) of the elements with respect to this partial order.

## Universal algebra
Universal (or more rarely general) algebra is the field of mathematics that studies algebraic structures themselves, as opposed to studying the examples or "models" of algebraic structures. For instance, rather than focusing on a particular group, universal algebra studies the class of groups instead.
