# Tensors

1. A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers.
- scalars (rank 0 tensors)
- vectors (rank 1 tensors)
- matrices (rank 2 tensors), 2-dimensional arrays of numbers
- rank 3 tensors

So any multi-dimensional array of numbers is a tensor. 
These is array definition of tensors.

This definition is actually wrong. And here's why: tensors can be represented as multi-dimensional arrays, but that's not what they fundamentally are. Tensors aren't just a bunch of numbers that we toss together - they actually have real geometrical meaning.

2. (better definition) A tensor is an object that is invariant under a change of coordinates, and has components that change in a "special predictable way" under a change of coordinates.

3. (final definition) A tensor is a collection of vectors and covectors combined together using the tensor product.
