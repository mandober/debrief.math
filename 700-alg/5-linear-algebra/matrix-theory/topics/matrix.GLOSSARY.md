WTF?!
Strictly Triangular Matrix:       elements on diagonal are 0
Strictly Lower Triangular Matrix: elements on diagonal are 0
Strictly Upper Triangular Matrix: elements of diagonal are 0
Unit Triangular Matrix:           elements of diagonal are 1
Unit Lower Triangular Matrix:     elements of diagonal are 1
Unit Upper Triangular Matrix:     elements of diagonal are 1

- transposition of a triangular matrix is triangular
- transposition of a lower triangular matrix is n upper triangular matrix and vice-versa.
- product of two triangular matrices is a triangular matrix
- triangular matrix is invertible iff all entries of diagonal are non-0
- product of two lower/upper triangular matrices is a lower/upper triangular matrix
- inverse of a triangular matrix is triangular
- determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the elements of diagonal

- An invertible matrix can be written as a product of a lower triangular and upper triangular matrix if and only if its leading principal minors are non-zero. This is also known as the LU decomposition.
- In a matrix is both upper and lower triangular, then it is called as a diagonal matrix.
