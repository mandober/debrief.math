# Curve

A curve is a shape (a line) plotted in a coordinate system that represents the graph of some equation, typically of some function.

Not all equations are functions (they fail the vertical test), but many can be represented as, typically two, functions. The graph of the function `f(x) = x²` is a parabola, symmetric around the y-axis and above the x-axis; in fact, the curve touches the x-axis at point (0,0), meaning the x-axis is a tangent of the curve at the point (0,0). When the curve is rotated 90° clockwise with the fulcrum at the origin, it ceises to be a function because the vertical test fails - each `x` point is now associated to two `y` points, save for (0, 0) point. So, when rotated, a function may ceise to be a function. However, this curve can be expressed as a couple of functions, each with a different sign: `±√x`, that is, `f(x) = √x` and `f(x) = -√x`.

The same holds for a circle. The unit circle is defined by equation `x²+y²=1`, which may be split into two functions, `f(x) = ±√(1-x²)`, each with opposing sign.
