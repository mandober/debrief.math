# Algebra :: Elementary Algebra

Elementary algebra is the first step into algebra from number theory. If number theory contains arithmetic that defines elementary arithetic operations, then elementary algebra is the generalization of arithetic that abstracts numbers into variables, then investigates the properties of arithmetic operations for their own sake. This is contrasted by arithmetic which focuses on the end result of operations applied to concrete quantities.
