# Secant line

A *secant*, or a secant line, aka a *chord*, is a line that intersects a circle in two distinct points.

More generally, a secant line intersects a curve in two distinct points.

A tangent line is defined as the limit of secant lines at that point. More preciselky, fixing a point on a curve at which we want to find the tangent (if the curve is continuous) and denoting it by `A = (x₀, y₀)`, any other point `P` on the curve can define a secant line `AP`.

We can fix a point `T = (x₀, y₀)` on the circle and draw a secant line with its other point at `(x, y)` which is also on the curve. As the other point approaches closer and closer to `T`, the secant line represents a better and better approximation of the tangent line. In the limit, the secant line becomes the tangent line at point T.
