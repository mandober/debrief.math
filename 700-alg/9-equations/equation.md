# Equation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation

A **mathematical equation** is a *mathematical formula* 
that expresses the *equality* of 
two *mathematical expressions* 
by connecting them with the *equals sign*.

Note: Within the context of mathematics, by default, there is no need to qualify the terms like equations (formulas, expessions, statements, etc.). We are discussing mathematics, so it's understood it is a freaking "mathematical equation" (and mathematical formula, mathematical expession, mathematical statement, etc.; for math's sake).

An *equation consists of* two expessions connected by equals sign. An equation relates these two expessions, and this relation is called *equality*.
- strict equality, `=`

Inequations relate multiple inequalities, some stricter, some loser:
- strict inequality, `≠`
- strict inequality, `<` less-then
- strict inequality, `>` greater-then
- loose inequality, `≤` less-then-or-equal-to
- loose inequality, `≥` greater-then-or-equal-to


## Introduction

The term "equation" may have subtly different meaning across languages; in French, "l'équation" is assumed to contain variables, while in English, any well-formed formula consisting of expressions related with the equals sign is considered an equation. Equations that do contain variables are called *algebric equations*.

*Solving an equation* that contains one or more variables involves determining which values the variables should take on, such that the *relation of equality* is satisfied.

Almost everything said of equations also goes for *inequations*, except they use `≠` instead of `=`, as well as for *inequalities* that use relational symbols like `≤`, `≥`, etc. instead of `=`.

Equations and inequations could be considered opposite since either `x = y` or `x ≠ y`. Inequalities, on the other hand, incorporate equality with "less then" (`<`) yielding `≤`, or "greater then" (`>`) sign yielding `≥`, so they hold only for numerical values (or sets with a notion of order defined on them).

The unknown quntities for which the equation has to be solved for are represented by letters near the end of the alphabet, and these are called *variables* or *unknowns*. The values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called *solutions of the equation*.

There are two kinds of equations:
- identities
- conditional equations

>An **identity** is an equation that is true for all values of variables. A **conditional equation** is only true for particular values of variables.

The equals sign, `=`, which occurs in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.

## Details

*Commensurability*: in its original sense, it is defined as the absence of a common unit of measurement that would allow a direct and exact measurement of variables.

A **mathematical formula** generally refers to an equation or inequality relating one mathematical expression to another, with the most important ones being mathematical theorems. Formulas form the basis for calculations.

Mathematical formulas are often
- algebraic formulas
- analytical formulas
- closed formulas

In a general context, formulas often represent *mathematical models* of real world phenomena, and as such can be used to provide solutions (or approximate solutions) to real world problems, with some being more general than others.

**Mathematical expressions** are distinct from formulas in the sense that they don't necessarily contain relational like equality or inequality. Expressions constitute parts of equations.

An expression denotes a *mathematical object*, whereas a formula denotes a *mathematical statement* about mathematical objects. 

This is analogous to natural language, where a noun phrase refers to an object, while a whole sentence refers to a fact. For example, `8x − 5` is an expression, while `8x − 5 ≥ 3` is a formula.
