# Square-free element

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-free_element

A **square-free element** is an element `r` of a unique factorization domain `R` that is not divisible by a non-trivial square. This means that every `s` such that `s²∣r` is a unit of `R`.

Common examples of square-free elements include
- square-free integers
- square-free polynomials

## Alternate characterization

Square-free elements may be also characterized using their prime decomposition. The unique factorization property means that a non-zero non-unit `r` can be represented as a product of prime elements `r = p₁ p₂ ⋯ pₙ`.

Then `r` is square-free iff the primes `pᵢ` are pairwise non-associated; i.e. that it doesn't have two of the same prime as factors, which would make it divisible by a square number.
