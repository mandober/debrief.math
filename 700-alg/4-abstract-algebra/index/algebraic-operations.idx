# Algebraic operations

- additive operation
- multiplicative operation
- closure operator
  - in star semiring, closed semiring: `a⃰ = 1 + a + a⃰`
- class operator
- composition
  - in function-space algebra, `(ℱ, id, ∘)`
- concatenation
  - algebra on lists, list monoid: `([S], [], ++)`
  - algebra on strings, string monoid: `(S, "", ++)`
- in algebraic graphs
  - overlay `+`
  - connect `∙`
  - decomposition property: `x∙y∙z = x∙y + x∙z + y∙z`
- Boolean algebra
  - meet, ⋀, ∙
  - join, ⋁, +
- complement operation
