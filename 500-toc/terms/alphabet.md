In formal language theory, a **string** is a finite sequence of symbols, formed by concatenating the elements of an underlying base set; this base set is called the *alphabet of a string*.

The members of the alphabet are called **symbols**, and the written symbols of a natural language are better known as letters, although sometimes the symbols may also be referred to as characters, digits or glyphs.

The **binary alphabet**, `Î£ = {0,1}`, has only two symbols as members, but still, an infinite number of **binary strings** may be formed from it.
