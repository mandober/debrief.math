# Alphabet

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(formal_languages)

In *formal language theory*, a *string* is defined as a finite sequence of members of an underlying base set; this set is called the *alphabet* of a string.

The members of the set are called *symbols*, and they typically represent letters, characters, or digits. For example, a common alphabet is {0,1}, the *binary alphabet*, and a *binary string* is a string drawn from it. An infinite sequence of letters may be constructed from elements of an alphabet.
