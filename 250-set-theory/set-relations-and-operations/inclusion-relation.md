# Inclusion relation

Inclusion relations relate sets, establishing the way they are related as pertaining to the possible inclusion if one set in another.

An *inclusion relation associates sets*, as opposed to the membership relation that associates sets and objects, with objects as potential set members.

Inclusion relations
- subset, superset
- proper subset, proper superset

Subset and proper subset relations do not uphold the same set of axioms. Subset relation is reflexive and transitive, but proper subset is not reflexive.

Inclusion relations
* subset
  - reflexive:  `A ⊆ A`
  - transitive: `(A ⊆ B ⋀ B ⊆ C) => A ⊆ C`
* proper subset
  - irreflexive: A ⊂/ A
  - transitive: `(A ⊂ B ⋀ B ⊂ C) => A ⊂ C`



with regards to the possible overlap of the containment of their elements. In other words, is one set included in the other.

do they have commo

two sets have completely separate  


An inclusion relation is reflexive, transitive, and *anti-symmetric*

A proper inclusion relation is irreflexive, transitive, and *asymmetric*.

inclusion and proper inclusion relations have natural converses;
  A (properly) includes B iff B is (properly) included in A;
  alternatively, A is a (proper) superset of B

exclusion relation is symmetric and anti-reflexive

inclusion relation is antisymmetric
