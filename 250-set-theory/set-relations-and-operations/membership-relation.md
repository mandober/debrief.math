# Membership Relation

A *membership relation associates an object to a set*, establishing whether an object belong to a set.

The fact that an object `a` belongs to a set `A` is denoted by `a ∈ A`, and we say that the object `a` is a member (or an element) of the set `A`.

The fact that an object `a` does not belong to a set `A` is denoted by `a ∉ A`.

Every object wants to have a meaningful sense of belonging to some set, the blissful period in an object's life when a young objects transitions from objecthood to *elementhood*, becoming a hooded member.

A membership relation is unlike an inclusion relation; the latter associates one set to another set, establishing by how much is one knee-deep in the other.

Membership relation is *reflexive* and *anti-transitive*. In this regard it is unlike inclusion relation, which is transitive.

Inclusion relations
* subset
  - reflexive:  `A ⊆ A`
  - transitive: `(A ⊆ B ⋀ B ⊆ C) => A ⊆ C`
* proper subset
  - irreflexive:`A /⊂ A`

(A,A) ∈ 𝓡
(A,B) ∈ 𝓡


a ∈ A
R = a ~ A

∧ b ∈ B

if `a ∈ A` ∧ `b ∈ B` then it is `a ∈ C`


If the predicate `Φ` means "belongs to a set `A`", then the fact that `a ∈ A` can also be stated as `Φ(a)`. We can express something about all elements of a set `A` by begining the formula with `∀a.Φ(a).`
