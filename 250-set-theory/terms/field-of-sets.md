# Field of sets

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_sets

A **field of sets** is a mathematical structure 
consisting of a pair ⟨X, 𝓕⟩ where 
X is a set and 
𝓕 is a family of subsets of X called an algebra over X 
that contains *the empty set* as an element (identity), 
and is closed under the operations of 
taking *complements* in X, 
finite *unions*, and 
finite *intersections*.

Equivalently, an algebra over X 
is a subset 𝓕 of the power set of X such that
- ∅ ∈ 𝓕              (𝓕 has the identity element)
- ∀A ∈ 𝓕. A' ∈ 𝓕     (𝓕 is closed under compliment)
- ∀AB ∈ 𝓕. A \ B ∈ 𝓕 (𝓕 is closed under intersection)
- ∀AB ∈ 𝓕. A ∪ B ∈ 𝓕 (𝓕 is closed under union)
