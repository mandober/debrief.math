Category theory is close to the perfect language. It can be used to describe many mathematical ideas, and see the relations between them, and their deeper structure. This is the first video (of 12) in a course where we will carefully introduce the main ideas of category theory, and motivate them with lots of applications.

In the first video:
- motivation for studying Category Theory
- definition of a category
- definition of a monoid
- definition of a pre-ordered set (preorder)
- definition of category *Set*, of sets and functions
- introduction to functional programming
- definition of the final (terminal) object
- how to do set theory without considering the elements directly
