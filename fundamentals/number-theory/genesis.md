# Genesis

In the beginning there was a void: no objects, no structures, no state, nothing at all, not even a space. Even then, it had potential to become *something* for it was like nothing else that was, or will be. And that was a quite unique feature as it will turn out at the moment one came to be.

As soon as one became, so did the concept of duality and the system became stable for some time for it was the minimal state of affairs needed to start making sense.

We had two states and we could tell each apart with fair certainty - the facts that immediately spawned Boolean algebra. The void was randomly chosen to represent the state "F" and the other was the state "T".

The language influenced the emergence of operators.
