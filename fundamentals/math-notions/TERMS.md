# MATH TERMS



**Primitives** are undefined notions or objects. A mathematical primitive is not defined in terms of previously defined concepts, but described informally by appealing to one's intuition or experience, and expected to be taken for granted. Many fundamental mathematical objects (number, set, space) are primitives.

**Models** are used to approximate notions or objects by identifying and encoding patterns in the data.
