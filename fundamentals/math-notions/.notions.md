# MATH IN GENERAL

Math branches and their subject matter
- Algebra studies *relation*
- Calculus studies *change*



Math notions and objects/elements and their collections.

Math primitives
Math axioms
Math therems
Math lemmas
Math conjectures
Math theories


## Mathematical object
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object
A mathematical object is an abstract object arising in mathematics. The concept is studied in philosophy of mathematics.


# Mathematical notion

Mathematical notion
Mathematical object
Mathematical primitive
Mathematical axiom
Mathematical structure
Mathematical Collections: set multiset sequence tuple


## Mathematical notions

Mathematical notions:
* Undefined
  * Mathematical primitives
  * Mathematical axioms
* Formally defined


Undefined notions:
  - set
  - empty set
  - number
  - space


Formally defined:
  - Natural numbers
  - Relation
  - Functions
    - Successor, $$S(x): x \in \mathbb{Z}$$
    - Predecessor



## Higher-order

**Higher-order functions** are functions that can treat functions (function as language construct) like any other value, e.g. they can accept functions as arguments and return functions.

**Higher-order logics**
- quantifying over *individuals*
- quantifying over *sets of individuals*
- quantifying over *sets of predicates*

*n-order logics*, ZOL » FOL » SOL » HOL
- Zeroth-order logics, n = 0
- First-order  logics, n = 1
- Second-order logics, n = 2
- Higher-order logics, n > 2

FOL,SOL are not higher-order logics.


To achieve **higher-order** you need to start have variables that range over "higher" concepts.

Objects:
* **scalar**: primitive object
* **set**: object container, a set containing (any, if at all) objects

Props:
- a scalar may not contain other objects
- a set may contain objects

Sets:
- *pure set*: a set containing scalars only
- *empty set*: pretty vacant
- *higher-order set*: a set containing set(s)
- *mixed set*:a set known to contain at least one scalar AND at least one set
- *universal set*: set containing everything, the universe

Orders:
- a theoretic language with variables that range over objects is a higher-order language (right?)
