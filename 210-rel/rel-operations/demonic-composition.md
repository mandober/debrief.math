# Demonic composition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonic_composition

In mathematics, demonic composition is an operation on binary relations that is similar to the ordinary composition of relations *but is robust to refinement of the relations into (partial) functions or injective relations*.

Unlike ordinary composition, *demonic composition is not associative*.

## Definition

Let R ⊆ X×Y, 
and S ⊆ Y×Z,   
the **right demonic composition** `R;→S` 
is a relation between X and Z, and its graph is defined as   
`{ (x, z) | x (S ∘ R) z ∧ ∀y ∈ Y(xRy ⇒ ySz) }`
                              ↑     ↑
