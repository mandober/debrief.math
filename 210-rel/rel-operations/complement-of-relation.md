# Complement

If R is a binary relation over sets X and Y then 
`Rᶜ = {(x,y): ¬xRy}` 
is the complementary relation of R over X and Y.

For example, 
- `=` and `≠` are each other's complements
- `⊆` and `⊈` are each other's complements
- `⊇` and `⊉` are each other's complements
- `∈` and `∉` are each other's complements

for total orders, also
- `<` and `≥` are each other's complements
- `>` and `≤` are each other's complements


The complement of the converse relation `Rᵀ` is the converse of the complement: `(Rᵀ)ᶜ = (Rᶜ)ᵀ`


If X=Y, the complement has the following properties:
- if a relation is symmetric, then so is the complement.
- complement of a reflexive relation is irreflexive, and vice versa.
- complement of a strict weak order is a total preorder, and vice versa.
