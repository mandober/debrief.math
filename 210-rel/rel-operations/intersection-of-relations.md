# Intersection of relations

- Intersection of relations is the intersection of their corresponding sets.
- The identity element is the universal relation, `R ‚à© ùí∞ = R`

If R and S are binary relations over sets X and Y then 
`R ‚à© S = {(x,y) | xRy ‚àß xSy }` 
is the intersection relation of relations R and S over sets X and Y.

Examples:
- relation "is divisible by 6" is the intersection of the relations "is divisible by 3" and "is divisible by 2", `6|x = 2|x ‚à© 3|x`
