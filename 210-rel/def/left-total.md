# Left-total

- `∀a ∈ A. ∃b ∈ B. aRb`
- left-total iff for all a ∈ A there exists *at least one* b ∈ B such that aRb
- left-total iff for all a ∈ A there exists *some* b ∈ B such that aRb
- left-totality means all domain elems participate in the relation
- `∀a ∈ A` is key - all dom elems must be engaged
