# Left-unique

- left-unique, injective
- every cod elem has at most one preimg
- 1 incoming arrow per cod elem
- left-uniqueness is the crucial property of injections
- `∀a₁a₂ ∈ A. ∀b ∈ B. (a₁R b ∧ a₂R b) ⇒ a₁ = a₂`
- domain elems have unique preimages
- `∀b ∈ B. !∃a ∈ A. aRb`



Right-Unique iff for all a ∈ A there exists at most one b ∈ B such that aRb
Left-Unique iff for all b ∈ B there exists at most one a ∈ A such that aRb


function       = left-total + right-unique
functional rel = right-unique
injective rel  = left-unique
one-to-one rel = left-unique + right-unique
correspondence = left-total + right-total

A relation that is both 
left-total and right-total 
is called a correspondence;


A relation that is both 
left-unique and right-unique 
is called one-to-one (1-to-1); 
not a function cos it may have 
non-engaged elems in both dom and cod.
