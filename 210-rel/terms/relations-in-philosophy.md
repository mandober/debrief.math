# Relations in philosophy

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations_(philosophy)

## Prelude

**Relations** are ways in which several entities "stand to" each other (this already announces the problem of relations, see *Bradley's regress*).

Relations usually connect distinct entities (*exorelations*, heterogeneous relations), but some relations (*endorelations*, homogeneous relations) associate an entity with itself.

The *arity of a relation* is the number of entities it connects.

The *direction of a relation* is the order in which the entities are related to each other (since relations are usually directional).

The *converse of a relation* carries the same information and has the opposite direction (like the contrast between "2 < 5" and "5 > 2").


Both relations and *properties* express features in reality with a key difference being that relations apply to several entities while properties belong to a single entity.

Many types of relations are discussed in the academic literature.
- *Internal relations*, like `resemblance`, depend only on the monadic properties of the relata. They contrast with
- *External relations*, like `spatial relations`, which express characteristics that go beyond what their relata are like. 
- *Formal relations*, like `identity`, involve abstract and topic-neutral ideas
- *Material relations*, like `loving`, have concrete and substantial contents.
- *Logical relations* are relations between propositions
- *Causal relations* connect concrete events.
- Symmetric, transitive, and reflexive relations are distinguished by their structural features.


Metaphysical difficulties, like the question of *where relations are located*, lie at the center of discussions of their ontological status.
- *Eliminativism* is the thesis that relations are mental abstractions that are not a part of external reality.
- *Reductionism* is a less radical position which claims that relations can be explained in terms of other entities, like monadic properties, and are not a substantial addition to reality.
- *Realists* claim that relations have mind-independent existence.
- *Relationalism* is a strong form of realism which states that all of reality is relational at its most basic level.

Historically, eliminativism and reductionism were the dominant views. This only changed toward the end of the 19th century, when various developments in the fields of mathematics, logic, and science prompted a more realist outlook.

## Definition and essential features

A **relation** is a manner in which multiple entities stand to each other.

A **relation** is a connection or association between entities and can be understood as a feature characterizing these entities as a whole.

Many relations hold between distinct entities. For example, the first-born sibling stands in the relation of being older to their other siblings. But an entity can also stand in a relation to itself. For instance, every entity stands in the relation of identity to itself. Relations can hold between diverse entities, including objects, people, and concepts. If a relation holds between entities then the relation together with the entities constitutes a fact or state of affairs. The word "relationship" is often used as a synonym.

The entities related to each other are called the `relata`. The term "relation" comes from the Latin terms `relatio` and `referre`, which mean reference or towardness.

In mathematics and logic, relations are defined as set-theoretic structures. For example, the relation less than is defined as the set of all ordered pairs in which the first element is less than the second element. This set includes pairs like (1,2), (1,3), and (2,17). Mathematical functions are a special type of relation in which one or several elements are uniquely associated with exactly one other element.

Relations have various characteristic features, like the *arity* (number of relata) they have and the *direction* in which they connect them. 

Relations are closely associated with *properties* and share several aspects with them.
