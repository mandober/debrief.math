This article treats *relations from the perspective of combinatorics*, in other words, as a subject matter in discrete mathematics, with special attention to finite structures and concrete set-theoretic constructions, many of which arise quite naturally in applications.

This approach to *relation theory*, or *the theory of relations*, is distinguished from, though closely related to, its study from the perspectives of abstract algebra on the one hand, and formal logic on the other.

## Preliminaries

When we speak of a function `f : X → Y` we are thinking of a mathematical object whose articulation requires 3 pieces of data, and the sameis for relations.

## Definition

A `k`-place relation `R`, where `k` is a positive integer, `L ⊆ X₁ ⨯ … ⨯ Xₖ` over nonempty sets `Xᵢ`, is defined by k+1-tuple `(X₁, …, Xₖ, L)`, where `L` is a subset of the cartesian product of sets `Xᵢ`.

`R` is the k+1-tuple `(X₁, …, Xₖ, L)` consisting of all domain sets `Xᵢ` along with `L`, which is the *graph of relation* `R`. This is a more accurate definition of relation to the alternative which only condsiders `L` as the relation without accounting for domain sets. However, if the sequence of sets `Xᵢ` is fixed throughout a discussion, then a relation may indeed collapse into it graph `L`.

The sets `Xᵢ` are called *domains of the relation* `L`, with `Xⱼ` being the `j`-th domain. If all `Xᵢ` are the same set then a relation is simply described as a k-place relation over `X`. The set `L` is called *the graph of the relation*.

## Local incidence properties

A **local incidence property** (LIP) of a relation `L` is a property that depends on the properties of special subsets of `L` known as its *local flags*.

These **local flags** of a relation are defined:

Let L be a k-place relation `L ⊆ X₁ ⨯ … ⨯ Xₖ`. 
Select a relational domain `Xⱼ` and one of its elements `x`. 
Then `L {x @ j}` is a subset of `L` that is referred to as the flag of `L` with `x` at `j`, aka the `x` at `j`-flag of `L`, which is an object with the following definition:

L {x @ j} = { (x₁, …, xⱼ, …, xₖ) ∈ L | xⱼ = x }
