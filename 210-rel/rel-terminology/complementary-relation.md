# Complementary relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)#Complementary_relation

A binary relation R is defined as a subset of a product of sets A×B. The *complementary relation* R' is the set complement of R in A×B. The complement of relation R can be written `R' = A×B \ R`.

Here, R is often viewed as a logical matrix with rows representing the elements of A, and columns elements of B. The truth of aRb corresponds to `1` in row a, column b. Producing the complementary relation to R then corresponds to switching all 1s to 0s, and 0s to 1s for the logical matrix of the complement.

Together with *composition of relations* and *converse relations*, complementary relations and the algebra of sets are the elementary operations of the *calculus of relations*.
