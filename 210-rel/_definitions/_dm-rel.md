# Types of Relations

- **Identity relation** on set X is the set { (x,x) | ∀x ∈ X }

- **Inverse** Relation R' of a relation R is defined as − R′={(b,a)|(a,b)∈R}
  Example: If R={(1,2),(2,3)} then R′ will be {(2,1),(3,2)}

- **Reflexive**: relation R on set A is called Reflexive 
  if ∀a∈A is related to a (aRa holds)
  Example: relation R={(a,a),(b,b)} on set X={a,b} is reflexive.

- **Irreflexive**
  relation R on set A is called Irreflexive if no a∈A is related to a 
  (aRa does not hold).
  Example − The relation R={(a,b),(b,a)} on set X={a,b} is irreflexive.

- **Symmetric**
  relation R on set A is called Symmetric if xRy implies yRx, ∀x∈A and ∀y∈A.
  Example − The relation R={(1,2),(2,1),(3,2),(2,3)} on set A={1,2,3} is symmetric.

- **Antisymmetric**
  relation R on set A is called Anti-Symmetric if xRy and yRx implies x=y∀x∈A and ∀y∈A.
  Example − The relation R={(x,y)→N|x≤y} is anti-symmetric since x≤y and y≤x implies x=y.

- **Transitive**
  relation R on set A is called Transitive if xRy and yRz implies xRz,∀x,y,z∈A.
  Example − The relation R={(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)} on set A={1,2,3} is transitive.

- **Equivalence**
  relation is an Equivalence Relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
  Example − The relation R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2),(1,3),(3,1)} on set A={1,2,3} is an equivalence relation since it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
