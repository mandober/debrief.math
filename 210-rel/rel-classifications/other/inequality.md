# Inequality

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_(mathematics)

In mathematics, an **inequality is a relation** which makes a *non-equal comparison* between two numbers or other mathematical expressions.

It is used most often to compare two numbers on the number line by their size. There are several different notations used to represent different kinds of inequalities: `<`, `>` and in either case, a is not equal to b. These relations are known as *strict inequalities*, meaning that `a` is strictly less than or strictly greater than `b`. Equivalence is excluded.

In contrast to strict inequalities, there are two non-strict inequality relations: `≤` or `⩽` (LE, or, equivalently, at most `b`, or not greater than `b`), `≥` or `⩾` (GE, or, equivalently, at least `b`, or not less than `b`).

The relation not greater than can also be represented by `≯ `, the symbol for GREATER THAN bisected by a slash (NOT). The same is true for NOT LESS THAN and `≮ `.

The notation a ≠ b means that a is not equal to b; this inequation sometimes is considered a form of *strict inequality*. It does not say that one is greater than the other; it does not even require `a` and `b` to be member of an ordered set.

In engineering sciences, less formal use of the notation is to state that one quantity is "much greater" than another, normally by several orders of magnitude, `≪` and `≫`. This implies that the lesser value can be neglected with little effect on the accuracy of an approximation (such as the case of ultrarelativistic limit in physics).

In all of the cases above, any two symbols mirroring each other are symmetrical; a < b and b > a are equivalent, etc.

## Properties on the number line
Inequalities are governed by the following properties. All of these properties also hold if all of the non-strict inequalities (≤ and ≥) are replaced by their corresponding strict inequalities (< and >) and, in the case of applying a function, monotonic functions are limited to strictly monotonic functions.

## Formal definitions and generalizations

A (non-strict) partial order is a binary relation `≤` over a set `P` which is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.

That is, `∀abc ∈ P`, it must satisfy the 3 following clauses:
- reflexivity,  `a ≤ a`
- antisymmetry, `a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a -> a = b`
- transitivity, `a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c -> a ≤ c`

A set with a partial order is called a partially ordered set.   
Those are the very basic axioms that every kind of order has to satisfy.   
Other axioms that exist for other definitions of orders on a set `P` include:
- total order: ∀ab ∈ P. `a ≤ b ∨ b ≤ a`
- dense order: ∀ab ∈ P. `a < b -> (∃c ∈ P. a < c < b)`
- least-upper-bound property: every non-empty subset of `P` with an upper bound has a least upper bound (supremum) in `P`
