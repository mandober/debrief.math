# Surjection

A surjection (or surjective or onto function) is a function `f` that every element `y` can be mapped from element `x` so that `f(x) = y`.

In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at least one element of its domain. It is not required that x be unique; the function f may map one or more elements of X to the same element of Y.
