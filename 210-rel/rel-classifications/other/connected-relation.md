# Relations :: Definitions :: Connected relation

A relation `R` on a set `A` has the property of *connectedness*, or is said to be *connected* if

`∀xy ∈ A. x ≠ y ⋁ yRx`

(Note the universal quantifer!)

Or, equivalently,

`∀xy ∈ A. xRy ∨ yRx ∨ x = y`

That is, any two elements in a set `A` are either related (in one way or the other, i.e. `xRy` or `yRx`) or they are the same element, `x = y`.

# Connected relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_relation

A relation on a set `A` is called **connected (total)** if it relates (or "compares") all distinct pairs of elements of the set in one or the other direction.

A relation on a set `A` is called **strongly-connected** if it relates all pairs of elements.

The terminology for these properties is not standardized, so this notion of totality should not be confused with that of a *total (full) relation* that is a set

associates all the set elements with each other.

in the sense that `∀x ∈ X. ∃y ∈ X. xRy`

each element of the set is related to every other element.



More precisely, such relation associates all distinct ordered pairs (temporarily regarded as unorder pairs i.e. sets) of elements of the set either in direction `aRb` or direction `bRa`. For example, with the LE relation either `a <= b` or `b <= a`.

A total relation is called **strongly connected** if it relates *all pairs* of elements.

As described in the terminology section below, the terminology for these properties is not uniform. This notion of "total" should not be confused with that of a total relation in the sense that for all 

x ∈ X there is a y ∈ X so that xRy
