# Contact relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_relation

Suppose `B` is the power set of `A`, the set of all subsets of A. Then a relation `g` is a contact relation if it satisfies these 3 properties:

1. `∀x ∈ A, Y = {x} -> xgY`

2. `Y⊆Z ∧ xgY -> xgZ`

3. `∀y ∈ Y, ygZ ∧ xgY -> xgZ`

The set membership relation, `∈`, satisfies these properties so `∈` is a contact relation.

The notion of a general contact relation was introduced by Georg Aumann in 1970.

In terms of the calculus of relations, sufficient conditions for a contact relation include

`Cᵀ Cᶜ ⊆ ∋ Cᶜ  ≡  (C ∋ Cᶜ)ᶜ ⊆ C`

where `ᶜ` is the complimentary relation, and `∋` is the converse of set membership.
