Properties of relations

- a relation is asymmetric iff it is both antisymmetric and irreflexive.

- Restrictions and converses of asymmetric relations are also asymmetric. For example, the restriction of < from the reals to the integers is still asymmetric, and the inverse > of < is also asymmetric.
- A transitive relation is asymmetric if and only if it is irreflexive: if aRb and bRa, transitivity gives aRa, contradicting irreflexivity.
- As a consequence, a relation is transitive and asymmetric if and only if it is a strict partial order.
- Not all asymmetric relations are strict partial orders. An example of an asymmetric non-transitive, even antitransitive relation is the rock paper scissors relation: if X beats Y, then Y does not beat X; and if X beats Y and Y beats Z, then X does not beat Z.
- An asymmetric relation need not have the connex property. For example, the strict subset relation âŠŠ is asymmetric, and neither of the sets {1,2} and {3,4} is a strict subset of the other. A relation is connex if and only if its complement is asymmetric.
