# Relations :: Classification :: Atomic relations

Atomic relations is an artificial name for the class of relations that are simple or non-compound, i.e. they satisfy a single property (e.g. reflexivity), as opposed to the compound relations which consist of simple relations. For example, equivalence relations are reflexive, symmetric and transitive, meaning they consist of 3 simpler properties.

The 3 of the most important atomic relations, sometimes also called elementary relations, are reflexive, symmetric and transitive relations. Or, the 3 most important properties of relations are reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.
