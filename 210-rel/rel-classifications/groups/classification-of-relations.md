# Relations :: Classification :: Classification of relations

Classification of relations starts with the *general classification* according to the factors that classify relations into broad, mostly bipolar, classes.

General classification
- finitary relations
- infinitary relations
- homogeneous relations (endorelations)
- heterogeneous relations (exorelations)
- binary relations
- ternary relations
- k-ary relations
- n-ary relations
- elementary relations
- atomic relations
- compound relations
- ordering relations


As long as arity is a finite (natural) number, a relation is called *finitary*, as opposed to *infinitary* relations.

A common factor of classification of finitary relations is arity. The most common type of relations are *binary relations* (2-place relations), *ternary relations* are 3-place relations. For a fixed number `k`, there are *k-ary relations*. In general, relations are *`n`-ary relations* (n-place relations).

*Homogeneous relations* are relations on a single set, while *heterogeneous relations* are relations between two or more distinct sets.

A binary relation may be homogeneous, but it may as well be heterogeneous. In fact, an `n`-ary relation may include `n` distinct sets, but it may also be an `n`-place relation on a single set.

In classifying relations, *atomic relations* are a name for the class of standalone, single-property relations (e.g. corefl, antisym, trans), as opposed to *compound relations* that combine two or more atomic relations together (e.g. apartness = irreflex + symm + cotrans).

The 3 elementary atomic relations (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity), along with their derivatives (co-, a-, anti-, etc.), are collected into their own category named *elementary relations*.

The 3 relations that are always possible on an nonempty set - universal relation, identity relation and empty relation - are collected into their own class named *general relations*.

*Equivalence relations* get their own folder as a convenience in order to gather the discussion about them in one place, providing examples, and analysis of its constituent atomic relations (refl, sym, trans).

*Ordering relations* is a class of those compound relations that are considered to be orders.
