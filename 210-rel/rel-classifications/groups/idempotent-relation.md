# Idempotent relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent_relation

An idempotent binary relation is a binary relation R on a set X (a subset of Cartesian product X × X) for which the composition of relations R ∘ R is the same as R. This notion generalizes that of an idempotent function to relations.
