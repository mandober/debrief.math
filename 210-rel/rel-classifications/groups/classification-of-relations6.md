# About the classification of relations

## Classification of relations

Relations are divided, first, into broad or generic vs concrete classes. General relations and Pervasive relations name the two broad classes. After that, relations are divided into various classes of which the class of *Elementary relations* contains the *atomic relations* that are build around reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry.

- General relations: broad relation types
- Ultimate relations: the 3 pervasive relations
- atomic relations: rel that cannot be decomposed further
- compound relations: consist of composed atomic rels (e.g. equivalence rel)
- Elementary relations: basic atomic relations build around reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry. Each of these can appear to hold or to not hold (e.g. there is transitive relation and there is non-transitive relation, which may or may not be equal to antitransitive relation)



### Broad classes of relations

Classification has two types of classes: classes that classify broad, generic relations and classes that classify concrete relations. Very broad properties of relations form the former class; it divides relations from the aspects of properties like arity, homogeneity, finiteness. There are two subclasses here: *general relations* which comprise broad relations, and *pervasive relations* which comprise the 3 relations that always exists - exist on any set.

*General relations*
- by finiteness:
  - finitary relations
  - infinitary relations
- by arity:
  - unary relations
  - binary relations
  - ternary relations
  - k-ary relations
  - n-ary relations
- by types of sets:
  - homogeneous or endorelations
  - heterogeneous or exorelations

*Ultimate (pervasive) relations*
  - universal (total) relation
  - empty (null) relation
  - identity relation
