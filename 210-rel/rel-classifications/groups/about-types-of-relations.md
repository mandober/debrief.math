# About types of relations

- general, generic, broad
- omnipresent, ultimate, pervasive
- binary relations
- finitary relations
- homogeneous, endorelations
- elementary, basic, fundamental
- atomic relations
- compound relations
- equality relations
  - inequality relations
  - equivalence relations
- set-based relations
- order-based relations
- function-based relations

Factors of classification
- by finiteness
- by arity
- by the number of sets: homogeneous, heterogeneous
- by the possibility to illustrate it (symm, trans, dense)
- by the number of vars in a formula that defines it
  - 1 var (x): refl, irrefl
  - 2 vars (xy): symm, antisymm, asymm, corefl
  - 3 vars (xyz): trans, Euc, dense
  - 4 vars (wxyz)
- by directionality
  - unidirectional, xRy ⇒ y¬Rx
  - bidirectional, "is sister of", xRy ⇒ yRx
  - invertable, "is father of" vs "is child of", xRy ⇒ ySx
  - inverse, Rʹ or R⁻¹
  - transposed, Rᵀ
