# Relation :: Relation types :: Irreflexive

Let (~) ⊆ A², xyz ∈ A

Irreflexive: `∀x. x ≁ x`


*Every* element of domain must NOT be related to itself; i.e. any pairs are allowed as long as their are not identity pairs.

A relation R is irreflexive if each element of domain is not R-related to itself.

This means the identity relation cannot be irreflexive.

Universal or full relation (entire Cartesian product) is not irreflexive.

The empty relation is the only relation that is reflexive and irreflexive at the same time (and a whole lot vacuously more).
