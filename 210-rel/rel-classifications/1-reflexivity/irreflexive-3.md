## Irreflexive relation

> A binary relation `R` on set `A` is **irreflexive** (anti-reflexive) if no element of `A` is related to itself.

A relation `R` on a set `A` is irreflexive iff `∀x(x ∈ A -> ¬xRx)`

- A relation `R` on the set `ℕ` is irreflexive if it contains no diagonal (or identity) pairs.
