# Coreflexive

Reflexive
`∀x ∈ X. xRx`

reflexive relations
- `≥`

non-reflexive relations
- `>`


Irreflexive (or strict)
for all x ∈ X, not xRx. For example, > is an irreflexive relation, but ≥ is not.

Coreflexive
for all x, y ∈ X, if xRy then x = y.[7] For example, the relation over the integers in which each odd number is related to itself is a coreflexive relation. The equality relation is the only example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation, and any coreflexive relation is a subset of the identity relation.

Left quasi-reflexive
for all x, y ∈ X, if xRy then xRx.

Right quasi-reflexive
for all x, y ∈ X, if xRy then yRy.

Quasi-reflexive
for all x, y ∈ X, if xRy then xRx and yRy. A relation is quasi-reflexive if, and only if, it is both left and right quasi-reflexive.
The previous 6 alternatives are far from being exhaustive; e.g., the red binary relation y = x2 is neither irreflexive, nor coreflexive, nor reflexive, since it contains the pair (0, 0), and (2, 4), but not (2, 2), respectively. The latter two facts also rule out (any kind of) quasi-reflexivity.
