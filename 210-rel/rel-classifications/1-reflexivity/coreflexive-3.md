# Relation :: Relation types :: Coreflexive

A relation `~` on a set `A` is **coreflexive** if 
`∀x∀y ∈ A. x ~ y ⇒ x = y`

A relation `R` on a set `A` is **coreflexive** if `R` only contains the pairs of the form `(a,a)`, where `a ∈ A`; that is, it is coreflexive only if it contains the identity pairs.





A reflexive relation forces all members, `∀a`, in `A` to participate in the set of the relation `R` as `(a,a)` pairs.

To check if a relation `R` is reflexive, you have to know both, the set `A` and the set of associations `M` (often mistaken for the actual relation).

A binary homogeneous relation is fully determined by both of this 2 components:
1. the set `A` (domain of the relation)
2. the set of associations `M` (the set of ordered pairs)

A binary homogeneous relation is a 2-tuple, `R = (A, M)`.
