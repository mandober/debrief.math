# Universal relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_relation

Some particular homogeneous relations over a set `X` (with arbitrary elements `x` and `x′`) are:

Empty relation, `E = ∅`, that is, `xEx′` holds never.

Universal relation, `𝓤 = X × X`, that is, `x𝓤x′` holds always.

Identity relation, `I = {(x, x) | x ∈ X}`, that is, `xIx′` holds iff `x = x′`.

# Relations :: Classification :: General relations :: Universal relation

**Universal relation** always exists between nonempty sets and it is the same as the Cartesian product of related sets, `U = A⨯B`.

# Relation :: Relation types :: Universal relation

Universal relation: `𝒰ᴀ = { (x, y) | ∀xy ∈ A }`

Universal relation is the Cartesian product itself.

Universal relation is
- [x] reflexive
- [ ] irreflexive
- [ ] coreflexive
- [x] symmetric
- [ ] asymmetric
- [ ] antisymmetric
- [x] transitive
- [ ] antitransitive
- [x] dense
- [x] connected
- [ ] cyclic
