# Relations :: Classification :: General relations

In classifying relations, *general relations* are the 3 relations that are almost always admittable when relating sets.

[General relations](./general-relations.md)
- [Universal relation](./universal-relation.md)
- [Identity relation](./identity-relation.md)
- [Empty relation](./empty-relation.md)

Notes
- all relations described are on set `A`, so `R ⊆ A²`
- variables (x,y,z,…), unless otherwise noted, range over set `A`
- relation is denoted by `R` or `∼`: `xRy` and `¬xRy`, or `x~y` and `x≁y`
