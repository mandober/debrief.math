# Universal relations

Some particular homogeneous relations over a set `A` (with vars `x` and `x′` ranging over X) are:
- Empty relation,     `E = ∅`,                i.e. `xEx′` holds never
- Universal relation, `U = A²`,               i.e. `xUx′` holds always
- Identity relation,  `I = {(x, x) | x ∈ A}`, i.e. `xIx′` holds iff `x = x′`
