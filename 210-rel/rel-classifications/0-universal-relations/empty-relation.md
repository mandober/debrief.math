# Empty relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_relation

Some particular homogeneous relations over a set `A` (with vars `x` and `x′` ranging over X) are:
- Empty relation,     `E = ∅`,                i.e. `xEx′` holds never
- Universal relation, `U = A²`,               i.e. `xUx′` holds always
- Identity relation,  `I = {(x, x) | x ∈ A}`, i.e. `xIx′` holds iff `x = x′`


Empty relation, sometimes also called null relation, is the only type of relation that is guaranteed to always exists, no matter how many sets and which kinds of sets are related.

The empty relation:
- `E ⊆ A⨯B`, since ∅ ⊆ A⨯B, E = ∅ is indeed a relation
- `E = ∅`
- `{ (x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B, x ≁ y }`
- `∀x∀y((x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ B) ⇒ (x, y) ∉ E)`


NOTE: If a relation is identified with its graph, then the use of definite articles (e.g. "the empty relation") is justified. But if a relation is identified as a tuple (which is more correct), then there are many empty relations depending on the choice of domain sets, so is would be more accurate to refer to them using indefinite articles (e.g. "an empty relation"). ALERT: There are two definite and two indefinite articles. NOTE 2: A binary relation has a domain (source) and codomain (targer) sets, but an n-ary relation only has domain sets, usually referred to by an indexed, e.g. the `j`-th domain set, `Aⱼ`, of a relation.

The only possible relation when relating empty sets is empty relation; when relating nonempty sets, empty relation is always possible. The fact that empty relation is possibile regardless of domain sets involved (whether they are empty or not) puts more emphasis on the importance of identifying relations accurately. *A relation that is properly identified as a tuple* has all its components explicitly specified, which makes it possible to always be able to tell relations apart. *Identifying a relation only by its graph is, in genral, insufficient*, and makes it impossible to differentiate between relations that have the same graph but different domains.

A *heterogenous binary relation is a triple*, `(A, R, B)`, where `A` is a domain, `B` is a codomain, and `R` is the graph of relation.

A *homogenous binary relation is a pair*, `(A, R)`, since the codomain need not be repeated, it is the same as the domain. (Hence the ordering in the triple).

If a relation is identified only with its graph, then the empty relation is identical to the empty set, `∅`.

If the empty relation, `E = A⨯B = ∅`, is on one end of the spectrum of all possible relations between (two) sets, then on the other end is the *universal relation*, which is identical to the Cartiesian product, `U = A⨯B`.
