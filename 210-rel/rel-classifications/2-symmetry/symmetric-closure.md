# Symmetric closure

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_closure

The **symmetric closure** of a binary relation `R` on a set `X` is the smallest symmetric relation on `X` that contains `R`.

## Definition

The symmetric closure `S` of a relation `R` on a set `X` is given by

`S = R ⋃ { (y, x) | (x, y) ∈ R }`

The symmetric closure `S` of a relation `R` 
is the union of `R` with its converse relation, `Rᵀ`

## Examples

For example, if `X` is a set of airports 
and `xRy` means "there is a direct flight from airport x to airport y", 
then the symmetric closure of `R` 
is the relation "there is a direct flight either from x to y or from y to x".

For example, if `X` is the set of humans 
and `R` is the relation "parent of", 
then the symmetric closure of `R` 
is the relation "`x` is a parent or a child of `y`".
