# Symmetric relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation

A binary relation `R` over a set `X` is **symmetric** 
if, for all elements `a` and `b` in `X`, 
whenever `a` is R-related to `b` 
then `b` is R-related to `a`, 
symbolized in FOL by    
`∀a,b ∈ X. aRb ⇔ bRa`

## Equivalences

- `R` is symmetric iff it is identical to its converse, `R = Rᵀ`

R | a  b  c
--|---------
a | 1  1  1
b | 0  1  1
c | 0  0  1


## Representations

- A graph depicting a symmetric relation has undirected edges.
- A tabular (adjacency matrix) presentation of a symmetric relation

R | a  b  c
--|---------
a | 1  1  1
b | 1  1  1
c | 1  1  1

refl + sym + trans





Symmetry, along with reflexivity and transitivity, are the three defining properties of an equivalence relation.


## Examples

An example is the symmetric relation is the equals relation (`=`) 
because if `a=b` is true, then `b=a` is also true.
