# Relations in logic

In logic, particularly in concrete systems of logic, such as in predicate logic, relations are predicates. In fact, the two terms are synonyms.

However, it is common to find that some terms are preferred to others depending on the arity.

A predicate or a relation is an entity similar to a function in that it expects a certain nuber of arguments (variables) and expresses something about them.

Unary relations (1-place predicates) are understood as *properties* because they express an attribute or a quality of the argument object itself (without relating it to other objects).

Binary relations (2-place predicates) are the most common; they embbed the most common association - that between two objects. These are preferentially called *predicates* to relations.

On the other hand, predicates of bigger arities are usually referred to as *relations*.

To cover everything, this treatment usually includes nullary relations (zero-place predicates) as well, which are understood as constants, such as the Boolean constants 'true' and 'false'.
