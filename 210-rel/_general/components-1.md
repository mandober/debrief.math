# Relation theory :: Components of relations

A relation is an association between two sets A and B that associates elements of domain set A to elements of codomain set B. Thereby, it is a set consisting of the ordered pairs of elements from both sets, such that the first component of an ordered pair always comes from domain, and the second component from codomain. More formally, a relation between sets `A` and `B` is a subset of the Cartesian product A⨯B,

`R ⊆ A ⨯ B = { (a,b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B }`

Since relations are in general directional, an individual component of a relation, i.e. the ordered pair `(x,y)` is not the same as `(y,x)`, where x ∈ A and y ∈ B. Besides in the ordered pairs, this directionality is encoded in the names of the two sets.

A **domain** set is the source set `A`, and a **codomain** is the target set `B`.


Components of relations:
- domain (source, origin, departure) set; the "left" set
- codomain (target, destination, arrival) set; the "right" set
- unordered pair
- ordered pair
- set of ordered pairs
- components of an ordered pair
- equality of ordered pairs
