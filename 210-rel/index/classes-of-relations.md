- Transitive relations
  - Equivalence relation:  trans + refl   + sym        0 7 1
  - Preorder (Quasiorder): trans + refl                0 7
  - Partial order:         trans + refl   + antisym    0 7 2
  - Strict partial order:  trans + irrefl + asym       0 8 9
  - Total preorder:        trans + 
  - Strict weak order:     trans + 
  - Total order:           trans + 
  - Strict total order:    trans + 
  - Prewellordering:       trans + 
  - Well-quasi-ordering:   trans + 
  - Well-ordering:         trans + 
  - Lattice:               trans + 
  - Join-semilattice:      trans + 
  - Meet-semilattice:      trans +
