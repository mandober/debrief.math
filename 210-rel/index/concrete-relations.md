Concrete relations
- Set-based relations
- Arithemtic relations



- EQ, equality, `=`
- NE, inequality, `≠`
- LE, less then or equal to, `≤`
- LT, less then, `<`
- GE, greater then or equal to, `≥`
- GT, greater then, `>`


- set membership relation, ∈ ∋ ∌ ∉
- set inclusion relation, ⊆ ⊂ ⊄ ⊈ ⊃ ⊇ ⊉ ⊅

- divisibility, ∣ ∤

- parallel lines ∥ ∦
- proportional ∝
- defined by ≝
- equivalence ≡
- definedness ⊏ ⊑ ⊐ ⊒ ⋣ ⋢
- ⊔ ⊓

* Operations can be presented as relations:
  - R = { (a, b)  | a = b - 1 }
  - a + b = c may be understood as the relation R(a,b,c)
    R = { (a,b,c) | a + b = c }
    R = { (a,b,c) | a + b <= c }
    R = { (a, b)  | (a = b ⋁ a = -b) ⋀ a + b < 5 }
    R = { (a, b)  | a = b + 2 ⋀ a + b < 10 }

- less then (LT), `<`
- not less then `≮`
- less then or equal to (LE), `≤`
- neither less-than nor equal to, `≰`
- LESS-THAN OVER EQUAL TO `≦`
- LESS-THAN BUT NOT EQUAL TO `≨`
- ⋜
- divides, `∣`
- does not divide, `∤`
- element of, `∈`
- not element of, `∉`
