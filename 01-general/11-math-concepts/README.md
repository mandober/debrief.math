# Basic concepts in math

- comprehension of complexity
  - complex (entity, problem, idea, concept, object)
  - analysis and synthesis
  - decomposition and composition
  - divide and conquer
  - abstraction
- generalization
- mathematical concept


complex entity (concept/object)
↓                             ↑
analysis              synthesis
↓                             ↑ comprehension
decomposition       composition
↓                             ↑ abstraction
comprehension -> abstraction -> generalization
