# Math terms


## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process in which the previously studied and well-understood details (of the studied object or concept) are going through the deliberate simplification as the process of understanding moves from the lower to higher levels, toward the totality.

In math, abstraction is the process of extracting the underlying *essence* of a *mathematical concept*, then *generalizing* it so it has wider utility.

## Phenomenon vs noumenon
In metaphysics, the **noumenon** is a posited object or event that exists independently of human sense or perception. The term noumenon is generally used in relation to the term **phenomenon**, which refers to anything that can be apprehended by, or is an object of, the senses.

## Generalization
A generalization is the formulation of general concepts from specific instances by abstracting common properties. Generalizations posit the existence of a domain or set of elements, as well as one or more common characteristics shared by those elements (thus creating a conceptual model). As such, they are the essential basis of all valid deductive inferences. The process of verification is necessary to determine whether a generalization holds true for any given situation.

## Essence vs accident
In philosophy, **essence** is the property that makes an entity what it fundamentally is, which it has by necessity, without which it loses its identity. Essence is contrasted with **accident** - a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity.
