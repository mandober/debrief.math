## Class
A class is a set of sets that can be unambiguously defined by a property all member sets have in common.

## Proper class
In von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel (NBG) set theory, proper class is an entity that is not a member of another entity.

## Independence
In mathematical logic, independence is the unprovability of a sentence from other sentences.

## Aliquot sum
An aliquot sum of an integer is the sum of its factors, excluding the integer itself.

## Magnitude
In mathematics, magnitude is the size of a mathematical object, a property which determines whether the object is larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind. More formally, an object's magnitude is the displayed result of an ordering (or ranking) of the class of objects to which it belongs.

# Mathematical notation
Mathematical notation is a system of symbolic representations of mathematical objects and ideas. Mathematical notations are used in mathematics, the physical sciences, engineering, and economics. Mathematical notations include relatively simple symbolic representations, such as the numbers 0, 1 and 2; function symbols such as sin; operator symbols such as "+"; conceptual symbols such as lim and dy/dx; equations and variables; and complex diagrammatic notations such as Penrose graphical notation and Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams.
