## Introduction

*Intuitionistic logic* encompasses the general principles of logical reasoning which have been abstracted by logicians from intuitionistic mathematics, as developed by *L. E. J. Brouwer* beginning in 1907.

Because these principles also hold for *Russian recursive mathematics* and the *constructive analysis* of E. Bishop and his followers, intuitionistic logic may be considered the logical basis of *constructive mathematics*.

Although *intuitionistic analysis* conflicts with *classical analysis*, intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic is a subsystem of classical Peano arithmetic. It follows that intuitionistic propositional logic is a proper subsystem of classical propositional logic, and pure intuitionistic predicate logic is a proper subsystem of pure classical predicate logic.

- Intuitionism vs logicism
  Intuitionism differs from *logicism* by treating logic as a part of mathematics rather than as the foundation of mathematics.
- Intuitionism vs finitism
  Intuitionism differs from from *finitism* by allowing constructive reasoning about potentially uncountable structures (e.g. monotone bar induction on the tree of potentially infinite sequences of natural numbers).
- Intuitionism vs Platonism
  Intuitionism differs from from *Platonism* by viewing mathematical objects as mental constructs with no independent ideal existence.

Intuitionism and Formalism

*Hilbert's formalist program*, to justify classical mathematics by reducing it to a formal system whose consistency should be established by *finitistic* (hence constructive) means, was the most powerful contemporary rival to Brouwer's developing intuitionism.

In his 1912 essay "Intuitionism and Formalism" Brouwer correctly predicted that any attempt to prove the consistency of complete induction on the natural numbers would lead to a vicious circle.

Brouwer rejected formalism per se, but admitted the potential usefulness of formulating general logical principles expressing intuitionistically correct constructions, such as modus ponens.

Formal systems for intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic and arithmetic were fully developed by Heyting (1930), Gentzen (1935) and Kleene (1952).

G√∂del (1933) proved the equiconsistency of intuitionistic and classical theories.

Beth (1956) and Kripke (1965) provided semantics with respect to which intuitionistic logic is correct and complete, although the completeness proofs for intuitionistic predicate logic require some classical reasoning.
