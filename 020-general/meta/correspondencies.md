# Mathematical trinitarianism :: Debrief
(debriefs are summaries by the author)

Mathematical trinitarianism `♺` is the correspondence inspired either by the Catholic dogma of holy trinity or yakuza, only here it is a relation between any of the three math areas: category theory, type theory and logic. Set theory, if at all needed, is contained mostly in type theory, so it has a ghost of presence still. Logic, on the other hand, is not really intended to be that broad and the logics applicable to trinity membership are actually only those based on the IL.

When stuck trying to figure shit out, it pays to stop and temporarily consider how would things look if you replaced some operators by others, broadly similar in shape and intent.
