# Abstract mathematics

## Mathematics as a science

Abstract mathematics is different from other sciences.

A science such as chemistry takes place mainly in laboratory where chemists perform experiments to verify theories, make new progress and discoveries.

Although mathematics is often motivated by physical experimentation or by computer simulations, it is made rigorous through the use of logical arguments.

In studying abstract mathematics, we take what is called an *axiomatic approach*; that is, we take a collection of objects `S` and we assume some rules about its structure. These rules are called *axioms*. Using the axioms for `S`, we wish to derive other information about `S` by using *logical arguments*. We require that the *axioms be consistent*; that is, they should not contradict one another. We also demand that there not be too many axioms. If a system of axioms is too restrictive, there will be few examples of the mathematical structure.

A *statement* in mathematics is an *assertion* that is either true or false. A *mathematical proof* is nothing more than a convincing argument about the accuracy of a statement. Such an argument should contain enough detail to convince the audience;
