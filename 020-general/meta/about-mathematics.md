# About mathematics

Mathematics 🧐. Oh, how sweet the sound 🤓. Privileged people 🤠 will be the first to lauch into a romantic tyrade about how pure and independent math is, how numbers never lie, how math doesn't care if you're rich or poor, black or white, man or woman 👽; no, it only cares about whether you can do the work and do it correctly… What a bunch of bollocks! 👺

Mathematics is an ancient (senior, white) boy's club. 👹 Membership requires mysogeny, racism, doublethink, doublespeak, patronizing, brown-nosing, gaslighting, enourmous hypocrisy.

Mathematicins - frequently grumpy, usually older, permanently white, infinitely righteous, and constantly men - have long ago restricted access, curb the influence, consolidating the moderation power to a select few groups. Mathematics in academia is a clan formed around a tight, inscrupulus core of intollerant geezers harder to penetrate then cosa nostra. Methods are similar so new ideas are killed with a quickness of a loathing ridicule with their authors tared'n'feathered in a blitzkrieg smear campaign. Many a set theorist have been painted as a corruptor of youth, the devil himself. 👿 The sect prevails, keeping the set of modest enthusiasts and the privileged pairwise disjoint. Your theory may cure cancer as a side-effect, but it won't be ackowedged, no, it won't be read, no - no peer review for you! 🥺 If you insist, you'll get bitch-slapped in a cross-fire hurricane by the nastiest clique of bearded teethless hags who won't hesitate to put a spike right through your head.

In conclusion: mathematics good, but mathematicians terrible. It takes far more then honest inspirational work to make it. The work does not speak for itself unless the reception was oiled up. Women are mistreated as a hobby.
