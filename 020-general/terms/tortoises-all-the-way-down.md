# Tortoises all the way down

This phrase "(something) all the way down" is now in the realm of legends as there is no account of where it appeared first, but a common telling is the following one:

A well-known scientist, some say it was Bertrand Russell, once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called the galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: "What you have told us is rubbish! The world is really a flat plate resting on the back of a giant tortoise". The scientist let a superior smile before replying, "Then what is the tortoise standing on?". "You're very clever, young man, very clever", said the old lady, "but it's tortoises all the way down!"

In the modern FP setting this is commonly paraphrased as *it's the functions all the way down*.
