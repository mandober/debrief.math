# Metamathematics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamathematics

**Metamathematics** is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods.

>This means that mathematics is its own metalanguage.

The study produces **metatheories**, which are mathematical theories about mathematical theories.

Metamathematics arose due to David Hilbert's attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics, in the early XX century.

Stephen Kleene said in 1952 that metamathematics provides "a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic".

An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system.

Informally, this means that a proposition like `"2+2=4"` is classified as belonging to mathematics, while a proposition like `"'2+2=4' is valid"` belongs to metamathematics.

In this case, mathematics is the *object language*, while metamathematics is the *meta language* used to discussed the object language.

>However, this means that mathematics is its own metalanguage. 
That is, mathematics is the object language discussed using mathematics as its metalanguage. Being its own meta language risks introducing inconsistencies and paradoxes.
