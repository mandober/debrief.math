# Classical mathematics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mathematics

In the foundations of mathematics, 
**classical mathematics** refers to 
the mainstream approach to mathematics 
based on classical logic and ZFC.

It stands in contrast to other types of mathematics 
such as constructive mathematics or predicative mathematics. 
In practice, the most common non-classical systems are used in constructive mathematics.

Classical mathematics is sometimes attacked on philosophical grounds, due to constructivist and other objections to the logic, set theory, etc., chosen as its foundations, such as have been expressed by L. E. J. Brouwer. Almost all mathematics, however, is done in the classical tradition, or in ways compatible with it.

Defenders of classical mathematics, such as David Hilbert, have argued that it is easier to work in, and is most fruitful; although they acknowledge non-classical mathematics has at times led to fruitful results that classical mathematics could not (or could not so easily) attain, they argue that on the whole, it is the other way round.
