**morphism** or **arrow** is a structure-preserving mapping between mathematical structures (objects) of the same type.

**isomorphism** is a mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. It is a bijection, a structure preserving mapping (thus it can be reveresed).

In every category of algebraic structures, an isomorphism is a homomorphism that is a bijection. An isomorphism of an algebraic structure onto itself is called an automorphism.

**homomorphism** is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type.

**automorphism** is an isomorphism from a structure to itself.
