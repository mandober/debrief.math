# Lattice

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)

A lattice is an abstract structure consisting of a **poset** in which every two elements have a unique supremum (least upper bound or **join**) and a unique infimum (greatest lower bound or **meet**). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.



A lattice is an abstract structure studied in the mathematical subdisciplines of *order theory* and *abstract algebra*.

A **lattice** consists of 
a *partially ordered set* 
in which every two elements have 
a unique **supremum** (**least upper bound**    or **join**) and 
a unique **infimum**  (**greatest lower bound** or **meet**).

An example is given by the natural numbers, 
partially ordered by divisibility, for which 
the unique supremum is the least common multiple (LCM) and 
the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor (GCD).
