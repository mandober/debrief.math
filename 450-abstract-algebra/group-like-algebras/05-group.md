# Group

**Group** is a set equipped with a binary operation, obeying the axioms of
- Totality
- Identity
- Invertibility
- Associativity


"The axioms for a group are short and natural. Yet somehow hidden behind these axioms is the *monster simple group*, a huge and extraordinary mathematical object, which appears to rely on numerous bizarre coincidences to exist. The axioms for groups give no obvious hint that anything like this exists." -- Richard Borcherds



## Abelian group

If the axiom of commutativity is also satisfied a group is an Abelian group (or commutative group).

Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers.
- Totality
- Identity
- Invertibility
- Associativity
- Commutativity
