A **divisor** or **factor** of an integer $$n$$ is an integer $$m$$ that may be multiplied by some integer $$k$$ to produce $$n$$, that is, $$n = k\cdot m$$. This implies that any $$n$$ has 1 and itself as factors, $$n=n\cdot1$$.

It can also be stated that $$n$$ is a **multiple** of $$m$$; and also of $$k$$.

An integer $$n$$ is **divisible by** another integer $$m$$ if $$m$$ is a divisor of $$n$$, which implies that dividing $$n$$ by $$m$$ leaves no remainder.
