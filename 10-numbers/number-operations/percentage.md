# Percentage

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage

- A percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100
- It is often denoted using the percent sign, `%`.
- A percentage is a dimensionless or pure number.
- 45% (read "forty-five percent") = 45/100 = 45:100 = 0.45
- Percentages are often used to express a proportionate part of a total.
- the term "percent" is derived from the Latin *per centum* "by the hundred"
- the percent symbol evolved by gradual contraction of the Italian *per cento* "for a hundred". "per" was often abbreviated as "p." and eventually disappeared; "cento" was contracted to two circles separated by a horizontal line, which evolved into the modern symbol.
