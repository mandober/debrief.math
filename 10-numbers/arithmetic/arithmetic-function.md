# Arithmetic function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_function

In number theory, an **arithmetic function** or **number-theoretic function** is (for most authors) any function $$f(n)$$ whose domain is the positive integers and whose range is a subset of the complex numbers.

Hardy & Wright include in their definition the requirement that an arithmetical function "expresses some arithmetical property of n".

An example of an arithmetic function is the *divisor function* whose value at a positive integer n is equal to the number of divisors of n.

There is a larger class of number-theoretic functions that do not fit the above definition, e.g. *the prime-counting functions*. This article provides links to functions of both classes.

Many of the functions mentioned in this article have expansions as series involving these sums; see the article Ramanujan's sum for examples.
