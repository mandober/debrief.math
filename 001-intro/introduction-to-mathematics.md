# Introduction to mathematics

Mathematics is not only about getting familiar with the established mathematical facts, in form of the identities and laws, as much as it is about asking questions, especially about the established facts. That's why it is hard to find a mathematical topic that just lays down the cold facts without raising additional questions while doing it.

For example, algebraic structures seem to obey hierarchy of properties, with magma starting with the axiom of totality, then semigroup adding the associativity axiom, then monoid adding the identity axiom, then group adding the commutativity axiom, which might seem suitable for categorization. But then we see that it is not about progressive addition of axioms, but rather about examining every permutation of axioms and properties.
