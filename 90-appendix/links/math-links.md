## All things number bases
[numberbases.com](http://www.numberbases.com/)    
This website aims to explore integer number bases in terms of their elementary relationships with their digits, assessing these as facilitators of human arithmetic. The analyses employ digit maps, which serve as simple visual tools that synopsize these relationships.

## Apronus: math
[apronus.com](https://www.apronus.com/math/math.htm)
Geometry, Triangles, The Proof of Pythagoras' Theorem, Divisibility by Three Explained, real numbers, etc.

## Proven math
[apronus.com/provenmath](https://www.apronus.com/provenmath/)    
Everything proven from axioms. Mathematical project which states the foundations of mathematics and derives mathematical knowledge from these foundations. Every theorem on Provenmath is proved within the pages of Provenmath and can be traced down to the foundations. The content of Provenmath is self-contained. If you have found a theorem which interests you then you can be certain that you can also find a complete proof of this theorem. 

## Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem
[apronus.com/math/goedel](https://www.apronus.com/math/goedel.htm)    
An Outline of the Proof of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem. We construct a statement in set theory such that it is not a theorem and its negation is not a theorem. What we show on this page is not a presentation of the proof that was written by Gödel himself. We present all the basic ideas that are necessary to understand what the theorem asserts and what it would take to write a proof.
