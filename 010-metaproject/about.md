# Project Meta :: About

A bunch of notes about math.

Mostly about computer-related mathematical subjects, so primarily concerning discrete mathematics.

This directory, `math.debrief`, is a part of the overarching "project" `debris` that houses the notes about subject matters split into two tiers, theory and praxis.

The theory tier includes notes and reference primarily about mathematics and computer science, and, to a lesser extent, about linguistics and philosophy.

The praxis tier collects misc notes about the actual items and products (as practical implementations of their respecive underlying theories), like programming `lang`uages (Haskell, Agda, Rust, Lean, Idris, bash, JS), desktop and console `app`s, `shell` (general and conrete aspects of shells and terminals, operating systems, toolchains, subsystems, etc.), and `tech`nology (web technology, web design, UIs, UX, typography, unicode, latex, javascript ecosystem, virtualization, etc.).

In brief, this is a collection of notes, about various but all computer-related subjects, that occasionally overkills the intended summarizing approach.
