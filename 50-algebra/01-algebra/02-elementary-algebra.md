# Elementary algebra

Elementary algebra is the more basic part of algebra. Elementary algebra is an abstraction of arithmetic in that concrete values (numbers) are replaced with variables. Instead of focusing on the immediate result, the introduction of variables shifts focus on the general laws that govern the manipulation of symbols in the equations. These variables usually range over numbers and the prime operations are addition and multiplication.

Unlike abstract algebra, elementary algebra is not concerned with algebraic structures outside the realm of real and complex numbers.
