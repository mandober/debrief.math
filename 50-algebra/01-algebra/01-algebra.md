# Algebra


**Algebra** studies mathematical symbols and the laws governing manipulation of the symbols. Algebra is used, or a specific kind of algebra forms a part, of many mathematical branches, since it is concerned with many reoccurring themes, from equation solving to the higher mathematical abstractions.

**Elementary algebra** is similar to Arithmetic, but it replaces concrete numbers with variables ranging over numbers in order to focus on the laws governing the manipulation of symbols in equations, rather then their immediate result.

**Abstract algebra**, the advance part of algebra, studies abstractions of mathematical objects into *algebraic structures*, such as a monoid, group, ring, field, etc.


## The term "algebra"

In math, the word "algebra" has several related meanings:
* Without an article, 
  "algebra", 
  it denotes a part of math
* With an article, 
  "an algebra", 
  or in the plural form, 
  "algebras", 
  it denotes a specific mathematical structure
* With a qualifier (adjective), 
  it denotes a part of algebra, 
  such as "elementary algebra" or "abstract algebra"
* With an article and a qualifier 
  it denotes an instance of some abstract structure: 
  "a Lie algebra", "an associative algebra", "a vertex operator algebra"
* a qualifier sometimes carries both meanings: 
  "Commutative algebra is the study of commutative rings, which are commutative algebras over the integers"
