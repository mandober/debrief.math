**Boolean algebra**, introduced by George Boole in 1847, is a branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values, `True` and `False`.

**Linear algebra** is concerned with linear equations such as linear functions and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.

**Algebraic topology** uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to a homeomorphism, although usually most classify up to a homotopy equivalence.

**Universal algebra** (sometimes called *general algebra*) studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples/models of algebraic structures. For instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes the class of groups as a single object of study. Universal algebra is the formalization of the general theory of algebraic structures. Different classes of non/algebraic objects, and relations between them, are studied in terms of the category theory.
