# Lattice

A lattice is an abstract structure consisting of a **poset** in which every two elements have a unique supremum (least upper bound or **join**) and a unique infimum (greatest lower bound or **meet**). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.
