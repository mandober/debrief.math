# Groups

## Definition of a group

A group consists of a set of elements and a binary operation and it obeys the group axioms.

A group is not a set but a tuple `(S, ⋆)`, where `S` is a set of elements and `⋆` is a binary operation. A qualify as a group it must obey the group axioms.


## Group axioms

If a group is denoted as $$G$$ and the binary operation as $$\star$$ (called the *group law* of $$G$$) then:

1. **Closure**     
  $$\forall a,b . (a,b \in G) \to a \star b \in G$$    
  If `a` and `b` are elements of the group `G`, then the result of the binary operation, `a ⋆ b`, is an element that is also in `G`.

To qualify as a group, the set and operation, (G, ⋆), must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms.


2. **Associativity**    
For all a, b and c in G, (a ⋆ b) ⋆ c = a ⋆ (b ⋆⋆ c)

3. **Identity**    
Identity element
There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, the equation e ⋆ a = a ⋆ e = a holds. Such an element is unique (see below), and thus one speaks of the identity element.

4. **Invertibility**    
Inverse element
For each a in G, there exists an element b in G, commonly denoted a−1 (or −a, if the operation is denoted "+"), such that a ⋆ b = b ⋆ a = e, where e is the identity element.


group = (G, ⋆), G = {id,x,x',...}

- set of elements together with a binary operation, `*` ("star")
- Closure: the set is closed under the operation `*`
- Associativity: the `*` operation is associative
- Identity: there is the identity element
- Invertibility: the "undo" element
