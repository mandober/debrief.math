# Involution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)


*Involutory function* is a function that is its own inverse.

An *involution*, or an *involutory function*, is a function $$f$$ that is its own inverse, $$f(f(x)) = x$$

for all $$x$$ in the domain of $$f$$

Equivalently, applying $$f$$ twice produces the original value.

The term **anti-involution** refers to involutions based on *antihomomorphisms* (see Quaternion algebra, groups, semigroups)

$$f(xy) = f(y) f(x)$$ such that

$$xy = f(f(xy)) = f( f(y) f(x) ) = f(f(x)) f(f(y)) = xy$$
