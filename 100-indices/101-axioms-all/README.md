# Axioms in mathematics

This is a description of all distinct axioms reoccuring in mathematics. Some axioms are tied only to a single particular subject or situation, and some are more general. Out of the more general ones, the set of *the most common axioms* consists of the very familiar axioms that occur in many different mathematical areas.

## The Most Common Axioms (MCA)

1. Identity

The first place goes to identity. Almost everybody's got one, except semis.

2. Associativity

The second place goes to associativity. Hardly a surprse, since this guy has appeared in blockbusters such as "pretty much everyhing that has got to do with numbers", "operators, actually", "operation: binary", to name just a few.
