## Definition

A category $$C$$ is given by a collection $$C_0$$ of objects and a collection $$C_1$$ of arrows which have the following structure:

Each arrow has a domain and a codomain which are objects; one writes

$$f: X \to Y or X \map f Y$$

if $$X$$ is the domain of the arrow $$f$$, and $$Y$$ its codomain.

One also writes 

$$X = dom(f) and Y = cod(f)$$
