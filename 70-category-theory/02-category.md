# Category

A category is a generalization of sets and functions. Sets are abstracted into objects (just a neutral term with little semantic baggage), and functions into arrows (morphisms).

The standard example of a category is the category of sets and functions, $$\textbf{Set}$$.

> Every category is defined by its objects and morphisms, but there is a way to characterize a category, a way that doesn't depend on objects and morphisms, yet which reveals its structure.

To analyse an object, we can't explore it directly, but indirectly through its relations with other objects. These relations are represented by arrows. To examine an object in search for structure, we can map an object into another. Using the structure-preserving mappings, we can classify categories while probing their properties in search for similarities.


Category theory is about composing arrows. But not any two arrows can be composed. The target object of one arrow must be the same as the source source object of the next arrow.
