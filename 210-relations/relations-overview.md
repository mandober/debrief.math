# Relations: Overview


## Relations on sets


### Ordered pair


### Cartesian product
A Cartesian product is a mathematical operation on sets that returns a new set, called the product set (or simply product).

That is, for sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a ∈ A and b ∈ B.

Products can be specified using set-builder notation:

{\displaystyle A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.}A\times B=\{\,(a,b)\mid a\in A\ {\mbox{ and }}\ b\in B\,\}.
