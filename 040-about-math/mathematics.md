# Mathematics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics

Mathematics studies the *quantity* (number theory), *structure* (algebra), *space* (geometry) and *change* (mathematical analysis).

The word "mathematics" has Greek origins `μάθημα` "máthēma" knowledge, study, learning.



Mathematicians seek and use patterns to formulate new *conjectures*; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by *mathematical proof*.

When *mathematical structures* are good models of real phenomena, then *mathematical reasoning* can provide insight or predictions about nature.

Through the use of *abstraction* and *logic*, mathematics developed from *counting*, *calculation*, *measurement*, and the systematic study of the *shapes* and *motions* of physical objects.

*Practical mathematics* has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist.

The research required to solve *mathematical problems* can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

*Rigorous arguments* first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in *Euclid's Elements*.

Since the pioneering work of *Giuseppe Peano* (1858–1932), *David Hilbert* (1862–1943), and others on *axiomatic systems* in the late 19th century, it has become customary to view *mathematical research* as establishing truth by *rigorous deduction* from appropriately chosen *axioms* and *definitions*.

Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.

Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the social sciences.

*Applied mathematics* has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as *statistics* and *game theory*. Mathematicians engage in *pure mathematics* without having any application in mind, but practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of real world problems, before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as *abstract structures*.

For example, geometry has its origins in the calculation of distances and areas in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in arithmetic.
