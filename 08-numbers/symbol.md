# Symbol

A symbol is a marker (sign, pointer, cue) representing something else, apart from itself. Symbols are used to convey meaning.

Symbol is a    
marker/sign/pointer/cue   
in the form of   
word/image/gesture/sound   
that   
indicates/signifies/placeholds/represents    
concept/object/entity/anything/really   
apart from itself.

Symbols usually dwell in the visual and auditory domain expressed as words, images, gestures, sounds, or some other form; they may take any form or the form of anything they encounter and in that regard they are a lot like polymimetic alloys. If it is hard to tell apart an actual thing from its (possible and plausible) symbol, then fugazi. Communication, human or otherwise, possibly even the process of thinking, is achieved through the use of symbols.

Numerals are symbols for numbers. Alphabetic letters may be symbols for sounds.
Personal names are symbols representing individuals. The variable $$x$$ may symbolize promiscuity. A red rose fails to symbolize a vague, generally not agreed upon, concept.

The word symbol derives from the Greek `σύμβολον` meaning "token, watchword"; from `σύν` (together) and `βάλλω` (put, throw).
