# Well Ordering Principle

**Definition (WOP):**    
> Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest element.

This statement is known as The Well Ordering Principle (WOP).

it requires a nonempty set
it's false for the empty set 
which has no smallest element 
because it has no elements at all.

And it requires a set of nonnegative integers
it's false for the set of negative integers 
and also false for some sets of nonnegative rationals,
e.g. the set of positive rationals.

The Well Ordering Principle captures
something special about the nonnegative integers.

Well Ordering Principle provides one of the most important proof rules in discrete mathematics.
