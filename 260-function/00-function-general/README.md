# Function

This section is called *Function*, but it may as well be called *Function Theory* to align it with near math fields of Set Theory and Relation Theory.

## Function Theory

This section deals with functions: notion of function, history of functions, interpretations of functions, applications of functions, function anatomy and releted concepts, function notation, function operations (that is, operations performed on function).

Functions are ubiquituous throughout mathematics, and many math fields have their own take on the functions. Here, we are trying to collect and explain the relevant concepts, from basic to advanced, leaving the overview of the highly specialized uses of functions to their originating fields.
