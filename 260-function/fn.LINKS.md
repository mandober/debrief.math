* Simple Laws about Nonprominent Properties of Binary Relations
Jochen Burghardt, 2020
https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02948115/document
We checked each binary relation on a 5-element set for a given set of properties, including usual ones like asymmetry and less known ones like Euclideanness. Using a poor man's Quine-McCluskey algorithm, we computed prime implicants of non-occurring property combinations, like "not irreflexive, but asymmetric". We considered the laws obtained this way, and manually proved them true for binary relations on arbitrary sets, thus contributing to the encyclopedic knowledge about less known properties.
