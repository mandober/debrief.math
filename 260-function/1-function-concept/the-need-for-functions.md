# The need for functions

Functions provide means of
- abstraction (new, independent unit of content)
- creating new information units
- independence, independent packaging
- packaging information
- parameterization
- alternative means of representation
- reusability, non-repeatability, convenient reuse
- increase in maintanence
- easier refactoring
- bottling actions
- preserving actions
- saving complex manipulations
- have visual presentation (graphs)



Until the 19. century, functions were thought of as being definable only by formulas, including the formulas for infinite series. This view could be referred to as *function-as-formula*. Under this view, a function abstracts an expression, allowing for parameterization and reusability.

For example, expressions 1², 2², 3², 4², 5², etc., express the squares of the natural numbers. These expressions are failry simple, but if we put the integer through more operations, e.g. `(3²+1)/(3³-1)`

are much more easily managed (if nothing else) if they are represented by a parameterized formula, in which, rather then hardcoding the main constant of interest, we represent it by a variable instead.

use a variable to parameterize the constant, i.e. to parameterize the input
