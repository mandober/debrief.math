# Function space

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space

A **function space** is a set of functions between two fixed sets.

Often, the domain and/or codomain will have additional structure which is inherited by the function space. For example, the set of functions from any set into a vector space has a natural vector space structure given by pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. In other scenarios, the function space might inherit a topological or metric structure, hence the name function space.

Function spaces appear in various areas of mathematics:

* In set theory, the set of functions from `X` to `Y`, denoted `X → Y` or `Y^X`

* As a special case, the powerset of a set X, `𝓟(X)`, may be identified with the set of all functions from `X` to `𝔹 = {0,1}`, denoted `2^X`. That is, the cardinality of the powerset of `X` is the same as the number of different functions from `X` to `𝔹` (the Boolean set), `X -> 𝔹`.   
If `n = |X|`, then `|𝓟(X)|` = `2ⁿ` = `|X -> 𝔹|` = `𝔹ⁿ`

* The set of bijections `X -> Y` is denoted `X ↔ Y`. The factorial notation `X!` may be used for permutations of a single set `X`.

* In functional analysis, the same is seen for continuous linear transformations, including topologies on the vector spaces in the above, and many of the major examples are function spaces carrying a topology; the best known examples include Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.

* In functional analysis, the set of all functions `ℕ -> X` is called a *sequence space*. It consists of the set of all possible sequences of elements of `X`.

* In topology, one may attempt to put a topology on the space of continuous functions from a topological space `X` to another one `Y`, with utility depending on the nature of the spaces. A commonly used example is the compact-open topology, e.g. loop space. Also available is the product topology on the space of set theoretic functions (i.e. not necessarily continuous functions) `YX`. In this context, this topology is also referred to as the topology of pointwise convergence.

* In algebraic topology, the study of homotopy theory is essentially that of discrete invariants of function spaces.

* In the theory of stochastic processes, the basic technical problem is how to construct a probability measure on a function space of paths of the process (functions of time).

* In category theory, the function space is called an *exponential object* (or map object). It appears in one way as the representation canonical bifunctor; but as (single) functor, of type `[X, -]`, it appears as an adjoint functor to a functor of type `(-×X)` on objects.

* In functional programming and lambda calculus, function types are used to express the idea of higher-order functions.

* In domain theory, the basic idea is to find constructions from partial orders that can model lambda calculus, by creating a well-behaved cartesian closed category.

* In the representation theory of finite groups, given two finite-dimensional representations `V` and `W` of a group `G`, one can form a representation of `G` over the vector space of linear maps `Hom(V,W)` called the *Hom representation*.
