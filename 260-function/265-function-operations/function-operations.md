Since relations are sets, they can be manipulated using set operations 
(union, intersection, complementation, etc.) 
and satisfying the laws of an algebra of sets.

Beyond that, operations like the converse of a relation and the composition of relations are available, satisfying the laws of a calculus of relations.

A deeper analysis of relations involves decomposing them into subsets called *concepts*, and placing them in a *complete lattice*.

Since all functions are relations, but also sets, this goes for functions too.
