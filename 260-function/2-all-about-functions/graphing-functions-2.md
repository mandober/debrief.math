## Graphing functions

It is sometimes difficult to understand the behavior of a function given only its definition; a visual representation or its graph can be very helpful.

>A **graph** is a set of points (coordinates) in the *Cartesian plane*, where each point `(x, y)` indicates that `f(x) = y`.

    (x, y) = (x, f(x))

In other words, a graph uses the position of a point in one direction (y-axis) to indicate the value of `f` for a position of the point in the other direction (x-axis).

Functions may be graphed by finding the value of `f` (outputs `y`) for various inputs `x`, then plotting these ordered pairs as points `(x, f(x))` in a Cartesian plane.

For many functions, the parts of the function between the determined points can generally be approximated by connecting the plotted points with a line, thereby getting a curve that represents the function.

Functions may also be extended beyond the set of the determined points by extrapolating additional points, which usually gets increasingly inaccurate.

## Rational functions

Rational function is any function which can be defined by a rational fraction, i.e. an algebraic fraction such that both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials.
