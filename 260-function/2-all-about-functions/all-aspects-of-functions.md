# All aspects of functions

For such a relatively simple concept there is a whole lotta things about functions. Many aspects that need to be disambiguated, better described or specified, or made more precise or strict. For a big one right off the bat: there is no total agrement about what even defines a function. This issue is involved with the significance of *function type* pushing against the priority of *function definition* (to be discussed later).
