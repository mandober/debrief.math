# History of the function concept

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept

Functions were not explicitly considered in antiquity, but some precursors of the concept can perhaps be seen in the work of medieval philosophers and mathematicians such as Oresme.

The mathematical concept of a function emerged in the XVII century in connection with the development of the calculus. For example, the slope `dy/dx` of a graph at a point was regarded as a function of the x-coordinate of the point.

Mathematicians of the XVIII century typically regarded functions as defined by analytic expressions.

In the XIX century, the demands of the rigorous development of analysis by Weierstrass et al, the reformulation of geometry in terms of analysis, and the invention of set theory by Cantor, eventually led to the much more general, modern, concept of the function as a single-valued map that maps one set to another.
