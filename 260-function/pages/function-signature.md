# Function signature

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_signature

Haskell is the pinnacle of an effort to develop a programming language driven by a serious academic effort and their desire to integrate all the long-standing knowledge, along with the recent discoveries, primarily in the PLT (programming language theory) but also in the related fields such as theoretical CS, mathematics, logic, type theory, category theory, etc. In fewer words, Haskell inherits the academic support and the syntaxtical influence from the respected languages that came before, meaning that we might as well just consult Haskell's approach to typing, knowing that it was done right.

In computer science, a **type signature** usually refers to a user-specified, standalone, type expression that describes a function's type, while **type annotations** usually mean user-specified types that are inlined into expressions so as to refer to only some part of it.

In a statically-typed PLs, long before the compilation starts, all the language entities must already be assigned the correct type, whether by the programmer (and verified by the type-checker) or automatically inferred by the type-checker.
