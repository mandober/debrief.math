# Limit of a sequence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence

A **limit** is the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value.

A **limit of a sequence** is the value that the terms of a sequence approach to ("tend to"). It is denoted by:

`lim {n → ∞} aₙ`

If such a limit exists, a sequence is *convergent*, otherwise *divergent*.

The limit of a sequence is said to be the fundamental notion on which the whole of mathematical analysis ultimately rests. Limits can be defined in any metric or topological space, but are usually first encountered in the real numbers.

The concept of a limit of a sequence is further generalized to the concept of a limit of a topological net, and is closely related to limit and direct limit in category theory.

## Exmaples

* Ex.1

The sequence given by the perimeters of regular `n`-sided polygons that circumscribe the unit circle has a limit equal to the perimeter of the circle (2\πr). The corresponding sequence for inscribed polygons has the same limit. Staring with a triangle at n = 3, we get a square at n = 4, then a pentagon at n = 5, a hexagon (n = 6), and so on.... As `n` tends to infinity, `n → ∞`, i.e. as the number of sides keeps on increasing, the sequnce of the perimeters of n-sided polygons approaches the limit equal to the perimeter of the unit circle.

* Ex.2

As the positive integer `n` increases, the value `n * sin (1 / n)` becomes ever so closer to 1. Thus, it is said that the limit of the sequence `n * sin (1/n)` is 1.
