# Boolean function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function

A **Boolean function** is a function whose arguments and result range over the values of a two-element Boolean set, and typed as `f : 𝔹ⁿ → 𝔹`.

A Boolean set is often called a Boolean domain, and the indefinite article "a" suggest that many Boolean sets exists. Unlike the empty set, Boolean sets are not unique, because there are many choices for the two elements, with popular choices being `𝔹 = {0,1}` and `𝔹 = {⟘,⟙}`. However, all 2-element sets are isomorphic to each other, which is a weaker, but in this case, a more practical form of equality. In logic, Boolean function are called truth or logical functions, and the two elements in the set are interpreted as the truth values.

>A Boolean function has a Boolean domain as both its domain and codomain.

Boolean functions are the subject of study of Boolean algebra and switching theory.
