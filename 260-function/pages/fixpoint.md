# Fixpoint

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixpoint

A **fixed point** (or invariant point) is a property of endofunctions when an element of the domain is mapped to itself by the function:

If `f : A -> A`, then `x₀` is a fixpoint of `f` if `x₀ ∈ A` and `f(x₀) = x₀`.

The term "point" refers to a domain's elements even when they're not numeric values; when they are, an element and its mapping by the function form a coordinate point as the ordered pair `(x, f(x))`.

Graphically, fixpoints of a function `f(x) = y` are any points that lie on the `y = x` (1-3 quadrant) diagonal, i.e. points with the coordinates `(x, f(x))`.

Some functions don't have fixed points (e.g. constant function), some have infinitely many (e.g. identity function).

Points that come back to the same value after a finite number of iterations of the function are called *periodic points*: a fixed point is a periodic point with period equal to one.

In projective geometry, a fixed point of a projectivity has been called a double point. In Galois theory, the set of the fixed points of a set of field automorphisms is a field called the fixed field of the set of automorphisms.

## Attracting fixed points

An **attracting fixpoint** of a function `f` is a fixed point `x₀` such that for any value of `x` in the domain (that is close enough to `x₀`), the iterated function sequence `x, f x, f (f x), f (f (f x)), …` converges to `x₀`. The proof of the existence of such a solution is given by the *Banach fixed-point theorem*.

The natural cosine function ("natural" means in radians) has exactly one fixed point, which is attracting, and it works for any point (not just those that are close enough). In radians mode, start with any number and repeatedly apply `cos` and, eventually, it will converge to the *Dottie number* (~ 0.739085133), which is `cos`'s fixpoint. It is where the graph of the cosine function intersects the diagonal `y = x`.

Not all fixed points are attracting. For example, `x = 0` is a fixed point of the function `f(x) = 2x`, but iteration of this function for any value other than `0` diverges. Attracting fixed points are a special case of a wider mathematical concept of attractors. An attracting fixed point is said to be a stable fixed point if it is also Lyapunov stable. A fixpoint is said to be a neutrally stable fixpoint if it is Lyapunov stable but not attracting. Multiple attracting points can be collected in an attracting fixed set.

## Applications

In many fields, equilibria or stability are fundamental concepts that can be described in terms of fixed points.

* Compilers use fixpoint computations for program analysis; e.g. in data-flow analysis, which is often required for code optimization. They are also the core concept used by the generic program analysis method abstract interpretation.

* In type theory, the fixed-point combinator allows definition of recursive functions in the untyped lambda calculus.

* Logician Saul Kripke makes use of fixed points in his influential theory of truth. He shows how one can generate a partially defined truth predicate (one that remains undefined for problematic sentences like "This sentence is not true"), by recursively defining "truth" starting from the segment of a language that contains no occurrences of the word, and continuing until the process ceases to yield any newly well-defined sentences. (This takes a countable infinity of steps.) That is, for a language L, let L′ (read "L-prime") be the language generated by adding to L, for each sentence S in L, the sentence "S is true." A fixed point is reached when L′ is L; at this point sentences like "This sentence is not true" remain undefined, so, according to Kripke, the theory is suitable for a natural language that contains its own truth predicate.

* The vector of PageRank values of all web pages is the fixed point of a linear transformation derived from the World Wide Web's link structure.

* The stationary distribution of a Markov chain is the fixed point of the one step transition probability function.

* In physics, in the theory of phase transitions, linearisation near an unstable fixed point has led to Wilson's Nobel prize-winning work inventing the renormalization group, and to the mathematical explanation of the term "critical phenomenon."

* In economics, a *Nash equilibrium* of a game is a fixed point of the game's best response correspondence. John Nash exploited the *Kakutani fixed-point theorem* for his seminal paper that won him the Nobel prize in economics.

## Generalization to partial orders

Generalization to partial orders: prefixpoint and postfixpoint

The notion and terminology is generalized to a partial order. 

Let `≤` be a partial order over a set `X` and let `f : X → X` be a function over `X`. 

Then a *prefixpoint* of `f` is any `p` such that `p ≤ f(p)`. 

Analogously, a *postfixpoint* of `f` is any `p` such that `f(p) ≤ p`.

One way to express the *Knaster-Tarski theorem* is to say that a monotone function on a complete lattice has a least fixpoint that coincides with its least postfixpoint (and similarly its greatest fixpoint coincides with its greatest prefixpoint). Prefixpoints and postfixpoints have applications in theoretical computer science.

## Brouwer's fixpoint theorem
Brouwer's fixpoint theorem says that any continuous function from a closed ball into itself in Euclidean space must have a fixpoint.

## Knaster-Tarski theorem
The Knaster-Tarski theorem says that any order-preserving function on a complete lattice has a complete lattice of fixpoints.
