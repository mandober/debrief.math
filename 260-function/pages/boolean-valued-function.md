# Boolean-valued function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean-valued_function

A **Boolean-valued function** is a function from any type to Boolean, `f : A → 𝔹`. Its domain is the Boolean domain, `𝔹`, a generic two-element set, whose elements are interpreted as truth or logical values; usually `𝔹 = {0, 1}` or `𝔹 = {⟘, ⟙}`.

A Boolean-valued function is also called a *characteristic function*, *indicator function*, *predicate*, or *proposition*.

In all of these uses, it is understood that the various terms refer to a mathematical object and not the corresponding semiotic sign or syntactic expression.

In formal semantic theories of truth, a *truth predicate* is a predicate on the sentences of a formal language, interpreted for logic, that formalizes the intuitive concept that is normally expressed by saying that a sentence is true. A truth predicate may have additional domains beyond the formal language domain, if that is what is required to determine a final truth value.
