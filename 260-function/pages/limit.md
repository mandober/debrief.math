# Limit

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)

This article is about the general notion of limit in calculus - for more specific cases, see [Limit of a sequence](./limit-of-sequence.md) and [Limit of a function](./limit-of-function.md).


A **limit** is the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value.

Limits are essential to calculus and mathematical analysis, and are used to define continuity, derivatives and integrals.

The concept of a limit of a sequence is further generalized to the concept of a limit of a topological net, and is closely related to limit and direct limit in category theory.
