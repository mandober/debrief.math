The image of a function is the set of all output values it may produce.

More generally, 
evaluating a given function `f` 
at each element of a given subset `A` of its domain 
produces a set, called the "image of `A` under (or through) `f`".

Similarly, 
the inverse image (or preimage) 
of a given subset `B` of the codomain of `f`, 
is the set of all elements of the domain 
that map to the members of `B`.

Image and inverse image may also be defined for relations, not just functions.
