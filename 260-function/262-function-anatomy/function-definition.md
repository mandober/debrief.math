# The definition of a function

Any relation is just a collection of the associations between sets. That is, a binary relation is a set of associations that the elements of a source set (domain set) have with the elements of a destination set (codomain set). Relations do not restrict the number of associations the same domain element has with the codomain elements. The same domain element may be associated with any number of codomain elements, be it one or more or even zero.

This property is exactly the one that sets apart functions from relations. Functions are relations that resrict precisly this property, permitting a domain element to be associated to exactly one codomain element.

(definition) A function is a relation from a domain set `A` to a codomain set `B` where each domain element corresponds to exactly one codomain element.

This may be symbolically expressed as

`f(x₁) = f(x₂) -> x₁ = x₂`

This logical expression shows that if any two domain elements (represented by `x₁` and `x₂`), fed as input to a function, produce the same output (such that `f(x₁) = f(x₂)`), then they necessarily must denote the same value (`x₁ = x₂`); otherwise, `f` is not a function but a relation.

The notation for functions in general is `f(x) = y`, where `f` is a genric name of some function that takes input `x` and produces output `y`.
