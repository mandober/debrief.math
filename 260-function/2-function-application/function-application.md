# Function application

Function application is the act of applying a function to a value, which in this context is called an argument. Alternatively and equivalently, we may say that a function is called on an argument; or, that we are passing an argument into the function.

There are several notation for denoting function application.

f(x) = 4x² + 2x - 4
f(3) = 4(3)² + 2(3) - 4
