# Function Theory

Note that this section, `math/function`, is about *function theory* (or theory of functions) deals with the basic notion of mathematical function. The attempt is made to delimit this vast subject and only tackle the mathematical aspects here, leaving more complicated aspects (lambda calculi, functions in PLs, arrows as a generalization of functions in CT) in those respective sections.

It would be an excellent display of will if one could be talked into extracting all the notions relevant to fucntions from the different math and cs sections and gather them (as a copy, leaving the original articles in place) into one grand ellusive théorie fonctionnelleque.

a grand unifying theory of functions that covers all those diverse aspects of functions across all the math areas (including CS and TPL)

of function restricted to math. But in order to prevent too much fragmentation of this topic across diverse math and CS sections/fields, it might have biten too much.

The topics pertaining to the mathematical functions are definitely here. Some additional topics about functions are located in `math/set` (set-theory; although articles petaining to functions on sets were largely relocated here), `math/ct` (category-theory; arrows as a generalization of functions), `math/lc` (lambda-calculus; formalism of pure functions), `math/toc` (theory-of-computation; functions as computation), `cs/plt/functions` (programming-language-theory; for functions in PLs).
