# Functions :: Concept of function

Starting in the 1660s, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed the *infinitesimal calculus*, which essentially consists of studying how an infinitesimal (very small) variation of a variable quantity induces a corresponding variation of another quantity which is a function of the first variable. That is, how does a change in the input `x` induces a change in the output `y`.

Almost a century later, Euler fixed the terminology of infinitesimal calculus, and introduced the notation `y = f(x)` for a function `f`, its variable `x` and its value `y`.

Until the end of the 19th century, the word "variable" referred almost exclusively to the arguments and the values of functions.
