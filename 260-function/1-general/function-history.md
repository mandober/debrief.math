# Function :: Brief history of function

https://abstractmath.org/MM/MMFuncSpec.htm

Until the 19. century, functions were thought of as defined by *formulas*, including infinite series. Problems which arose in the theory of harmonic analysis made mathematicians realize that a more general notion of function is required. This was right at the time set theory was introduced, so the concept of *function as a set of ordered pairs* arose, along with functional property, which turned out to be the crucial property of functions; with relations, this property was known as *right-uniqueness*. It is said that this understanding revolutionized our understanding of mathematics. In particular, identifying a function with a set of ordered pairs, along with the increased use of set theory in general, pushed abstract mathematics to become a common tool for understanding mathematics and proving theorems.

The modern definition of function which builds on the ordered pairs and functional property came into the general common use relatively late in the history of development of mathematics, in 1950's. The modern definition of functions became necessary in algebraic topology and is used today across all math fields.

The concept of *function as a formula* never disappeared entirely, remaining an object of interest in logic where it was generalized into the concept of *function as an algorithm*. The study of algorithms is one of the central topics of computing science, so the notion of function-as-formula, or the updated function-as-algorithm, saw renowed importance.
