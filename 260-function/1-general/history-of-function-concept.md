## History of the function concept

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept

* Functions were not explicitly considered in `antiquity`, but some precursors of the concept can perhaps be seen in the work of medieval philosophers and mathematicians such as Oresme.

* The mathematical concept of a function dates back to the `17th century` when it wad associated with the development of *calculus*. For example, the slope of a graph at a point (dy/dx) was regarded as a function of the x-coordinate of the point.

* Mathematicians of the `18th century` typically regarded functions as defined by analytic expressions.

* In the `19th century`, the demands of the rigorous development of *analysis* by Weierstrass et al, the reformulation of geometry in terms of analysis, and the invention of set theory by Cantor, eventually led to the much more general, modern concept of *function as a single-valued map* that maps one set to another (function as a relation, function as a set, function as a map).

## Functions before the 17th century

### 12th century

In the 12th century, mathematician Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi analyzed the equation `x³ + d = bx²` by rewritting it to the form `x²(b - x) = d`, stating that the left hand side must be at least equal to the value of `d` for the equation to have a solution. He then determined the maximum value of this expression. The isolation of `d` on one side could be argued to be an early approach to the notion of function. A value less than `d` means no positive solution; a value equal to `d` means one solution, while a value greater than `d` means two solutions. Sharaf al-Din's analysis of this equation was a notable development in Islamic mathematics, but his work was not pursued any further at that time, neither in the Muslim world nor in Europe.

### 17th century

According to Dieudonné and Ponte, the concept of a function emerged in the 17th century as a result of the development of analytic geometry and the infinitesimal calculus. Nevertheless, Medvedev suggests that the *implicit concept of function* is one with an ancient lineage.

Ponte also remarks on explicit approaches in the Middle Ages. Historically, some mathematicians can be regarded as having foreseen and come close to a modern formulation of the concept of function. Among them is Oresme (1323-1382) who presents some general ideas about independent and dependent variables in his theory.

The development of analytical geometry around 1640 allowed mathematicians to translate geometric problems about curves into algebraic relations between coordinates.

### 18th century

Calculus was developed using the notion of variables with their associated geometric meaning, which persisted well into the 18th century. The emergence of a notion of function as an individualized mathematical entity can be traced to the beginnings of infinitesimal calculus. (Ponte, 1992).

The term "function" was literally introduced by Gottfried Leibniz, in his 1673's letter to Bernoulli, in which Leibniz describes a quantity related to points of a curve, such as a coordinate or curve's slope. Eves dates Leibniz's first use to the year 1694, and also similarly relates the use to "as a term to denote any quantity connected with a curve, such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the slope of the curve, and so on." (Eves, 1990).

Johann Bernoulli started calling expressions made of a single variable "functions". In 1698, he agreed with Leibniz that any quantity formed in an algebraic and transcendental manner may be called a function of `x`. By 1718, he came to regard as a function any expression made up of a variable and some constants.

Alexis Claude Clairaut (in cca. 1734) and Leonhard Euler introduced the familiar notation `f(x)` for the value of a function.

The functions considered in those times are today called *differentiable functions*. For this type of function, one can talk about limits and derivatives; both are measurements of the output or the change in the output as it depends on the input or the change in the input. Such functions are the basis of calculus.
