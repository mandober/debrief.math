## Functions are relations

Relations are a generalization of functions - in fact, all functions are relations, only relations with a certain special property.


are special types of relations, i.e. relations



In mathematics, a **function** is defined as a relation that associates each element of a domain set to exactly one element of a codomain set.

All functions are relations. Only relations that have the *property of functionality*, or the *functional property*, or relations that are said to be *functional*, are functions. The crucial property of functions is actually called **univalence**

*Univalent function* - an injective holomorphic function on an open subset of the complex plane.

Univalent relation - a binary relation R that satisfies `xRy ∧ xRz ⇒ y=z`.




- correspondence
- rule
- association
- mapping


This is the *crucial property of functions*. If some domain element were to be related to more then one codomain elements, then that would not be a function, but a *relation*. However, if some domain element is not related at all, that could still be a function, albeit a *partial function*, provided the crucial property still holds for those domain elements that are related.

If 
  `∀x ∈ A. ∃y ∈ B. f x = y`
then 
  `f : A -> B` is a function

`∀x₁x₂ ∈ A. f x₁ = f x₂`
