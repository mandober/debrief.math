# Math :: Functions :: Function notation

## Function notation

- function name
- named functions
- anonymous functions
- lambda function
- formal parameter
- function value
- function head
- function body


The ubiquitous notation for denoting a function in mathematics is the form

`f(x) = y`

where
- `f` is a *function's name*
- `x` is a *formal paramater*
- `y` represents a *function's value*

The form `f(x) = y` is an *equation*


Alternative but equivalent forms include
- `f x = y`   form that skips parenthesis
- `x ↦ f (x)` form that emphasizes the mapping of an object
- `x ⟼ f  x`  form that emphasizes the mapping of an object
- `x -ᶠ->  y`  form that emphasizes the mapping of an object
- `λx.M`      general form of lambda abstractions, `M` is an arbitrary exp




of the function, i.e. *function value*, although `y` may also be considered as an abstract representation of the *function's body*.




This notation represents the most general form functions take. An example of a concrete function that conforms to this notation is

    sq(x) = x²

where
- `sq` is function's name
- `x` is the function's formal parameter
- `x²` is the body of the function, i.e. function's value

Another example is a binary function:

    add(x, y) = x + y

where
- `add` is function's name
- `x` and `y` are formal parameters
- `x + y` is the function body
