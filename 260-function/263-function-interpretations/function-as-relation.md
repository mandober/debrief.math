# Function as relation

The view of *function-as-relation*, 
or more preciselly, *function-as-restricted-relation*, 
is a set-theoretical view of *function-as-set*.


All functions are relations. 

Functions are a special type of relations. 
Not all relations are functions. To be a function, a relation must be left-serial and right-unique.
