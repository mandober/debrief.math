# Interpretations of functions

The notion of a function has different interpretations depending on the encompassing theory.

In mathematics
  - Relation theory
    - relation-theoretical interpretation
    - function as a special type of relation
  - Set theory
    - set-theoretical interpretation
    - function as a set
  - Group theory
    - group-theoretical interpretation
    - functions are homomorphisms
  - Type theory
    - type-theoretical interpretation
    - function are type constructors
  - Category theory
    - category-theoretical interpretation
    - arrows are a generalization of functions
- In CS, in Programming Language Theory, as callables
    - subroutine (block, subprogram)
    - procedure (effectful subroutine, often without return value)
    - function (effectful subroutine)
    - pure function (close to a mathematical function)
    - expression function
    - statement function
    - function as an object (e.g. in JS, an object with properties)
    - named function
    - anonymous function
    - closure (function that can close over its current env)
    - lambda function (anonymous closure)

Interpretations of the notion of a mathematical function:
- function-as-relation
- function-as-set
- function-as-table
- function-as-graph
- function-as-rule
- function-as-black-box
- function-as-mapping
- function-as-transformation
- function-as-morphism
