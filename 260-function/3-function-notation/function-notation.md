# Function :: Function notation

## Generic function notation

Euler has introduced the notation `y = f(x)` for a function `f`, its variable `x` and its value `y`.

## Referencing a function



The notation `f(x)` is often used to denote any function in general; it denotes any arbitrary, generic function.


may denote an arbitrary generic function of one variable (unary function). 

The function's name is `f`, which is a name also frequently used for concrete functions, along with `g` and `h`.

The notation `f(x) = y` is actually like a template for functions. It signifies that unary functions take a single argument, here denoted by `x`, as input and return a single value as output (aka return value), here denoted by `y`.

`f(x)` vs `f` vs `f(x) = y` vs `f(x) = x² + 2`


## Function name

By convention, letter `f` is overused as function name, along with the subsequent letters `g` and `h`.

Function name gives a way to identify a function. We use the name to refer to a function itself, which means referring to the function definition.


`f` is used as a generic name, as for an arbitrary function to showcase the notation, but also as a name of concrete functions.


## Concrete function notation

`f(x) = x²` defines a concrete function.

## Function notation

- function name
- named functions
- anonymous functions
- lambda function
- formal parameter
- function value
- function head
- function body


The ubiquitous notation for denoting a function in mathematics is the form

`f(x) = y`

where
- `f` is a *function's name*
- `x` is a *formal paramater*
- `y` represents a *function's value*

The form `f(x) = y` is an *equation*


Alternative but equivalent forms include
- `f x = y`   form that skips parenthesis
- `x ↦ f (x)` form that emphasizes the mapping of an object
- `x ⟼ f  x`  form that emphasizes the mapping of an object
- `x -ᶠ->  y`  form that emphasizes the mapping of an object
- `λx.M`      general form of lambda abstractions, `M` is an arbitrary exp




of the function, i.e. *function value*, although `y` may also be considered as an abstract representation of the *function's body*.




This notation represents the most general form functions take. An example of a concrete function that conforms to this notation is

    sq(x) = x²

where
- `sq` is function's name
- `x` is the function's formal parameter
- `x²` is the body of the function, i.e. function's value

Another example is a binary function:

    add(x, y) = x + y

where
- `add` is function's name
- `x` and `y` are formal parameters
- `x + y` is the function body
