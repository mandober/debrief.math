# Algebra of functions

Algebra of functions deals with the arithmetic operations of the functions. For doing any arithmetic operation of two functions, their domains must be the same (or restricted to the same domain).

Algebra of functions mainly deals with the following four arithmetic operations of functions:
- addition of functions,       g(x) + f(x) = (f + g)(x)
- subtraction of functions,     g(x) - f(x) = (f - g)(x)
- multiplication of functions, g(x) × f(x) = (f × g)(x)
- division of functions,       g(x) ÷ f(x) = (f ÷ g)(x),  if g(x) ≠ 0

Apart from these operations there is also
- composition of functions
- inverse functions

## Operations

If two functions have a common domain, then arithmetic operations can be performed on them.

The domain of the arithmetic operation of two functions is the *intersection of the domain* of the independent functions.

### Addition of Functions

The domain of the sum of two functions is the intersection of the domain of the independent functions.

The *sum* of two functions at a given input is equal to the sum of the independent functions at the same input.

(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)

Example: 
if  f(x) = x² + 2 
and g(x) = x + 1, 
then 
(f + g)(x) 
= f(x) + g(x) 
= (x² + 2) + (x + 1) 
= x² + x + 3 

Since the domain of `f` and `g` is ℝ, the domain of `(f + g)(x)` is `ℝ ∩ ℝ = ℝ`.

### Subtraction of Functions

The *difference* of two functions at a given input is equal to the difference of the independent functions at the same input.

Example: if f(x) = x² + 2 and g(x) = x + 1, then 
(f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x) 
= x² + 2 - (x + 1) 
= x² - x + 1

### Multiplication of Functions

The *product* of two functions at a given input is equal to the product of the independent functions at the same input. The product of functions results in a binomial function, cubic function, or a polynomial function.

Example: if f(x) = x² + 2 and g(x) = x + 1, then 
(f · g)(x) = f(x) · g(x) 
= (x² + 2) · (x + 1) 
= x³ + x² + 2x + 2

### Division of Functions

The domain of the *quotient* of two functions is the intersection of the domain of the independent functions. But we have to take care of the extra condition, setting the denominator function to "not equal to 0" because if the denominator is 0, then the fraction is undefined. The quotient of two functions at a given input is equal to the quotient of the independent functions at the same input.

(f / g) (x) = f(x) / g(x), given g(x) ≠ 0

Example: if f(x) = x² + 2 and g(x) = x + 1, then 
(f / g)(x) = f(x) / g(x) 
= (x² + 2) / (x + 1)

Since the domain of each of f(x) is ℝ; and the domain of g(x) is `ℝ ∖ {-1}` because x+1 is in the denominator, x+1≠0 ⇒ x≠-1.
