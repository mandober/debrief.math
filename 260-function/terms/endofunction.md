# Endofunction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endofunction

An **endofunction** is a function whose domain is equal to its codomain.

A homomorphic endofunction is an endomorphism. A *homomorphism* is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type.

Let `S` be an arbitrary set. Among endofunctions on `S`, one finds permutations of `S` and *constant functions* associating to every `x` in `S` the same element `c` in `S`.

Every permutation of `S` has the codomain equal to its domain and is bijective and *invertible*. If `S` has more than one element, a constant function on `S` has an *image* that is a proper subset of its codomain, and thus is not bijective (and hence not invertible).

The function associating to each natural number `n` the floor of `n/2` has its image equal to its codomain and is not invertible.

Finite endofunctions are equivalent to directed pseudoforests.

For sets of size `n` there are `n‚Åø` endofunctions on the set. Particular examples of bijective endofunctions are the *involutions*, i.e. the functions coinciding with their inverses.
