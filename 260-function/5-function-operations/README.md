## Operations on functions

The only essential thing we do with a function is to apply it.

Since functions are values, they are subject to various mathematical operations (manipulations).
- arithemtic manipulations
  - elementary: {+ - × ÷}
  - other: ^ (↑), ↑↑, %, !, (mod m)
- restriction
  - restricting domain of a function
  - restricting range of a function
- iteration
  - applying



- finding the inverse of a function
  - when inverse of a function is a function
  - when inverse of a function is not a function
    - restricting domain and range
