# Preimage

A preimage of a function `f : A → B` is especially important for surjections where the same element of the codomain `B` is associated to more then one element of the domain `A`. The inverse of a surjection cannot be a regular function, but it may be a set-valued function where each element of the codomain in mapped to a set of domain elements with which it is associated.

∀b ∈ B. ∃z ⊆ A. z = { f(a) = b }
