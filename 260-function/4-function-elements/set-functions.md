# Set functions

>>If one agrees that (ZFC) set theory is an appealing foundation of mathematics, then all mathematical objects must be defined as sets.

>In practice, however, as soon as a new mathematical object is defined, it ceases to be identified with sets, and becomes an independent, standalone object in its own right.

For example, an ordered pair `(a, b)` has an "offical" definition in terms of sets (which, by the way, came long after the introduction of ordered pairs, largely as the "let's see if/how it can be done" challenge), but as soon as this curiosity was satisfied

it was shown it can be done, ordered pairs have become mathematical objects different from sets (different, incomparable types). The definition of an ordered pair on which the mathematical community have settled is one by Kuratowski: `(a, b) := {{a}, {a, b}}`.

Therefore, functions are relations between sets, and functions *per se* are also sets.

>All functions are (sets) defined between sets.

Functions are the same set as relations - set of ordered pairs. This set of ordered pairs is called the graph of the function. It represents the set of all the individual input-output associations. In a relation `R` between the set `A` and `B`, `R ⊆ A×B`, individual associations are denoted by `(a, b) ∈ R` with `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`. With relations, as with functions, the set `A` is also called domain, and B is codomain. However, a relation between these teo sets is specified by `R ⊆ A×B`, while a function is `f : A → B` instead. With functions, associations of elements are also denoted differently, `f(a) = b`, instead of `(a, b) ∈ f` as is the case with relations.
