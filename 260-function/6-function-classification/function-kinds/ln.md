# Natural logarithm

Natural logarithm, `ln`, aka logarithm base `e` of `x`, i.e. `logₑx`.

The natural logarithm (base `e` logarithm) of a positive real number `x`, represented by `ln x`, aka `logₑ x`, is the exponent to which the base `e` is raised to obtain `x`.

`e` is the Euler's number, `e ≈ 2.718`
