# Linear functions

## Definition: Linear Function

A linear function is a function whose graph produces a line.

Linear functions can be written in any of these forms
- standard form:        f(x) = ax + b
- slope-intercept form: f(x) = mx + b
- polynomial form:      f(x) = c₀x⁰ + c₁x¹ = c₀ + c₁x

where (in `mx+b`)
- `m` is the slope, aka the constant rate of change of the function
- `b` is the x-intercept, aka the value of the function when input `x=0`


## Definition: slope and monotonicity

increasing/decreasing

## Slope

The slope determines if the function is monotonic. 
A monotonic function is one that is either increasing or decreasing:
- slope positive  ⇒ monotonically increasing, graph like a slash, `/`
- slope negative  ⇒ monotonically decreasing, graph like a backslash, `\`
- slope zero      ⇒ neither increasing nor decreasing, graph flatlines, `__`
- slope undefined ⇒ neither inc/dec, graph goes into v-fib `|`

Slope
- if `m > 0`, then `f(x) = b + mx` is an increasing function
- if `m < 0`, then `f(x) = b + mx` is a decreasing function
- if `m = 0`, then `f(x) = b + mx` is neither increasing nor decreasing, but collapses into a constant function, `f(x) = b+0x = b`, the graph of which is a horizontal line passing through the point `(0, b)`. With `m=0`, the rate of change is zero.

If the slope is positive, `m > 0`, 
then the linear function, `f(x) = mx + b`, 
is an increasing function, 
aka monotonically increasing function, 

In the *slope-intercept form of line equation*, `y = mx + b`, the constant `b` specifies the *x-intercept* directly, making this form of equation preferable for situations when the x-intercept is of interest.


i.e. the point of the form `(x,0)` - thus a point on the x-axis where y-values are always 0 - where the line intersects the x-axis; e.g. the line `2x + 3` intersects the x-axis at the point `(3, 0)`, and the line `x - 3⁄8` intersects the x-axis at the point `(0.375, 0)`.

To find out the *y-intercept*
The horizontal intercept of the function is where the graph crosses the horizontal axis. If a function has a horizontal intercept, you can always find it by solving  f(x)=0
