# Exponential functions

Exponential functions are those with the input `x` in the exponent while the base can be anything. Canonically, the base is the constant `e` which makes for the `exp(x)` or `eˣ` function. All other exponential functions can be defined in terms of the `exp(x)` function.

>bˣ = eˣˡⁿ⁽ᵇ⁾  for all b ∈ ℝ, b > 0

The `exp(x)` function can be defined as the limit `lim{n→∞} (1+x/n)ⁿ`.
