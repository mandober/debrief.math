# Logarithmic functions 

The formal definition of a logarithm:

>f(x) = logₐ x
- log₂ x = lg(x)
- log₁₀ x = log(x)
- logₑ x = ln(x)

The base `a` logarithm of a positive number `x` is the exponent you get when you write `x` as a power of `a`, where `a > 1` (and `a ≠ 1`). That is, 

    logₐ x = k    iff aᵏ = x
