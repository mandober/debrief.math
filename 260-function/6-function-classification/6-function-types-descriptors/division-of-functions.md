# Division of functions

All properties of functions

* wrt relations
  - functional relation
  - relations that are left-unique and right-serial
  - Fn ⊆ Rel ⊆ Dom⨯Cod (elements are ordered pairs)
  - a rel R: xRy ≡ (x,y) ∈ R, R = {(x,y) | x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ B}

* by involved sets
  - domain
    - preimage
  - codomain
    - range
    - image

* by injectivity
  - (a relation ↓)
  - (a function ↓)
  - surjection  ↓ onto
  - injection   ↓ one-to-one
  - bijection   ↓ one-to-one correspondence

* by totality
  - total functions
  - partial functions
