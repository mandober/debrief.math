# Functions :: Function types :: Descriptors

Pages here about descriptors used to classify functions and their properties.

It is about the differences between various categories functions, like e.g., the difference between the inverse functions vs logarithmic functions, which is in the fact that invertability  ("has") is a more general property that may pertain to any function, while only certain functions are logarithmic ("is"). Yes, it may be a difference between characteristics ("is logarithmic and not trigonometric") and attributes ("has the property of being infinitily differentiable") and potential transformations ("has a straightup inverse, no restricting the domain needed"). On the other hand, Ackermann function may or may not have a single definite referant (like some particular, "the" Ackermann function), or it perhaps refers to a whole family of closely related functions, starting with the original Ackermann function and its derivations and various versions. If know what I mean. Them's the apples. Are you yes or are you not recursive, piecewise, empty, Boolean-valued, constant, partial, smooth, analyzable?
