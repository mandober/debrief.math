# List of types of functions

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_functions

Types of functions: criteria, factors, properties of/for division
- properties:
  - arity
  - input value
  - output value, function value, X-valued function

Functions by I/O
- input: argument ‚àà domain
- output: return value ‚àà codomain (range ‚äÜ codomain)

Functions by value (by output)
- `T`-valued function (fn returning type `X`: (sub)set, class, powerset, ‚Ä¶)
  - set-valued function, A ‚Üí B
  - powerset valued function, A ‚Üí ùí´(A)

- Boolean function, ùîπ ‚Üí ùîπ
- Boolean-valued function, A ‚Üí ùîπ
- ‚Ñï-valued function, A ‚Üí ‚Ñï

Functions by arity
- nullary function
- unary function
- binry function
- polyadic (n-ary) function

- total function
- partial function
- injection
- surjection
- bijection
- projection
- identity function
- constant function
  - zero function (n-ary function that always returns 0)
- fixpoint function (returns a fixpoint of the input function)
- higher-order function
- PRF
- GRF
- inverse function
- composed function
- parametrically polymorphic
- pure function (finite map, finite mapping)
- memoized function
- combinators
- finite function
- continuous function
- Galois connected function
- empty function
- set function
- choice function (selector, uniformizing function) assigns to each set one of its elements
- characteristic function
- Monotonic function: does not reverse the ordering of any pair of inputs.
- Strict monotonic function: preserves the given order.
- Arithmetic function: A function from the positive integers into the complex numbers.
- Differentiable function: Has a derivative.
- Elementary function: composition of arithmetic operations, exponentials, logarithms, constants, and solutions of algebraic equations.
- Special functions: non-elementary functions that have established names and notations due to their importance.
- Trigonometric functions: relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides.
- Nowhere differentiable function called also Weierstrass function: continuous everywhere but not differentiable even at a single point.
- Fast-growing (or rapidly increasing) function; in particular, Ackermann function.
- Simple function: a real-valued function over a subset of the real line, similar to a step function.
- recursive function
- Symmetric function: value is independent of the order of its arguments
- Multivalued function: one-to-many relation.
- Random function: Random element of a set of functions.


## Relative to dimension of domain and codomain
- Scalar-valued function
- Multivariate function
- Vector-valued function

## Ways of defining functions/relation to type theory

- Polynomial function: defined by evaluating a polynomial.
- Rational function: ratio of two polynomial functions. In particular, M√∂bius transformation called also linear fractional function.
- Algebraic function: defined as the root of a polynomial equation.
- Transcendental function: analytic but not algebraic. Also hypertranscendental function.
- Composite function: is formed by the composition of two functions f and g, by mapping x to f‚Ää(g(x)).
- Inverse function: is declared by "doing the reverse" of a given function (e.g. arcsine is the inverse of sine).
- Implicit function: defined implicitly by a relation between the argument(s) and the value.
Piecewise function: is defined by different expressions on different intervals.
- Computable function: an algorithm can do the job of the function. Also semicomputable function; primitive recursive function; partial recursive function.

In general, functions are often defined by specifying the name of a dependent variable, and a way of calculating what it should map to. For this purpose, the `‚Ü¶` symbol or Church's Œª is often used. Also, sometimes mathematicians notate a function's domain and codomain by writing e.g. f:A‚ÜíB. These notions extend directly to lambda calculus and type theory, respectively.

## Higher order functions
These are functions that operate on functions or produce other functions; see Higher order function. Examples are:
- Function composition.
- Integral and differential operators.
- Fourier transforms.
- Fold and Map operations.
- Currying
