# Preimage

- Let `f : X → Y` be a map.
- Given any subset `S ⊆ X`
- Define the *image* under `f` to be the set `f(S) := { f(s) | s ∈ S }`, 
  i.e. `f(S) ⊆ Y` be set `Z = f(S)`. The function f than associates each `s ∈ S` to a `z ∈ Z`, as if `f: S → Z`, so `f(s) = z`, but really `f: S → f(S)`.
- Define its *preimage* (i.e. inverse image) under `f` to be the set: 
  `f⁻¹(S) := { x ∈ X | f(x) ∈ S }`
