**Rational function** is any function which can be defined by a *rational fraction*, i.e. an *algebraic fraction* such that both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials.

(Definition). A function `f(x)` is called a rational function iff it can be written in the form `f(x) = P(x)/Q(x)` where `P` and `Q` are polynomials in `x` and `Q` is not the *zero polynomial* (i.e. 0). The domain of a function `f` is the set of all points `x` for which the denominator `Q(x)` is not zero.

Every polynomial function `f(x) = P(x)` is a trivially a rational function by setting `Q(x) = 1`. Functions that cannot be written in this form, such as `f(x) = sin(x)`, are not rational functions. The adjective "irrational" is not generally used for functions.

It can be proved that sum, product and quotient (except division by the zero polynomial which will cause the function to be undefined) of rational functions produce rational functions as well.
