# Limit of a function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function

The *limit of a function* is a fundamental concept in Analysis concerning the behavior of the function near a particular input value which may or may not be in the domain of the function.

Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below.

Informally, a function `f` assigns an output `f(x)` to every input `x`. We say that the function has a limit `L` at an input `p`, if `f(x)` gets closer and closer to `L` as `x` moves closer and closer to `p`.

More specifically, the output value can be made arbitrarily close to `L` if the input to `f` is taken sufficiently close to `p`. On the other hand, if some inputs very close to `p` are taken to outputs that stay a fixed distance apart, then we say the limit does not exist.

The notion of a limit has many applications in modern calculus. In particular, the many definitions of *continuity* employ the concept of limit: roughly, a *function is continuous* if all of its limits agree with the values of the function.

The concept of limit also appears in the definition of the *derivative*: in the calculus of one variable, this is the limiting value of the slope of secant lines to the graph of a function.

Although the function `⁠sin(x)/x` is not defined at 0, as `x` (in radians) comes closer and closer to zero, ⁠`sin(x)/x`⁠ comes arbitrarily close to 1. In other words, the limit of ⁠`sin(x)/x`,⁠ as `x` approaches 0, equals 1.

    lim{x→0} sin(x)/x = 1

x (in rad) | sin(x)/x
-----------|---------------------
1          | 0.841471…
0.1        | 0.998334…
0.01       | 0.999983…
0.001      | 0.99999983…
0.0001     | 0.9999999983…
0.00001    | 0.999999999983…
0.000001   | 0.99999999999983…
0.0000001  | 0.9999999999999983…
0.00000001 | 0.999999999999999983…
-0.0000001 | 0.9999999999999983…
-0.001     | 0.99999983…

The limits from both sides, as `x` tends to 0, agree.
