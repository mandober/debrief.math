# Functions :: Trajections

Trajections:
- injection, one-to-one mapping
- surjection, onto
- bijection, one-to-one and onto mapping, one-to-one correspondance

Cardinalities:
- Injections:  |dom| = |ran| < |cod|
- Surjections: |dom| > |ran| = |cod|
- Bijections:  |dom| = |ran| = |cod|


Compositions
- bijections < surjections < surjections (memo: `b < i < s`)
- pre- or post-composing a surjection with any function, gives a surjection
- pre- or post-composing an injection with a bijection, gives an injection
- composition of trajection with itself gives that trajection still

- composition of surjection and any function, gives a surjection
- composition of injection and bijection, gives an injection

- composition of surjections gives more surjective functions (more collapse)
- surjections collapse elements and with that loose information
- the essential properties of surjections:
  - sometimes the emphasis is on the coverage of the entire codomain
  - sometimes it is that more than 1 dom element maps the same cod element
