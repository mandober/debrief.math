# Function Theory :: Definitions :: Surjection

A surjection (surjective function, onto function) is 
a function `f : A -> B`
0. a relation,   `f ⊆ A⨯B`
1. right-unique: `∀a,a′ ∈ A. ∃b ∈ B. f(a) = f(a′) ⟹ a = a′`
2. left-total:   `∀a    ∈ A. ∃b ∈ B. f(a) = b`
that is also
3. left-unique:  `∀b ∈ B. ∃a ∈ A. f(x) = b`


In a surjective function `f : A -> B`, 
every element `b` in the codomain 
is assigned to 
some element `a` in the domain, 
such that `f(a) = b`.

>In other words, every element of the function's codomain is an image of at least one element of its domain.

(it is not required that `a` be unique: the function `f` may map one or more elements of `A` to the same element `b` of `B`).

Properties
- `f` is a relation, f ⊆ A⨯B
