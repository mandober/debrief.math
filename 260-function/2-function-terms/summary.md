# Functions :: Summary

- Functions are relations with extra constraints.
- A serial relation has the entire domain covered.
- Total functions are left-serial and right-unique relations.
- Partial function loose the left-serial property.

- functions are mappings between sets
- the essentail property of functions is that a domain element is associated to at most 1 codomain element (either 0 or 1). `f(x) = f(y) -> x = y`
- In total functions, all domain elements participate in the relation, i.e. the entire domain is covered.
- In partial functions, not all domain elements participate in the relation, i.e. the entire domain is not covered. However, at least one domain element must participate. Usually, only a few elements don't participate - the function is not defined for them.
