# Functions :: Surjection


A function `f : A -> B` is surjective iff 
`∀b ∈ B. ∃a ∈ A. f(a) = b`

A function `f : A -> B` is surjective iff `ran(f) = cod(f)`, 
or, equivalently `f(A) = B` 
i.e. the image of `A` is `B`, `img(A) = B`


- composition of surjection and any function, gives a surjection
- composition of injection and bijection, gives an injection

- composition of surjections gives more surjective functions (more collapse)
- surjections collapse elements and with that loose information
- the essential properties of surjections:
  - sometimes the emphasis is on the coverage of the entire codomain
  - sometimes it is that more than 1 dom element maps the same cod element

- Surjections: |dom| > |ran| = |cod|


## Composition of surjections is a surjection

Let `f : A -> B` and `g : B -> C`. 
If `f` and `g` are surjections then 
`g ∘ f` is a surjection (`s ∘ s : s`)

Proof:
- Let `c` be an arbitrary element in set `C`
- since `g` is a surjection, there's an element `b ∈ B` such that `c = g b`
- since `f` is a surjection, there's an element `a ∈ A` such that `b = f a`
- Hence by the definition of composite function, `c = g (f a) = (g ∘ f)(a)`
- Hence, `g ∘ f` is a surjection (_?!_)
