# Functions :: Injection

The function is injective, or one-to-one, if each element of the codomain is mapped to by at most one element of the domain. Or, equivalently, if distinct elements of the domain map to distinct elements in the codomain.

A function `f : A -> B` is injective if 
`∀a,a' ∈ A. f(a) = f(a') -> a = a'`

The contrapositive of this implication is 
`∀a,a' ∈ A. a ≠ a' -> f(a) ≠ f(a')`

- Injections:  |dom| = |ran| < |cod|

- Surjections: |dom| > |ran| = |cod|

- Bijections:  |dom| = |ran| = |cod|



- Injections preserve distinctness of elements.
- The inverse of an injective-only function is a partial function.


- Composition
  - pre- or post-composing a surjection with any function, gives a surjection.
  - composition of injections is an injection.
  - pre- or post-composing an injection with a bijection, gives an injection.

- Homogeneous functions (endofunctions) on a finite set, `f : A -> A`
  - all injective endofunctions on a finite set are actually bijections 
    i.e. there are no injective-only functions
  - but injection-only endofunctions on an infinite set are possible 
    e.g. `succ : ℕ -> ℕ`
