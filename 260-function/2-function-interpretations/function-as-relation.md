# Function as a relation

The view of functions as relations, or more preciselly, functions as restricted relations, is a set-theoretical view of functions-as-sets.

All functions are relations, but with additional constraints. A function is actually a relation that is left-total and right-unique.

Right-uniqueness is the most important property of functions. If this property is broken, the relation cannot be a function. This property ensures that a domain elemenet has only a single codomain element to which it is associated. There cannot ever be a "fork" or two arrows originating from the same domain element but each going to a different codomain element. Both total and partial functions must satisfy this axiom or they cannot be functions.

The property of left-totality is only related to total functions. It states that all domain elements must participate in the relation - there may be no execeptions like with partial functions.

Save fro these two conditions, underneath, however, relations and functions are the same. Both are associatiations between sets. Any unary function corresponds to a particualr binary relation. Although they seemingly have different arities, the fact is, their graphs are the same. The graph of a relation (or function) is a set of ordered pairs. These ordered pairs `(a, b)` always have the first component coming from the domain set, while the second component is from the codomain set.

A *relation* `R` is a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets, `R ⊆ A×B`. A *function* `f`, being a relation, is also a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets, but functions are instead denoted by `f : A → B`.
