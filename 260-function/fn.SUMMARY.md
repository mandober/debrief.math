# Functions ‚à∑ SUMMARY

* `f : A -> B` is a function signature consisting of the function name (f), the domain (A) and codomain (B). There's no telling what a math function does from the signature alone. However, a function definition is incomplete if it lacks the signature because the codomain is only specified there.

* Strictly, two identical functions that differ only in the codomain are not actually the same, e.g. `f : ‚Ñï -> ‚Ñï, f(x) = x¬≤` ‚â† `g : ‚Ñï -> ‚Ñ§, g(x) = x¬≤`.

* If a function's definition produces a stable range, then the codomain can shrink (`ran = cod`) or grow (`ran ‚äÇ cod`) without affecting the range. However, each change of the codomain yields a different function.

* Thus, a function is a fully specified as a triple `ùìï = (f, A, B)`

* A function `f : A -> B`, with `x‚ÇÅ,x‚ÇÇ ‚àà A` and `y ‚àà B`, is a specialized relation, `R ‚äÜ A ‚®Ø B`, in that `(x‚ÇÅR‚Åüy ‚ãÄ x‚ÇÇR‚Åüy) -> (x‚ÇÅ = x‚ÇÇ)`

* The vertical line test states that a graph represents a function iff all vertical lines intersect the graph at most once.

* Given a graph that represents a function, the horizontal line test states that a graph represents an injective function iff all horizontal lines intersect the graph at most once.

* Surjections have equinumerous range and codomain     |dom| ‚©æ `|ran| = |cod|`
* Injections have equinumerous domain and range        `|dom| = |ran|` ‚©Ω |cod|
* Bijections have equinumerous domain, range, codomain `|dom| = |ran| = |cod|`
