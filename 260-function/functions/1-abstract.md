# Function Theory :: Functions :: Abstract

The subject of functions makes for an enormous topic in mathematics, especially when extending the exploration of functions to computer science as well.

The concept of a function is faily digestable, it is unclear how can such a simple notion spawn so many related aspects it becomes impossible to describe the lot. The mere list of terms related to functions is uncountably infinite. The structure needed to hierarchically representat all the relevant topics about functions must be a coinductively defined, infinite, corecursive codata structure. Having failed to come with one, an alternative approach is selected: "pile o'pages", aka it puts the notion in the basket.
