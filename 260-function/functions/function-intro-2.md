## Functions in Math

### Origin of function

Functions have started their career at least somewhere at the dawn of calculus, probably even before that, as a means of expressing the dependency of one value on another. In the simplest, a quantity called *output* depends on another quantity, called *input*. Input quantity is traditionally denoted with variable `x` and output quantity with `y`, while the conventional for a function is `‚®ç`. All together they form the expression `f(x) = y`, which should be interpreted as the most general way to describe and denote a (unary) function.
