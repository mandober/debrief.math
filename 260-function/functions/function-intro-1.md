# Functions :: Intro



Functions provide the basic means of abstraction in many PL. FPLs rely exclusively on functions (if you want) to get the job done (correctly). Lambda calculus has demonstrated them that no other language constructs are ever even needed (apart as sugar).

Functions manifest *determinancy*, exactly because a domain element can only be associated with a single codomain element. All functions are relations, but relations, in genaral, do not have this constraint, so *relational calculi* manifest *indeterminancy* since a domain element can be associated with more than one codomain element.
