# Function Theory :: GLOSSARY


## Brouwer's fixpoint theorem
Brouwer's fixpoint theorem says that any continuous function from a closed ball into itself in Euclidean space must have a fixpoint.

## General Recursive Function
A general recursive function (aka partial recursive function or μ-recursive function) is a number-theoretic partial function computable in the Church-Turing sense and in a formal sense.

## Knaster-Tarski theorem
The Knaster-Tarski theorem says that any order-preserving function on a complete lattice has a complete lattice of fixpoints.

## μ-recursive function
(see General Recursive Function)

## Total Recursive Function
A total recursive function (often just "recursive function") is a general recursive function that is total.

## Partial function
A function that is undefined (not defined) for some domain elements. For example, the division function on ℝ is not defined when the devisor is 0.

## Permutation
A permutation of a set `S` is defined as a bijective from `S` to itself, for which every element occurs exactly once as an image value. This is related to the rearrangement of the elements of `S` in which each element `s` is replaced by the corresponding `f(s)`. For example, the permutation `(3,1,2)` is described by the function `α` defined as `α(1) = 3`, `α(2) = 1`, `α(3) = 2`.
