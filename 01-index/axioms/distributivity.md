# Distributivity

Algebraic structures consisting of 2 binary operations (e.g. ring) are subject to distributivity of one operation over the other.

Given a set `S` and 2 binary operators `*` and `+` on `S`:
- the operation `*` is **left-distributive** over `+` if    
  $$(\forall x,y,z \in S)\ .\ x*(y+z) = (x*y) + (x*z)$$
- the operation `*` is **right-distributive** over `+` if     
  $$(\forall x,y,z \in S)\ .\ (y+z)*x=(y*x)+(z*x)$$
- the operation `*` is **distributive** over `+` if it both left and right-distributive.
- when `*` is commutative, these 3 conditions are logically equivalent


a(b + c) = ab + ac



- The Distributive Law does not work for division
