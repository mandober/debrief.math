# Logical reasoning

There are 3 kinds of reasoning: abductive, inductive and deductive. Each kind of reasoning has a logic of the same name that studies it: abduction, induction and deduction.

**Abduction** is a form of logical inference which starts with observations, then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. This kind of reasoning can be used to develop a hypothesis, which in turn can be tested by additional reasoning or data. Diagnosticians, detectives and scientists often use this type of reasoning.

**Induction** is a method of reasoning in which the premises contribute some justification for the truth of the conclusion. The truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is never certain because it is generally based on the previous experience and the likelihood of it repeating. Science is associated with this type of reasoning. N.B. Inductive reasoning (inductive logic) and mathematical induction are completelly different things.

**Deduction** (deductive logic, logical deduction) is the process of reasoning that starts with premises and proceeds to reach, a logically certain, conclusion. If all premises are true and the rules were strictly followed, then the conclusion is necessarily true. Mathematics is associated with deductive reasoning.
