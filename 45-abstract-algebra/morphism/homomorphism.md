# Homomorphism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism


**Homomorphism** is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, two vector spaces).

The word comes from the ancient Greek: ὁμός (homos) meaning "same" and μορφή (morphe) meaning "form" or "shape". However, the word was apparently introduced to mathematics due to a mistranslation of German `ähnlich` meaning "similar" to `ὁμός` meaning "same".

Homomorphisms of vector spaces are also called linear maps, and their study is the object of linear algebra.

The concept of homomorphism has been generalized, under the name of *morphism*, to many other structures that either do not have an underlying set, or are not algebraic. This generalization is the starting point of *category theory*.

A homomorphism may also be an isomorphism, an endomorphism, an automorphism, etc. Each of those can be defined in a way that may be generalized to any class of morphisms.
