* From 3000 BCE the Mesopotamian states of Sumer, Akkad and Assyria, followed closely by Ancient Egypt and the Levantine state of Ebla began using *arithmetic*, *algebra* and *geometry* for taxation, commerce, trade, but also in astronomy, to record time and formulate calendars.

* The oldest mathematical texts:
- c.1950 BCE `Plimpton 322`, Babylon
- c.1800 BCE `Rhind Mathematical Papyrus`, Egypt
- c.1890 BCE `Moscow Mathematical Papyrus`, Egypt

* All of these texts mention the *Pythagorean triples* making the **Pythagorean theorem** probably the most ancient and widespread piece of mathematical knowledge following the basic arithmetic and geometry.

* VI BCE: The study of mathematics as a "demonstrative discipline" began with the Pythagoreans, who coined the name *mathematics*, from the ancient Greek `μάθημα` (mathema) meaning "subject of instruction".


* BCE
- Aristotle sets the roots of formalised logic
- 4 BCE: `Elements` by Euclid, aximatic system of geometry; par excellence display of axiomatic approach and rigorous argumentation.

* XIX century
- 1860's Hermann Grassmann showed that many facts in arithmetic can be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction.
