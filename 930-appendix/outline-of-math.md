# Outline of mathematics - Wikipedia

Mathematics is a field of study that investigates topics such as number, space, structure, and change.
__[Mathematics][1]__ is a field of study that investigates topics such as [number][2], [space][3], [structure][4], and [change][5].

## Philosophy\[[edit][6]\]

### Nature\[[edit][7]\]

-   [Definitions of mathematics][8] – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.
-   [Language of mathematics][9] is the system used by [mathematicians][10] to communicate [mathematical][11] ideas among themselves, and is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity.[\[1\]][12]
-   [Philosophy of mathematics][13] – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

-   [Classical mathematics][14] refers generally to the mainstream approach to mathematics, which is based on classical [logic][15] and [ZFC set theory][16].
-   [Constructive mathematics][17] asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a mathematical object to prove that it exists. In classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption.
-   [Predicative mathematics][18]

### Mathematics is\[[edit][19]\]

-   An [academic discipline][20] – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
-   A [formal science][21] – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

### Concepts\[[edit][22]\]

-   [Mathematical object][23] — an [abstract concept][24] in [mathematics][25]; an *object* is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do [deductive reasoning][26] and [mathematical proofs][27]. Each branch of mathematics has its own objects.[\[a\]][28][\[b\]][29]
-   [Mathematical structure][30] — a [set][31] endowed with some additional features on the set (e.g., [operation][32], [relation][33], [metric][34], [topology][35]). A partial list of possible structures are [measures][36], [algebraic structures][37] ([groups][38], [fields][39], etc.), [topologies][40], [metric structures][41] ([geometries][42]), [orders][43], [events][44], [equivalence relations][45], [differential structures][46], and [categories][47].

-   [Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures][48]

-   [Abstraction][49] — the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and [generalizing][50] it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent [phenomena][51].

## Branches and subjects\[[edit][52]\]

### Quantity\[[edit][53]\]

-   [Number theory][54] is a branch of [pure mathematics][55] devoted primarily to the study of the [integers][56] and [integer-valued functions][57].
-   [Arithmetic][58] — (from the [Greek][59] [ἀριθμός][60] *arithmos*, 'number' and [τική][61] [\[τέχνη\]][62], *tiké \[téchne\]*, 'art') is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers and the properties of the traditional [mathematical operations][63] on them.

-   [Elementary arithmetic][64] is the part of arithmetic which deals with basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-   [Modular arithmetic][65]
-   [Second-order arithmetic][66] is a collection of axiomatic systems that formalize the natural numbers and their subsets.
-   [Peano axioms][67] also known as the Dedekind–Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano.
-   [Floating-point arithmetic][68] is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation to support a trade-off between range and precision.
