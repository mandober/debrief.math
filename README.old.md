## About

"Lo-fi collection of math notes".

"A collection of dissimilar nations lacking overall homogeneity".   





Intellectually, they knew there was no chance of her appeal succeeding, but logistically they were ready to succeed intuitively, or to succeed in never stopping succeeding. She thrashed around, trying to get loose, but only succeeding in making the bedsprings creak loudly. And you know how mathematicians say th

"Donnie, you're out of your element!"


An unremarkable copypasta of articles scrubbed largely from Wikipedia (and other sources) intended to be consulted if ever.

Each subsequent view of a page should succeed in accomplishing 0,1,2 things: verify comprehension, improve the summary, aid further digestion.

Should the internalization of material come to pass, relevant articles are to be compressed down to bare essentials expressed as bullits.

Note: classification of math topics still presents a difficult challenge. Many articles comprising a single topic are instead spread all over the place; consolidation ahoy.

## Dubious endorsements

* *"Endorsement of a particularly sensational, violent concept of mathematics that provokes and reflects the pervasive sense of embittered anger, confusing restlessness, socio-sexual frustration or otherwise derived alienation endured by a generation of disenfranchised devs, amidst the declining interests in denotational semantics and overall program correctness, smack right in the bug-ridden sigh of our times."* -- Simon Ferocious

* _"An almost language-free communication of ideas previously though improbable. The lure of imaginary is momentarily frozen before the dialectic of desire plugs the leaks of abstraction setting in motion the entirety of implied events."_-- Phineas Gage 👨‍🚒👨‍🚒

* _"C'est un espace trop chiffré, n'est-ce pas?"_ -- Abraham Surd 🪑🪑🪑

* _"Huius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet."_ -- F-Monk

* *...a preeminently peerless pile of 💩* -- drich
