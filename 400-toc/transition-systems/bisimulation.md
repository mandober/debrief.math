# Bisimulation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisimulation

In theoretical computer science, a **bisimulation** is a *binary relation between state transition systems*, associating systems that behave in the same way in that one system simulates the other and vice versa (the vice versa part is missing in the definition of simulation).

Intuitively two systems are bisimilar if they, assuming we view them as playing a game according to some rules, match each other's moves. In this sense, each of the systems cannot be distinguished from the other by an observer.
