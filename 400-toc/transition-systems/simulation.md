# Simulation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_(computer_science)

In theoretical computer science, a **simulation** is a *relation between state transition systems* associating systems that behave in the same way in the sense that one system simulates the other (but not vice versa, which would be the definition of bisimulation).

Intuitively, a system simulates another system if it can match all of its moves.

The basic definition relates states within one transition system, but this is easily adapted to relate two separate transition systems by building a system consisting of the disjoint union of the corresponding components.
