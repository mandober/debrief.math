https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_monoid

In mathematics and theoretical computer science, a **semiautomaton** (or transition monoid) is a DFA having inputs but no output.

A semiautomaton consists of a tiple `(Q, Σ, T)`
- `Q` set of states
- `Σ` input alphabet set
- `T : Q × Σ → Q` transition function
