# Alan Turing

Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Some biographyical data

Alan Mathison Turing was born on June, 23rd `1912` in London, Paddington. His father was a public servant in India and his mother was a daughter of a prominent engineer in Madras, India. Their children were raised by a retired colonel until the beginning of the WW2, after which their mother returned and remained home, in England.

In `1926`, Turing attended the boarding school in Sherborne. It was said that Turing was athletic but shy, introverted, clumsy, untidy, with an almost illegible hand-writing. In `1930`, Turing's first love, Christopher Morcom, died of tuberculosis. During `1931-1934`, Turing was on a scholarship in the King's College, Cambridge, under the professors like Hardy, Eddington and Newman. In `1935`, Turing became a fellow at Cambridge, where he published a proof demonstrating that some purely mathematical 'yes or no' questions can never be answered by computation. He defined a *Turing machine* and proved that the *halting problem* for Turing machines is undecidable.

Turing was working on his PhD during `1936-1938` at Princeton, where he met and associated with Church, Kleene, Gödel, Einstein and Von Neumann. `1939` was noted for his discussions with Wittgenstein.

After the WW2 broke out from `1939-1942`, Turing was part of the team at the Bletchley Park tasked to break the German cyphering machine called "enigma". For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. There, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the Polish bomba method (bomba was an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine). Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.

In `1947` Turing met with Konrand Zuse, German mathematician and engineer who constructed the world's first practical computer Z3. Zuse later imporved on it with Z4 model. In `1948`, Turing was involved with the *Mark I ACE* (Automatic Computing Engine), which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. Still in 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the *Manchester computers* and became interested in mathematical biology.

Turing's "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" is an article that the English mathematician Alan Turing wrote in 1952. It describes how patterns in nature, such as stripes and spirals, can arise naturally from a homogeneous, uniform state. The theory, which can be called a reaction-diffusion theory of morphogenesis, has become a basic model in theoretical biology. Such patterns have come to be known as *Turing patterns*. This paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis has predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognised in Britain during his lifetime because much of his work (this time) was covered by the Official Secrets Act.

In `1951`, while living alone and secluded, Turing had a one-night stand with a young man who then broke into the Turing's flat and robbed him, thereby shaping the plot of the movie "Immitation Game" that continued to push the narriative in which Turing has singlehandedly invented the bombe, decrypted the Enigma, and pwned Germans, all by his lonesome. This event resulted in a police investigation, the course of which changed from finding the robber to investigating Turing's sexuality, and in `1952` Turing was found guilty of being gay ("decyphering while gay", at least "being robbed while gay").

The court gave Turing the "choice" between doing the time or scaring the gay away with DES (Diethylstilbestrol), a procedure known as chemical castration.

As an alternative to prison, Turing accepted the hormone treatment but this turned out to be a worse alternative. The treatment wracked his immune and hormonal system, induced depression, and overall had a highly negitive effect on Turing's psyche, intellect and creativity, eventually driving him to commit suicide.

`1953` saw Turing labelled as persona non grata with the state denying him security clearences and introducing restrictive measures against him. On June, 7th `1954`, Turing have commited suicide by ingesting poison (depicted in the play "Breaking the Code").

Twelve years too late, in `1966`, a new award for the important achievements in computer science was established, named *the Turing Award*. It has become the highest honor in the filed of computer science, equivalent to the Field's medal in mathematics and to the Noble prize in other (real) sciences.

On September, 10th `2009`, 55 years too late and as a result of a public campaign, the British government fronted by the prime minister Gordon Brown, apologized to the world for killing one of the greatest minds ever. (Had they took that opportunity to apologize for Britain's other transgressions that broadcast would still go on).

## Breaking the Enigma

Turing was certainly one of the key, if not the key person in this endeavour, but too many accounts of this story fail to mention anybody else, pushing the narrative that it was all Turing's effort - from devising the code-breaking facilitator machine, called the Bombe, to completely decyphering the Enigma-encoded messages. Contrary to the English propaganda, it took the combined effort of many deserving people to get the job done. English were quick to raise Turing to the stars, even proclaiming him as the sole actor in breaking the Enigma, but after the war, they were as quick to bring him down and out for being gay.

The effort to decrypt German messages started long before the war, and in 1931 the Polish mathematician and cryptologist *Marian Rejewski* was already on it. It was Rejewski who actually invented and constructed the first device known as *the bombe*, which he initially dubbed `"bomba kryptologiczna"` (cryptological bomb). In late `1932`, Rejewski managed to reconstruct an early version of the Enigma machine solely from the desciptions and the limited documentation obtained by the French military intelligence. Over the next 7 years, Rejewski and his fellow mathematicians, *Jerzy Różycki* and *Henryk Zygalski*, have developed the equipment and techniques to successfully decrypt German cryptograms, even as the Germans introduced modifications to their equipment and the encryption procedures. Five weeks before the outbreak of WW2, they shared their achievements with the French and British, thus enabling the British to decode German messages already in `1939`, some 7 years after Rejewski's original reconstruction of a German cyphering machine.

The intelligence gained by the British from these Enigma decrypts - under the umbrella of the operation codename "Ultra" - decisively contributed to the defeat of Germany. It was estimated that the breaking of the Enigma code had shortened the war by at least 2 years.

The bombe machines constructed at the Bletchley Park were based on Rejewski's work. The engineering and construction of the first bombe made at Bletchley Park was completed by *Harold Keen* of the British Tabulating Machine Company. That first version, code-named "Victory", was ready in March 1940. The second version of the bombe, code-name "Agnus Dei", was finished by the August 1940. This version contained a major impovement contributed by *Gordon Welchman*, a member of the decrypting team that was led by Turing.

Turing was at the Bletchley Park from 1939 to 1942. For a time there, he was the lead of the Hut 8, the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Turing had devised a number of techniques for speeding up the process of decrypting German ciphers, improving the Polish bomba. Bomba was an electromechanical device, invented by Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski, that could find settings for the Enigma machine.

The whole endeavour of breaking the Enigma, including Turing's contribution, were kept top secret for the next 50 years after. For his efforts, Turing was awarded a cure for gayness that destroyed him physiologically and led him to commit suicide in 1954. (No good deed, eh?).

Misc
- *The "Alan Turing law"* is an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The provision is named after Alan Turing, the World War II codebreaker and computing pioneer, who was convicted of gross indecency in 1952.
- *The Alan Turing Year*, 2012, marked the celebration of the life and scientific influence of Alan Turing during the centenary of his birth on 23 June 1912. The Alan Turing Centenary Advisory committee (TCAC) was originally set up by Professor Barry Cooper.

Books
- "Alan Turing: The Enigma" from 1983 is a Turing's biography by Andrew Hodges. The book covers Turing's life and work. The 2014 film "The Imitation Game" is loosely based on the book.
- "The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine" is a book by Charles Petzold, published in 2008 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Mathematics
- *Church-Turing thesis* conjectures about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method iff it is computable by a Turing machine.
- *Church-Turing-Deutsch principle* (CTD), in CS and quantum physics, is a stronger, physical form of the Church-Turing thesis formulated by David Deutsch in 1985. The principle states that a universal computing device can simulate every physical process.
- *Good-Turing frequency estimation* is a statistical technique for estimating the probability of encountering an object of a hitherto unseen species, given a set of past observations of objects from different species. In drawing balls from an urn, the 'objects' would be balls and the 'species' would be the distinct colors of the balls (finite but unknown in number).

- "Turing" is an object-oriented, high-level, general-purpose programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, at University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada, intended to help students learn how to code.

CS, Computation
- *Hypercomputation* or *super-Turing computation* 
  is a set of models of computation that can provide outputs that are not Turing-computable. For example, a machine that could solve the halting problem would be a hypercomputer; so too would one that can correctly evaluate every statement in Peano arithmetic.

- *Turing-acceptable language*   
  In mathematics, logic and computer science, a formal language is called recursively enumerable (also recognizable, partially decidable, semidecidable, *Turing-acceptable* or *Turing-recognizable*) if it is a recursively enumerable subset in the set of all possible words over the alphabet of the language, i.e. if there exists a Turing machine which will enumerate all valid strings of the language.
