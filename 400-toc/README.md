# Theory of Computation



The 3 major branches of Theory of Computation (ToC)
1. Automata Theory and Formal Language Theory
  - Automata Theory (DFA, NFA, RE, …)
  - Formal Languages (regular langs, grammar, semantics, …)
2. Computability Theory (ex Recursion Theory)
  - models of computation
  - recursion theory (theory of recursive functions, PRF, GRF, …)
3. Complexity Theory (aka Computational Complexity Theory)
  - time and space complexity
