# Admissible numbering

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_numbering

In computability theory, **admissible numberings** are enumerations (numberings) of the set of partial computable functions that can be converted to and from the standard numbering. These numberings are also called *acceptable numberings* and *acceptable programming systems*.

*Rogers' equivalence theorem* shows that all acceptable programming systems are equivalent to each other in the formal sense of numbering theory.
