# Applicative computing systems

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_computing_systems

**Applicative computing systems** (ACS) are the systems of object calculi founded on combinatory logic and lambda calculus.

The only essential notion which is under consideration in these systems is the representation of an object. 

In combinatory logic the only metaoperator is application in a sense of applying one object to other. 

In lambda calculus two metaoperators are used: application - the same as in combinatory logic, and functional abstraction which binds the only variable in one object.
