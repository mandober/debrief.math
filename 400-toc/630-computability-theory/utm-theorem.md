# UTM theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_theorem

In computability theory, the UTM theorem, or universal Turing machine theorem, is a basic result about Gödel numberings of the set of computable functions. It affirms the existence of a computable universal function, which is capable of calculating any other computable function.[1] The universal function is an abstract version of the universal Turing machine, thus the name of the theorem.

Roger's equivalence theorem provides a characterization of the Gödel numbering of the computable functions in terms of the Smn-theorem and the UTM theorem.

## Theorem

The theorem states that a partial computable function u of two variables exists such that, for every computable function f of one variable, an e exists such that `f(x) ≃ u(e,x)` for all x. This means that, for each x, either `f(x)` and `u(e,x)` are both defined and are equal, or are both undefined.[2]

The theorem thus shows that, defining `φₑ(x)` as `u(e, x)`, the sequence `φ1, φ2, …` is an enumeration of the partial computable functions. The function `u` in the statement of the theorem is called a universal function.
