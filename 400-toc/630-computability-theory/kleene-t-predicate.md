# Kleene's T predicate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_T_predicate

In computability theory, the **T predicate**, first studied by mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene, is a particular set of triples of natural numbers that is used to represent computable functions within formal theories of arithmetic.

Informally, the T predicate tells whether a particular computer program will halt when run with a particular input, and the corresponding `U` function is used to obtain the results of the computation if the program does halt. As with the *Smn theorem*, the original notation used by Kleene has become standard terminology for the concept.[1]
