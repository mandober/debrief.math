# Early history of recursive definitions

Examples of recursive definitions can be found intermittently in the history of ancient and medieval mathematics. A familiar illustration is the sequence of Fibonacci numbers.

The definition of this sequence has traditionally been attributed to the thirteenth century Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (also known as Fibonacci) who introduced it in his Liber Abaci in the context of an example involving population genetics, but descriptions of similar sequences can also be found in Greek, Egyptian, and Sanskrit sources dating as early as 700 BCE.

General interest in *recursion as a mode of function definition* originated in the mid-XIX century as part of the broader program of arithmetizing analysis and the ensuing discussions of the foundations of arithmetic itself.

In this context, the formulation of recursive definitions for number theoretic functions was closely tied to the isolation of *mathematical induction* as a mode of reasoning about the natural numbers.

It was in this setting in which Grassmann (1861) and Peirce (1881) first gave the familiar recursive definitions of addition and multiplication. They then used these definition to prove the associative, commutative, and distributive laws for these operations.

The first person to employ the expression *"definition by recursion"* appears to have been Dedekind in his essay "Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen", 1888.

This work presents a set theoretic foundation for arithmetic wherein Dedekind demonstrated that it was possible to state and prove the existence and uniqueness of functions defined by primitive recursion as mathematical theorems.

He formulated recursive definitions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation and then also formally proved by induction that the functions so defined satisfy the expected algebraic identities.

The first two of these definitions would later be adopted by Peano in 1889 as defining the symbols `+` and `Ã—` in the direct axiomatization of arithmetic he based on Dedekind's monograph.
