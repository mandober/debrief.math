## Finite-state automata
Finite-state automata (FSA) is a limited but still useful model of computation based on the transitions between states in response to an input. The topics of interest in FSA include DFA ≅ NFA, regexp, the Pumping Lemma.

## Kleene's star
The Kleene's star, `Σ⃰`, is an operator that applied to an alphabet (a finite set of characters) produces a set of all possible words over that alphabet. In regular languages and regular expressions it represents 0 or more repetitions of the previous character.

## Kleene's theorem
The Kleene's theorem states that finite automata (DFA, NFA) and regular expressions (regex) are equivalent in their expressiveness for denoting a regular language.

## Regular language
A regular language is a formal language consisting of a set of strings that can be recognized by one of these equivalent mathematical formalisms: finite automaton, regular grammar or regular expression.

## Regular expression
The concept of regular expressions was introduced by Kleene in 1951 via his definition of regular events. A regular expression is a symbolic expression, a translation of a finite automaton. The strict regex (language) consists only of literal characters (which are regexp), concatenation of regexps, alternation of regexps, and the use of Kleene's star on a regexp.
