https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical_computer_science

Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on mathematical aspects of computer science such as theory of computation, formal language theory, lambda calculus, type theory (fields shared with mathematics).

It is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The work in TCS is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.

TCS topics include:
- algorithms
- data structures
- computational complexity
- parallel and distributed computation
- probabilistic computation
- quantum computation
- automata theory
- information theory
- cryptography
- program semantics and verification
- algorithmic game theory
- machine learning
- computational biology
- computational economics
- computational geometry
- computational number theory
- computational algebra
