# Automata Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory

Automata theory (AT) is the study of *abstract machines* and *automata*, and of the *computational problems* that can be solved using them.

Automata theory defines various automata, each of which is a distinct model of computation. AT studies and classifies them by efficiency and computational power, although Theory of Computation, as its parent field, enumerates all the computation models spread out across mathematics (models of computation are mostly associated and described to ToC, particularly Automata theory, but some mathematical fields define their own models of computation, for example, logic and algebra have some).

Automata theory are Formal Language Theory are closely related, and are often considered together, as one field.

## Automata

An **automaton** is a machine designed to follow a predefined sequence of operations automatically. The term hails from Greek `αὐτόματα` (self-acting).

In automata theory and formal language theory, an automaton (which is singular form of the plural 'automata') is a finite representation of a formal, possibly infinite, language.

Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they recognize, typically illustrated by the *Chomsky hierarchy*, which describes the relations between various languages and kinds of formalized logic.

Automata plays a major role in theory of computation, compiler theory, parsing theory, formal verification, artificial intelligence.
