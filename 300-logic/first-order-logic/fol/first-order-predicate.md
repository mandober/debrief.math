# First-order predicate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_predicate

A **first-order predicate** is a predicate that takes only individual constants or variables as arguments.

- Constants are specific individuals in the domain of discourse (DOD). 
- Variables range over the DOD.
- Functions yield elements of the DOD.
- Predicates form propositions which have a truth value.

In set theory (where there is nothing but sets), a first-order predicate ranges over sets, a second-order predicate ranges over sets of sets, a third-order predicate ranges over sets of sets of sets, etc.

In a first-order language, variables can range only over individuals and not sets of individuals; specifically, variables cannot range over predicates. In higher-order languages, variables can range over anything; functions are predicates can take anything as arguments.
