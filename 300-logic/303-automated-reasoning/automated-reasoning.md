# Automated reasoning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning

In CS, particularly in the area of knowledge representation and reasoning, and in metalogic, automated reasoning is dedicated to understanding different aspects of reasoning. Although automated reasoning is considered a sub-field of artificial intelligence, it has connections with theoretical CS and philosophy.

The study of automated reasoning helps produce computer programs that allow computers to reason completely, or nearly completely, automatically.

- Automated Theorem Proving: subfield of automated reasoning and math logic
- Computer-assisted proof: math proof at least partially generated by computer
- Formal Verification: dis/proving the correctness of certain algorithms
- Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT, SAT): logical problem studied in CS
- Metamath: formal language and associated computer program
- QED manifesto: proposal for a computer-based DB of mathematical knowledge


The most developed areas of automated reasoning are *automated theorem proving*, and less automated but more pragmatic subfield of *interactive theorem proving*, and *automated proof checking* (viewed as guaranteed correct reasoning under fixed assumptions). Extensive work has also been done in reasoning by analogy using induction and abduction.
