# Basic concepts in logic

## Argument

Logic studies **arguments**, which are *instances of reasoning* in which one or more statements, known as *premises*, are presented as justifications (support, grounds, reasons, evidence) for the final statement, known as *conclusion*. 

Arguments relay our reasoning and the claims to truth. It is tempting to define argument as a procedure that establishes the truth of the conclusion, but it is not so. An argument only establishes the truth of the conclusion relative to a set of premises and admitted rules of inference.

Logicians don't care whether an argument succeeds psychologically, as a way to win a debate, change someone's mind, or convince them of something - the effectiveness of reasoning in persuading and influencing others is studied in *rhetoric*, while *psychology* studies the actual process of human reasoning. On the other hand, logic studies the correctness of reasoning in terms of the validity of inference.

To assess its worth, only two aspects of an argument are considered:
- the truth value of premises
- the validity of reasoning as the conclusion is derived from premises

Of these two, logicians only study the reasoning process, leaving the actual truth of the premises to empirical science.

A **valid argument**
- if the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion
- if the conclusion is necessarily true provided the premises are true
- if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false and yet the premises to be true at the same time
- if the conclusion can be deduced from the premises according to a set of inference rules

All these formulations of validity are equivalent. The last formulation is about syntactic validity, while the others are about semantic validity. If an argument is not valid, it is called invalid.

* Only arguments are valid or invalid, not statements.
* Validity pertains to reasoning, not propositions.

* Only statements have a truth value, not arguments.
* Truth pertains to propositions, not reasoning.

The first fundamental principle of logic is the *independence of truth and validity*.

A valid argument whose premises are true is a **sound argument**. Otherwise it is unsound. If an argument is sound, then its conclusion must be true (and it would be illogical to reject it).

A **deductive argument** gives conclusive grounds for the truth of the conclusion - its premises support the conclusion with necessity.

An **inductive argument** makes a milder claim - its premises support, but do not guarantee, the conclusion.

Validity applies only to deductive arguments, while inductive arguments are classified as strong and weak.

In a valid deductive argument with all true premises, the truth of the conclusion is necessary and the falsehood is impossible.

In a strong inductive argument with all true premises, the truth of the conclusion is merely probable and the falsehood merely improbable.

The kind of support that valid deductions provide their conclusions is not a matter of degree (but the case of "all or nothing") - a conclusion is either entirely true of false. On the other hand, the kind of support that strong inductions provide their conclusions is a matter of degree (it's a case of "more-less").

A conclusion of a valid deduction never contains more information than the premises contained, while a conclusion of an induction always does. This explains why deductions possess certainty (they never tell us anything new) and why inductions are always uncertain to some degree.

The difference between inductions and bad deductions should not be confused. That difference is not the same as the difference between good and bad reasoning, but it is the difference between two ways to support the truth of conclusions. Deduction undergoes the rigorous mathematical argumentation, while induction does not.

A *fallacy* is a bad method of argument, whether deductive or inductive. Arguments can be "bad" (or unsound) for several reasons: one or more of their premises may be false, or irrelevant, or the reasoning from them may be invalid, or the language expressing them may be ambiguous or vague. There are certainly an infinity of bad arguments; there may even be an infinity of ways of arguing badly. The name fallacy is usually reserved for typical faults in arguments that have been thoroughly classified.
