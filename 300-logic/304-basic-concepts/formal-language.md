# Formal language

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language

In logic, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics, a **formal language** consists of words, whose letters are taken from an alphabet, and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules of the formal grammar.

The *alphabet* of a formal language consists of *symbols* (letters, tokens) that concatenate into strings of the language. Each *string* concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a *word*, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are called *well-formed formulas*.

A formal language is often defined by means of a *formal grammar*, such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, which prescibes the *formation rules*.

The field of *formal language theory* studies primarily the *purely syntactical aspects* of such languages, that is, their *internal structural patterns*. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of natural languages.

In computer science, formal languages are used as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages, as well as formalized versions (of subsets) of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or semantics.

In computational complexity theory, *decision problems* are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power.

In logic and the foundations of mathematics, formal languages are used to represent the *syntax of axiomatic systems*. *Mathematical formalism* (logicism)is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.
