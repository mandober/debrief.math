[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Formal_languages.svg/300px-Formal_languages.svg.png)][1]

In [logic][2], __syntax__ is anything having to do with [formal languages][3] or [formal systems][4] without regard to any [interpretation][5] or [meaning][6] given to them. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the [semantics][7] of a language which is concerned with its meaning.

The [symbols][8], [formulas][9], [systems][10], [theorems][11], [proofs][12], and [interpretations][13] expressed in formal languages are syntactic entities whose properties may be studied without regard to any meaning they may be given, and, in fact, need not be given any.

Syntax is usually associated with the rules (or grammar) governing the composition of texts in a formal language that constitute the [well-formed formulas][14] of a formal system.

In [computer science][15], the term *[syntax][16]* refers to the rules governing the composition of well-formed [expressions][17] in a [programming language][18]. As in mathematical logic, it is independent of semantics and interpretation.

## Syntactic entities\[[edit][19]\]

### Symbols\[[edit][20]\]

A symbol is an [idea][21], [abstraction][22] or [concept][23], [tokens][24] of which may be marks or a metalanguage of marks which form a particular pattern. Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance there are [logical constants][25] which do not refer to any idea, but rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if the formulation is consistent with the formation rules of the language. Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any interpretation of them.

### Formal language\[[edit][26]\]

A *formal language* is a syntactic entity which consists of a [set][27] of finite [strings][28] of [symbols][29] which are its words (usually called its [well-formed formulas][30]). Which strings of symbols are words is determined by the creator of the language, usually by specifying a set of [formation rules][31]. Such a language can be defined without [reference][32] to any [meanings][33] of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [interpretation][34] is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning.

### Formation rules\[[edit][35]\]

*Formation rules* are a precise description of which [strings][36] of [symbols][37] are the [well-formed formulas][38] of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of [strings][39] over the [alphabet][40] of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their [semantics][41] (i.e. what they mean).

### Propositions\[[edit][42]\]

A __proposition__ is a [sentence][43] expressing something [true][44] or [false][45]. A proposition is identified [ontologically][46] as an [idea][47], [concept][48] or [abstraction][49] whose [token instances][50] are patterns of [symbols][51], marks, sounds, or [strings][52] of words.[\[2\]][53] Propositions are considered to be syntactic entities and also [truthbearers][54].

### Formal theories\[[edit][55]\]

A __formal theory__ is a [set][56] of [sentences][57] in a [formal language][58].

### Formal systems\[[edit][59]\]

A *formal system* (also called a *logical calculus*, or a *logical system*) consists of a formal language together with a [deductive apparatus][60] (also called a *deductive system*). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [transformation rules][61] (also called *inference rules*) or a set of [axioms][62], or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. Formal systems, like other syntactic entities may be defined without any [interpretation][63] given to it (as being, for instance, a system of arithmetic).

#### Syntactic consequence within a formal system\[[edit][64]\]

A formula A is a __syntactic consequence__[\[3\]][65][\[4\]][66][\[5\]][67][\[6\]][68] within some formal system ![{\mathcal  {FS}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab025245b89b5d8e91a0f027632b0c1764ab2a9f) of a set Г of formulas if there is a [derivation][69] in [formal system][70] ![{\mathcal  {FS}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ab025245b89b5d8e91a0f027632b0c1764ab2a9f) of A from the set Г.

![\Gamma \vdash _{{{\mathrm  F}S}}A](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/569187e9a366de8468fefb5616f33f028548da6a)

Syntactic consequence does not depend on any [interpretation][71] of the formal system.[\[7\]][72]

#### Syntactic completeness of a formal system\[[edit][73]\]

A formal system ![{\mathcal  {S}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2302a18e269dbecc43c57c0c2aced3bfae15278d) is *syntactically complete*[\[8\]][74][\[9\]][75][\[10\]][76][\[11\]][77] (also *deductively complete*, *maximally complete*, *negation complete* or simply *complete*) iff for each formula A of the language of the system either A or ¬A is a theorem of ![{\mathcal  {S}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2302a18e269dbecc43c57c0c2aced3bfae15278d). In another sense, a formal system is syntactically complete iff no unprovable axiom can be added to it as an axiom without introducing an [inconsistency][78]. Truth-functional [propositional logic][79] and first-order [predicate logic][80] are semantically complete, but not syntactically complete (for example the propositional logic statement consisting of a single variable "a" is not a theorem, and neither is its negation, but these are not [tautologies][81]). [Gödel's incompleteness theorem][82] shows that no [recursive system][83] that is sufficiently powerful, such as the [Peano axioms][84], can be both consistent and complete.

### Interpretations\[[edit][85]\]

An *interpretation* of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and [truth values][86] to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called [formal semantics][87]. *Giving an interpretation* is synonymous with *constructing a [model][88]*. An interpretation is expressed in a [metalanguage][89], which may itself be a formal language, and as such itself is a syntactic entity.
