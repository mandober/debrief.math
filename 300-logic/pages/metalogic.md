# Metalogic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalogic

Metalogic is the study of the metatheory of logic. Whereas *logic* studies how logical systems can be used to construct valid and sound arguments, **metalogic** studies the properties of logical systems.

*Logic* concerns the truths that may be derived using a logical system; **metalogic** concerns the truths that may be derived about the languages and systems that are used to express truths.

The basic objects of metalogical study are formal languages, formal systems, and their *interpretations*. The study of interpretation of formal systems is done in *model theory*. The study of deductive systems is done in *proof theory*.
