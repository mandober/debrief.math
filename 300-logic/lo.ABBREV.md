# Logic: Abbreviations


## CL
Classical logic. AKA traditional logic, standard logic, term logic.

## CHI
Curry-Howard isomorphism (aka propositions as types, proofs as programs).

## FOL
First-order logic. Quantification is permitted over variables only.

## HOL
Higher-order logic. Quantification is permitted over other language entities besides variables; second-order logic allows quantification over predicates. Higher-order logics allow quantification over variables, predicates, functions, relations, then over the sets of these entities, then over the sets of sets of these entities, and so on.

## iff
Abbreviation of the phrase "if and only if". Usually, phrases from a natural language are translated into logical symbols, but this ackward expression is a rare example of a statement originating in a formal system (mathematical logic) being transplanted into a natural language. It was forced into English via this artificial phrase that is supposed to describe the logical biconditional connective, `⇔`, wich itself is an amalgam of the logical implication, `->` (making the "if" part), and its converse, `<-` (perhaps making the "and only if" part).

## IL
Intuitionistic logic.

## LNC
The law of non-contradiction, `¬(p ⋀ ¬p)`; it is logically equivalent to the LEM: `¬(p ⋀ ¬p) = ¬p ⋁ p = p -> p`.

## LEM
The law of excluded middle. `p ⋁ ¬p`. Admitted in classical logics, rejected in intuitionistic logics.

## QL
Since the abbreviation PL would be too ambiguous whether it refers to propositional or predicate logic, the abbreviation SL (sentential logic) is used for propositional logic, and QL (quantified logic) for predicate logic.

## PNF
Prenex normal form. A formula of the predicate calculus is in prenex normal form if it is written as a string of quantifiers and bound variables, called the prefix, followed by a quantifier-free part, called the matrix.

## POB
The principle of bivalence; a proposition has exactly one truth value, either true or false, not both and not neither.

## SL
Since the abbreviation PL would be too ambiguous whether it refers to propositional or predicate logic, the abbreviation SL (sentential logic) is used for propositional logic, and QL (quantified logic) for predicate logic.

## wff
Well-formed formula.
