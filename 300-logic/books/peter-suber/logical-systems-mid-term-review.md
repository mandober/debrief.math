# Peter Suber, "Logical Systems, Mid-Term Review"

Here I try to list all the important terms, distinctions, symbols, and results from the first half of the course.  It wouldn't help much as a study guide if I listed everything we covered.  You can get that by re-reading Hunter.  I've tried to limit the list to what's most important. Believe it or not, I've omitted a lot.
**Logical Systems  
Mid-Term Review**

[Peter Suber][1], [Philosophy Department][2], [Earlham College][3]

Here I try to list all the important terms, distinctions, symbols, and results from the first half of the course. It wouldn't help much as a study guide if I listed everything we covered. You can get that by re-reading Hunter. I've tried to limit the list to what's most important. Believe it or not, I've omitted a lot.

This list covers the introductory unit on infinite sets and the unit on the metatheory of truth-functional propositional logic (TFPL).

The topics are only roughly in the order in which we encountered them. I've adjusted this order when I thought it important to cluster related topics together. I've put in some blank lines to separate clusters from one another.

I believe that all the technical terms on this list are defined in my [glossary][4]. If any are not, please let me know and I'll revise the glossary.

For a review sheet for the second half of the course, on predicate logic, see the [final exam review][5].
