>     A wff whose negation is a theorem. (This is a new term not yet widely used; I include it here to help it catch on.) See [theorem][33].

>     **Arithmetic, formal system of**.
>     
>     A first-order theory with a finite alphabet, and only finitely long wffs which, on its intended interpretation (1) contains theorems that express truths of number theory, and (2) permits the construction of a term to denote any natural number. See [first-order theory][35].
>     
>     **Arithmetization**.
>     
>     A generalized form of Gödel numbering in which distinct numerals are assigned to distinct symbols in the alphabet of a formal language. As a result every wff of the language can be re-expressed as a numeral (concatenating all the numerals for its component symbols). When done well, there can easily be an effective method for translating wffs into numerals and *vice versa*. See [Gödel numbering][36].

>     **Associated propositional formula (APF)**.
>     
>     A wff A of propositional logic created from a wff B of predicate logic by (1) removing the quantifiers from B, and (2) replacing each predicate symbol (and its arguments) in B with a propositional symbol. Notation: Bprop = p.
>     
>     **Atom**.
>     
>     (1) In propositional logic, a simple proposition as opposed to a compound proposition or *molecule*. A wff without connectives. (2) In predicate logic, a wff without quantifiers or connectives.
>     
>     **Attribute**.
>     
>     A property of an object; also (at a different level) a monadic predicate symbolizing such a property. See [predicate logic][37]; [relation][38].

>     **Axioms**.
>     
>     Wffs that are stipulated as unproved premises for the proof of other wffs inside a formal system.-   **Axiom schema** (plural: schemata).
>         
>         A formula containing variables of the metalanguage which becomes an axiom when its variables are instantiated to wffs of the formal language.-   **Logical axiom**.
>             
>             An axiom that is a logically valid wff of the language of the system. See [logical validity][39].-   **Proper axiom**.
>                 
>                 An axiom that is not a logically valid wff of the language of the system (but is a closed wff).
>                 
>                 **Axiom of choice**.
>                 
>                 In set theory, a controversial axiom asserting that for a non-empty set A of non-empty disjoint sets, there is a set B with exactly one member from each of the disjoint sets comprising A. Sometimes the axiom is written so as to assert that there is a *function* for choosing the members of the disjoint sets comprising A that will become the members of B. Cantor's generalized continuum hypothesis implies the axiom of choice. Usually abbreviated to AC. Also called the multiplicative axiom. See [set theory][40].

>                         Originally and narrowly, the thesis that all intuitively effective methods are generally recursive (in the sense of this term used in recursive function theory). Due to Alonzo Church, 1935. Currently and more broadly, the thesis that all intuitively effective methods are captured in any one of several formalizations, including recursive function theory, Turing machines, Markov algorithms, the Lambda calculus, and so on. See [effective method][104]; [recursive function theory][105].

>                         
>                         A system with at least one closed term is closed iff At/x implies (x)Ax for each closed term t and each 1-wff A. (A 1-wff is a wff with exactly one free variable.) Informally, the system is closed if the fact that A is a theorem when its free variable is replaced with any closed term in the language implies the universal generalization (x)A. It follows from closure that every member of the domain is named by some closed term; hence the domain is countable. See [omega-completeness][106]; [term, closed][107]; [wff, open][108].

>                         In predicate logic, the binding of all free variables from a wff by placing them within the scope of suitable quantifiers. A closed wff is considered its own closure. The closure of a closure of a wff A is considered a closure of A. Notation: Ac (a closure of wff A). Closed wffs are also called *sentences*. See [bound variable][109]; [free variable][110]; [generalization][111]; [instantiation][112]; [wff][113].

>                         The complement of a set A is the set of elements that are not members of A. Notation: A with a single bar over the top, or -A, or A'.-   **Absolute complement of a set**.
>                             
>                             The set of all things whatsoever that are not members of the given set. Standard set theory does not recognize absolute complements. See Russell's paradox.-   **Relative complement of a set**.
>                                 
>                                 The set of all things that are not members of the given set, A, but that are members of some particular "background" set, B. This can be expressed through the notation for set difference: the relative complement of A *in B* or *relative to B* (A against the background of B) is the set {x : (x  B) · (x  A)}. The background set is sometimes called the universe or universe of discourse. Notation: B-A, or B\A. See [universe of discourse][114].

>                                 A proposition that is part of a compound proposition. A component may itself be compound. For example, p is a component in pq, and pq is a component in (pq)r.

>                                 One of the simple function-building operations of recursive function theory. Given the one-place functions f(x) and g(x), composition allows us to create function h thus: h(x) = f(g(x)). More generally, if f is an m-place, f(x1...xm), and there is a series of n-place functions g, g(x1...xn), then we can create the n-place function h by composition: h(x1...xn) = f(g(x1...xn),...,gm(x1...xn)). Also called substitution. See [recursive function theory][119].

The eighth requirement introduces an irreducibly intuitive element into the definition. Some add (9) when given a problem from outside the the class for which the method is effective, the method may halt or loop forever without halting, but must not return a value as if it were the answer to the problem.

More precisely, a set such that every one of its members has at least one counterpart in a certain sequence (though they may have more than one counterpart), and every term in the sequence has a counterpart in the set. The resulting sequence is called an enumeration of the set. The set {a, b, c} is enumerated by the sequence <a, b, c>, but also by the sequence <a, a, c, b>; it is not enumerated by the sequence <a, a, c, c>.-   **Effectively enumerable set**.

Aristotle held that all quantified propositions have existential import. The modern view, due to George Boole, is that existentially quantified statements do and that universally quantified statements do not. Hence in the modern view, (x)(Ax  Bx) ("All A's are B's") is non-committal on the existence of any A's; it may be true even for an interpretation whose domain contains no objects to instantiate x, or none that happen to be A's. By contrast, (x)(Ax&#183Bx) ("Some A's are B's") asserts the existence of at least one A, and it would be false for any interpretation whose domain contained no such values for x.

The following three are normally named after Gödel. When one hears simply "Gödel's theorem" it usually refers to the first incompleteness theorem.-   **Gödel's completeness theorem** (1930). First-order polyadic predicate logic is semantically complete, that is, all logically valid wffs are theorems.

Roughly, any consistent or omega-consistent formal system of arithmetic of "sufficient strength" is incomplete (negation incomplete and omega-incomplete). To be of sufficient strength, the system must (1) have decidable sets of wffs and proofs, and (2) represent every decidable set of natural numbers. See [arithmetic, formal systems of][305]; [representation of a set][306].

The consistency of a system of "sufficient strength" (same as for the first incompleteness theorem) is not provable in the system, unless the system is inconsistent. The second incompleteness theorem is a corollary of the first. See [Hilbert's program][307].

For example, "polysyllabic" and "English" are autological, while "monosyllabic" and "pulchritudinous" are heterological. Is "heterological" heterological? If it is, then it isn't; if it isn't, then it is. Grelling's paradox cannot be expressed in first-order predicate logic, and is difficult to prevent in higher-order predicate logics.

Hopes of accomplishing Hilbert's program were dashed by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem. See [Gödel's theorems][337]; [relative consistency proof][338].

Customarily symbolized by "=" and written in infix notation, "x=y". While all systems of polyadic predicate logic can express identity as easily as any other 2-adic relation, a system is said to be "with identity" iff it also contains axioms, axiom schemata, and/or rules of inference determining how "=" is to be used. Note that an axiom like "(x)(x=x)" or "(x)Ixx" is not logically valid because there are interpretations of "=" or "I" that do not take the meaning of identity.

Also the connective that denotes this function; also the compound proposition built from this connective. This truth function is rarely what implication or "if...then" means in English, but it captures the logical core of that usage and is truth-functional.

These assignments are made by the human logician and are not native to the symbols of the formal language. These assignments can be captured by a function f so that (for example) for a constant, f(c) = object d from domain D; for a proposition, f(p) = true; for a truth-function, f() = material implication; for a function, f(g) = squaring the successor; or for a predicate, f(P) = the set of purple things. In propositional logic, an interpretation is just such a function; in predicate logic, it is some set (the domain) together with such a function defined for members of that domain.-   **Cardinality of an interpretation**.

Or when their domains map onto one another in the sense that their elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence and they stand in the same relations. To define isomorphism more precisely, let us say that D and D' are the domains of the two models under comparison, that for every member d of D there is a counterpart d' of D' and *vice versa*, that every function f defined for D has a counterpart function f' defined for D' and *vice versa*, and that every predicate P defined for D has a counterpart predicate P' defined for D' and *vice versa*. Now the two models are isomorphic iff these three conditions are met: (1) D and D' can be put into one-to-one correspondence, (2) for all functions f and f', f(d1...dn) = dn+1 iff f'(d1'...dn') = dn+1' and (3) for all predicates P and P', Pd1...dn iff P'd1'...dn'.

"Every interpretation" here is understood to mean all, but only, those interpretations in which the connectives and/or quantifiers take their standard meanings. In truth-functional propositional logic, logically valid wffs are also called tautologies. In standard predicate logic, logical validity is limited to interpretions with non-empty domains. Logical validity is also called logical truth. See [k-validity][473]; [model][474]; [predicate logic][475]; [tautology][476]; [true for an interpretation][477]. Notation: A (A is a logically valid wff).

Roughly, in the basis the theorem is proved to hold for the "ancestor" case, and in the induction step it is proved to hold for all "descendant" cases.

Roughly, if we are given a computable function f(x,y), then we posit another function g which computes the least value of y (a natural number) such that f(x,y) = 0. We say that g is created from f by minimization. One way that g might work is to start from 0 and test every natural number in order, stopping at the first value which makes f(x,y) = 0. See [recursive function theory][514]. Also called µ (Greek letter *mu*).-   **Bounded minimization**.

We pick a bound z and try every value 0...z as the value of y; the first one to make f(x,y) = 0 is returned as the value of g; if none makes f(x,y) = 0, then g returns 0. Since g always returns a value, it is a total function; since z is always finite, g is computable.-   **Unbounded minimization**.

Think of g running on a computer; when it is unbounded, it will run forever with some inputs. It might test the values 0, 1, 2... in search of a value for y which will make f(x,y) = 0. But if there is no such y, and if no bound is put on the search, then the search will never halt.

If we are given the functions f(x) and g(x), then we can create a new function h(x) from f and g by primitive recursion thus: when x = 0, then h(x) = f(x); but when x > 0, then h(x) = g(h(x-1)). (For rigor, the minus sign in the last expression should be replaced by another function, but I leave it this way for informal clarity.) Not to be mistaken for "primitive recursive functions".

A wff of predicate logic with at least one free variable. An open wff. A propositional function becomes a proposition when it is closed; it is closed either by generalization or instantiation, that is, either by binding free variables or replacing them with constants.

The quantifier applies to, or *binds*, variables which stand as the arguments of predicates. In first-order logic these variables must range over individuals; in higher-order logics they may range over predicates.

If we pick the initial functions and building operations so as to capture what we take to be all the intuitively computable functions, then we generate a set with the same extension as the set of Turing-computable functions. (This led Church to conjecture that all intuitively computable functions or effective methods are recursive functions.) Recursive function theory studies these functions, their method of generation, ways to prove that some functions are not recursive in this sense, and related matters.

Functions from sequences of theorems to theorems. In a formal system they should be formal (that is, syntactical or typographical) in nature, and work without reference to the meanings of the strings they manipulate. Also called rules of transformation, rules of production. See for example [modus ponens][758] and [modus tollens][759].

Is S a member of itself? If it is, then it is not; and if not, then it is. This contradiction infects set theory when it is permissible to speak of "all sets" or set complements without qualification, or when a set is defined loosely as any collection of any elements, or when every predicate (intension) determines a set (extension).

(2) In predicate logic, a wff A is satisfied iff there is a sequence of objects from the domain of some interpretation such that A is true for that sequence. What it means for a wff to be true for a sequence is [defined differently][787] for several distinct kinds of predicate logic wff, e.g. quantified wffs, atomic wffs, wffs compounded with the various connectives of the language, and naked propositional symbols. Among atomic wffs, satisfaction is defined differently depending on whether the arguments of the predicate are constants, variables, or functions, and in the last case, whether the arguments of the functions are constants, variables, or functions. Hence the concept of satisfaction cannot be made more precise without giving each of perhaps a dozen precise tests for different kinds of wff. See [truth for an interpretation][788].-   **Satisfiability**.

The intuitive notion of a set leads to paradoxes, and there is considerable mathematical and philosophical disagreement on how best to refine the intuitive notion. In a set, the order of members is irrelevant, and repetition of members is not meaningful. Notation: curly braces, {...}.

Does LST mean that the real numbers have the same cardinality as the natural numbers? Does it mean that the difference between the real numbers and the natural numbers that explains the greater cardinality of the reals cannot in principle be described or proved? Does it mean that no set is "absolutely" uncountable but only "relatively" to a given set of axioms and a given interpretation? See [Löwenheim-Skolem theorem][829]; [model theory][830].

Cantor's theorem (that the power set of a given set has a greater cardinality than the given set) implies that there is no largest set or all-inclusive set, at least if every set has a power set. Hence as "the set of all things", the universal set is not recognized in standard set theory. Sometimes the set of all things under consideration in the context; the universe of discourse. The complement of the null set. Notation: 1 (numeral one), or V. See [complement][925]; [power set][926]; [universe of discourse][927].

See [free variables][994]; [propositional function][995]. Some logicians use the terms, 1-wff, 2-wff,...n-wff for open wffs with 1 free variable, 2 free variables, ...n free variables. (Others call these 1-formula, 2-formula,...n-formula.)
