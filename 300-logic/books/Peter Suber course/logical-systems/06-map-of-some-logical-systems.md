**Map of Some Logical Systems**

[Peter Suber][1], [Philosophy Department][2], [Earlham College][3]

**D. Higher order logics**  
not (generally) consistent

  

The purpose of this map is to show that these important systems of logic are related by subsumption, and that to "climb" to the next higher, more encompassing system, one must sacrifice some important metalogical properties.

In climbing from A to B, one gives up syntactic completeness and truth-functionality. In climbing from B to C, one gives up decidability; note that one must climb at least this high to have a "respectable" system of arithmetic. In climbing from C to D, one (generally) gives up consistency.
