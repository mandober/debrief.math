**Guide to Philosophy on the Internet**

[Peter Suber][1], [Philosophy Department][2], [Earlham College][3]

  

> The [Hippias][4] search engine covers all the sites to which I link in this guide, plus many more, and only sites in philosophy. Unless you want to browse, then, you needn't wait for my entire page to load. Just run a Hippias search now.
> 
> If you would like to link to Hippias, or include a Hippias search box at your site, [see these details][5].

> [Hippias][6] is in the process of merging with Noesis. We expect that the merge will be complete by September 2000. When the merge is complete, the new service will be called Noesis, links to Hippias will take you to Noesis, Hippias searches from remote pages will run on Noesis, and submissions will be regarded as if intended for Noesis. Noesis was thoroughly overhauled in December 1999, and is being thoroughly overhauled again right now. During the merge Noesis will be greatly enhanced with new content and features.
> 
> This guide is also in the process of merging with Noesis.
> 
> If you would like to link to Noesis, or include a Noesis search box at your site, [see these details][7].

> -   This the **single-file edition** of the guide. It is large and loads slowly, but once loaded is easy to browse and search.
> -   The guide is also available in a [multiple-file edition][8], whose sections load more quickly. [Details][9].
