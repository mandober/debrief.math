Map of logic
- the most basic concept of logic
- related concept and aspects and entities
- properties of entities
- recognize common laws and principles
- aims of logic
- forking factors
- classification of logics 


This section tries to map the field of logic by exploring the basic concepts of logic, their properties, laws and principles; the aims of logic; the forking factors that have contributed in spitting, the once unitary science, into a multitude of logics known today.

In trying to get a hold on the origins of logic, we identify **reasoning** as the central notion from which logic has developed. Reasoning is a part of cognition… (cease and desist; leave cognition, thinking, perception and other mental processes to psychology - see section 'psychology' - lest fall down yet another rabbit hole).

Philosophy is interested in cognition and reasoning in general, and it has a dedicated field, logic, that studies reasoning in particular, and correct reasoning at that. Actually, logic is concerned with **logical reasoning**, which is a type of reasoning, that lets us derive new information from the existing knowledge, but in a manner that is supported by logic (in a manner that is consistant with logic).

with the correct inference we use to derive new facts from the existing knowlegde. Among its aims is to *codify* the correct way of reasoning and to make it *mechanizable*. To that aim, logic starts with reasoning, distiguishing logical reasoning within general reasoning, and tries to identify the *fundamental laws and principles* that govern it.


Logical reasoning happens in the form of an *argument*, which is a collection of claims called *propositions*. An argument is a *logical form* in which logical reasoning takes place. An argument consists of two types of propositions: *premises* which serve to give support (evidence, justification, reason, grounds) for the final claim called *conclusion*. Logic studies the correct way in which this process - of going from the premises to a conclusion - is performed. This process is called *derivation*, but also *inference* or *argumentation*.



Logic has further identified the 3 main ways of logical reasoning: abduction, induction and deduction.

- cognition › reasoning › logical reasoning
  - reasoning: deriving new from the existing information
    - logical reasoning: reasoning as supported by logic
- logical reasoning: deductive • non-deductive (inductive • abductive)
  - deduction: absolute truth of conclusions • necessary truth
    - mathematical reasoning • a priori • analytic • necessity
  - induction: probable truth of conclusions • possible truth • contingency
    - scientific method • a posteriori • synthetic
  - abduction: truth to the best explanation
    - employed by detectives and PI's • Sherlock Holmes • Hercule Poirot



1) logical form: argument
      ↓ argument
        composition of an argument:
          premises
          conclusion
        type of argument's sentences:
          declarative sentences
          propositions
          statement
    2) *types of logical reasoning*
      (according to the **certainty of the conclusion**)
      - deductive
        - validity
        - soundness
        - neccessary truth
        - syllogisms
      - inductive
        - cogency
        - possible truth
      - abductive
        - possible truth
        - best explanation
    3) *formality*
      - formal logic
        form
        symbolic
        purely syntactic
      - formal logic
        content
        fallices
    4) *truth values*
      - neccessary truth
      - possible truth
      - bivalent
      - two-valued
      - multi-valued
      - fuzzy logic
    5) *granularity* of objects
      - propositional
      - predicate
    6) *order*
      - fol
      - sol
      - hol
    7) *rules*
      - axioms
      - RoI
    8) *structure*
      - substructural
