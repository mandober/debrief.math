# Logic :: Fundamentals :: Reasoning :: DEFINITIONS

## Thinking
The term *thinking* refers to conscious *cognitive* processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation, unlike *perception*.


Their most paradigmatic forms are judging, reasoning, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory, or imagination, are also often included.

These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike perception. 

But when understood in the widest sense, any mental event may be understood as a form of thinking, including perception and unconscious mental processes. In a slightly different sense, the term thought refers not to the mental processes themselves but to mental states or systems of ideas brought about by these processes.

## Reasoning
Reasoning is a mental activity, a mental ability to introspect and reflect on oneself, to comprehend the world in which we live in, to form opinions and judgments. Reasoning is a part of thinking, but it is usually understood as capacity to comprehend new information.

human faculty of reason and rationality.

Reasoning is a congitive capacity, a mental activity through which we infer the things about ourselves, the world, and everything in between. 


In a more narrow and precise sense, reasoning is the ability to derive new information based on the existing facts.


*Reasoning* is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. 

## A priori, a posteriori

The terms *a priori* and *a posteriori* are used primarily to denote the foundations upon which a proposition is known.

A proposition that is knowable *a posteriori* is known on the basis of experience.

A proposition is knowable *a priori* if it can be known independent of experience (other than the experience of learning the language in which the proposition is expressed).

## Psychologism
