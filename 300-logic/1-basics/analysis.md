In face of overwhelming complexity examplified by a problem (system, object) too difficult and complicated to grasp directly, let alone comprehend, we do what we humans do best. First, we employ *analysis* (decomposition) we deconstruct the object into its constituent parts; we keep breaking it until the pieces become digestable. Then we study the shit out of them: their properties, inter-relations, inter-connections, interactions. It is bound that the whole mess initially looks disconnected, messy and vague; but we press on, and sooner or later, the *patterns* will start to emerge - cue *abstraction*. The process of abstraction moves from particulary to generality, from parts to a whole. We work from the low-level details toward the higher-level concepts: the knowledge extracted from atomic pieces is gathered to form understanding of how the pieces can be combined into the larger chunks.

We can test our comprehension of how the smallest of parts behave by putting forward predictions of how these pieces combined will behave. Once these predictions are sufficiently correct, we can actually or conceptually combine the pieces into the bigger chunks, reaching the first level of abstraction (new achievement unlocked).




We then keep on abstracting the pieces into the larger chunks, as we comprehend them more and more, until we are eventually able to recreate the original problem. This is *reductivism*, a view that we can understand a whole as the sum of its parts. It doesn't always apply or work, but it always pays to give it a go.

start with *analysis*, continuously use *abstraction* to work our way toward *synthesis*.

We do not reason from the facts alone. We draw conclusions about things based on our experience (a posteriori), intuition and intellect (a priori), but this process is affected by many factors.
