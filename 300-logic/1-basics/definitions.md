# Classification, Definitions, Propositions

## Classification

*Classification* is the process of grouping things together into classes based on their similarities. A *concept* is an idea that represents such a class. The concepts involved in a system of classification are organized into *hierarchies of species and genuses*. Every concept is *abstract* to some degree; a genus is more abstract than its species. When we subdivide a genus into species, we should use the *consistent principle*, so that the species are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. We should also use *essential attributes*, so that the members of each species are fundamentally alike and fundamentally different from members of other species. When we learn a new set of concepts, we need to identify genus-species relationships among the concepts. Concepts at the same level of abstractness should be placed at the same level in the hierarchy.

- Classify: to group things into species and genuses according to their similarities and differences.
- Referents: the class of things for which a concept stands.
- Genus: a class of things regarded as having various subcategories (its species).
- Species: a class of things regarded as a subcategory of a wider class (a genus).
- Mutually exclusive: in a classification, the property that each species excludes the members of every other species.
- Jointly exhaustive: in a classification, the property that the species taken together cover all the objects in the genus.

## Definitions

The function of a definition is to identify the referents of the concept, condense the knowledge we have about the referents, and relate the concept to
other concepts. A definition should mention the genus to which the concept belongs and the essential attributes (the differentia) distinguishing the referents of the concept from those of other species in the same genus. A definition should be neither too broad nor too narrow. It should not be circular, or use negative terms unnecessarily, or use language
that is unclear. In constructing a definition, we should find the genus first, then look for a differentia that isolates the right class of referents and names their essential attributes, and finally double-check the result by looking for counterexamples and checking against the other rules.

- Definition: a statement that identifies the referents of a concept by specifying the genus they belong to and the essential characteristics (differentia) that distinguish those referents from other members of the genus.
- Genus: a class of things regarded as having various subcategories (its species).
- Differentia: the element in a definition that specifies the attribute(s) distinguishing a species from other species of the same genus.
- Counterexample: a specific instance that proves a definition wrong.
- Stipulative definition: a stipulative definition introduces a new concept (or a new meaning for an existing concept) by specifying the criteria for inclusion in the concept.

## Propositions

Examples of statements:
1. Most cars have four wheels.
2. The Empire State Building is over 1,000 feet tall.
3. Jack is a Baptist.
4. The theory of relativity in physics has been well confirmed by experiments.

Each of these statements has a linguistic form as an English sentence. And each of the sentences has a meaning - it expresses a thought. The meaning or thought is a proposition. When we engage in reasoning, the units of thought are propositions.

When we weigh the evidence for and against a conclusion, we use the principles of logic that allow us to recognize relations among propositions and to identify the correct ones.

A proposition is a complete thought, normally expressed as a complete declarative sentence. Both the proposition and the sentence have the same truth value.

The proposition in the example (1) refers the concept of a car, which designates a particular class of things, but the proposition does more - it says something about the entire class, which may be evaluated as being either true or false. The phrase "the Empire State Building" in (2) names the particular building in New York City, while the whole proposition makes a definite statement (about it).

In clasical reasoning, which is the prevalent school of thought, all propositions have exactly one of the two truth values - each proposition is either true or false, not both nor neither (it's not always so in other logics).

Propositions, or more precisely the sentences that express them, usually have a paraticular form - they have a subject and a predicate (and an object). The subject refers to an entire class or only to some of its members, and the predicate says denotes what the subject is or does. Linguistically, this form can be stretched thin (think of newspaper titles), but it is important in syllogistic logic - we need the subject-predicate sentences to be complete in order to represent them properly in a syllogism.

Two different sentences may express the same proposition, just as two different words may express the same concept. And a single sentence may express more than one proposition. 

### Propositions and Word Meaning

Suppose we have two sentences that differ only in one word: "Jack is an X" and "Jack is a Y". If X and Y express the same concept, then these two sentences assert the same proposition; if the words express different concepts, then the sentences assert different propositions.

The tricky cases are those in which the words are related but not identical in meaning:
- (1) Jack is a Baptist.
- (2) Jack is a Christian.

Baptists are one denomination of Christians, so the propositions are related. If (1) is true, then (2) must also be true. But "Christian" is a more abstract concept than "Baptisats"; it also coveres other Christian denominations besides Baptists. So the sentences express different propositions, but have a *mereologic relation* that is expolred in syllogistic logic.

There is no single rule for determining whether two words express the same concept. We need to use our understanding of word meanings to ask whether the words pick out the same class of things; and, if so, whether they isolate those things on the basis of the same distinguishing properties. But it will help to consider two specific issues: word connotations and metaphors.

#### word connotations

Two words that express the same concept are usually synonymous, but sometimes these words have different connotations. They may convey different images or feelings; they elicit different associations in our minds; they express different attitudes.

- Mary *has firm command* of the subject matter.
- Mary *has a thorough understanding* of the subject matter.

These sentences assert the same proposition, because the italicized phrases express the same concept. But the first conveys the image of power and control over the material, whereas the second is more bland; it doesn't really convey any image at all. A good writer makes use of such differences in connotation to achieve a desired effect. But we shouldn't be misled by different connotations into thinking that different propositions have been asserted. This is especially important when the connotations involve strong positive or negative attitudes.



#### metaphors







### Summary

A proposition makes an assertion that is either true or false, and it is normally expressed in a declarative sentence containing a subject and a
predicate.

To identify the proposition asserted by a sentence, we must consider the meaning of each word that composes the sentence. In this context, two words are considered to have the same meaning if they express the *same concept*, even if they differ in connotation. And when a word or phrase is being used metaphorically, we must find a literal interpretation if we are to determine what proposition is being asserted. 

We must also consider *grammatical structure* when identifying propositions asserted by a sentence. It is possible to vary the grammatical structure of a sentence without changing the proposition it asserts. And grammatical devices such as *connectives*, *restrictive* and *non-restrictive clauses*, and *noun clauses* allow us to combine more than one proposition into a single complex sentence.

To identify the propositions a complex sentence asserts, we must break that sentence down into its components, and we must differentiate between those propositions the sentence asserts and those it merely expresses.

- Proposition: the meaning or content of a statement.
- Connective: a word that creates a compound proposition from component propositions.
