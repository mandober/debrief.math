# Logic :: Fundamentals :: 6. Argument

Logic strudies *correct logical reasoning*; it is interested in identifying and codyfing the correct ways of inference. *Inference* is the process of deriving new facts from the existing information, and *logical inference* is that same process but done in a way that is logical or supported by logic.

Famous valid deductive argument (syllogism):
- All men are mortal.              (major premise)
- Socrates is a man.               (minor premise)
- Therefore, Socrates is mortal.   (conclusion)

The *logical form* of correct reasoining is called an argument. An *argument* consists of *propositions*, some of which are called *premises* and they offer support (justification, grounds, reasons, evidence) for the final proposition called a *concusion*. Propositions are *declarative sentences*, also called *statments*, and they differ from other kinds of sentences (interrogative, exclamative or imperative) by having a *truth value*. We can examine a proposition and assign it a truth value, i.e. we can say that is true or false.

Logic studies arguments and one of the central questions of logic is how to distiguish between *good arguments* and *bad arguments*.

According to the 3 main types of logical reasoning, an argument can be deductive, inductive and abductive. Logic is primarily interested in *deductive arguments* because deduction, unlike *non-deductive reasoning* methods of induction and abduction, deals with the necessary truth and it is the only *formalizable* method of reasoning.

1. An example of a valid deductive argument (syllogism)
- All philosophers have beards      (major premise)
- Socrates is a philosopher         (minor premise)
- Therefore, Socrates has a beard   (conclusion)

2. An example of an invalid deductive argument (syllogism)
- All philosophers have beards
- Socrates had a beard
- Therefore, Socrates was philosophers

3. An example of a valid deductive argument (syllogism)
- All great logicians went insane
- Russell kept his sanity
- Thus, Russell is not a great logician


Arguments of this form are called *syllogistic arguments* or a syllogisms. They are deductive arguments studied in the *syllogistic logic* or *Aristotelian logic*. A *syllogism* or a *triple* consists of two premises, *major premise* followed by a *minor premise*, and a single *conclusion*.



One of the things people noticed looking at syllogisms like these was that you could tell the difference between these valid and invalid arguments **just by their structure alone**. You don't need to know what the subject and predicates (terms, in syllogistic logic) mean - you can just distinguish a correct (valid) argument by its form.

1. a. A syllogistic argument in symbols
- All P's have B's
- Some S is P
- Thus, some S has B

Thid would be the symbolic form of the argument in the first example. Because syllogisms only have 4 forms, individuals are quantified by "some"




Propositions have a truth value - they may be true or false. Propositions consistute an argument, but *arguments do not have a truth value*. Arguments are not true or false - only propositions are. Arguments have other propoerties. Deductive arguments are valid or invalid, sound or unsound (as we'll see next). Inductive arguments are contingent or uncontingent, sound or unsound.

## Deductive argument



## Inductive argument



## Abductive argument



## Conductive argument

In a conductive argument, the premises are valid separately and thus favor the conclusion. They do not need to be interrelated or even linked to each other, so they are said to be *convergent*. In fact, even if one or more premises were removed, the degree of support offered by the remaining premises would remain the same.

The premises of a conductive argument may be true, false or *controversial*. In particular, conductive arguments may include *counter-premises* or negative factors that provide evidence against the conclusion. In these cases, to accept the conclusion of a conductive argument with these characteristics, it is necessary to evaluate how significant are the "pro" premises against the "con" premises.

A popular example of conductive arguments are the lists of pros and cons that are used to make a decision, i.e. establish a set of even opposing premises to reach the best conclusion.

Conductive arguments help develop critical thinking, since they make us evaluate each of the premises, forcing us to consider the weight, significance and truthfulness of each proposition, thus offering us a chance to think for ourselves and form an opinion that may or may not coincide with the conclusion.

Since conductive arguments can be valid or invalid, they are considered to be *non-conclusive* arguments.

Conductive arguments have been put forward as another type of non-deductive arguments. A **conductive argument** is an argument whose premises are *convergent*: each premise is counted separately in support of the conclusion. Even if one or more premises are removed from the argument, the degree of support offered by the remaining premises would stay the same.

An example of a conductive argument:
- It most likely won't rain tomorrow.
- The sky is red tonight.
- Also, the weather channel reported a 30% chance of rain for tomorrow.

The primary rationale for distinguishing conductive arguments from deductive and inductive ones is as follows:
- First, the premises of conductive arguments are always convergent, but the premises of deductive and inductive arguments are never convergent.
- Second, the evaluation of arguments with convergent premises requires not only that each premise be evaluated individually as support for the conclusion, but also the degree to which the premises support the conclusion collectively must be determined.

This second consideration mitigates against treating conductive arguments merely as a collection of subarguments, each of which is deductive or inductive.

The basic idea is that the support that the convergent premises taken together provide the conclusion must be considered in the evaluation of a conductive argument.

With respect to the above conductive argument, "the sky is red tonight" and "the weather channel reported a 30% chance of rain for tomorrow" are offered together as (convergent) reasons for the conclusion, "It most likely won't rain tomorrow".

Perhaps collectively, but not individually, these reasons make a case that it most likely won't rain tomorrow.

### Examples of Conductive Arguments

Example 1
- Los Angeles is a clean city
- Living in Los Angeles is not too expensive.
- I know some people who live in Los Angeles.
- There are good public transportation systems in Los Angeles.
- I will move to Los Angeles.

Example 2
- Counter-premise 1: Traveling by plane is physically exhausting.
- Counter-premise 2: Traveling by plane is relatively expensive.
- Counter-premise 3: Airports do not always send luggage correctly.
- Premise 1: Traveling by plane is fast.
- Premise 2: I'm very tired and I can sleep on the plane.
- Premise 3: The company I work for will pay me the expenses later.
- Conclusion: It's okay to travel to the conference by plane instead of going by train.

Example 3 (from the book: `A Practical Study of Argument`)
- Premise 1: She's always looking out for him.
- Premise 2: When he is not in the city, she is restless.
- Premise 3: Whenever you can, she will mention your name in a conversation.
- Premise 4: No man had occupied his attention in that way in the past.
- conclusion: She is in love with him.


## Conclusion

A group of propositions constitutes an argument only if some are offered as reasons for one of them. Two approaches to identifying the definitive characteristics of arguments are the *structural* and *pragmatic* approaches.

On both approaches, whether an act of offering reasons for a proposition `P` yields an argument depends on what the reasoner believes regarding both the truth of the reasons and the relationship between the reasons and `P`.

A typical use of an argument is to rationally persuade an audience of the truth of the conclusion. To be effective in realizing this aim, the reasoner must think that there is a real potential in the relevant context for the audience to be rationally persuaded of the conclusion by means of the offered premises.

What, exactly, this presupposes about the audience depends on what the argument is and the context in which it is given.

An argument may be classified as deductive, inductive, abductive and conductive.
Its classification into one of these categories is a prerequisite for its proper evaluation.
