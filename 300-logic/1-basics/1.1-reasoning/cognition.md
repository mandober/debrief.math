# Cognition

/math/logic/basics/reasoning/cognition

*Cognition* is a mental process of acquiring knowledge and understanding from experience and through the process of thinking.

Cognition encompasses all aspects of intellectual functions and processes:
- perception
- attention
- thought
- imagination
- intelligence
- formation of knowledge
- memory and working memory
- judgment and evaluation
- reasoning and computation
- problem solving and decision making
- comprehension and production of language

Cognitive processes use existing knowledge to discover new information.

Cognitive processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, psychology, philosophy, logic, and computer science.

These and other approaches to the analysis of cognition are synthesized in the developing field of *cognitive science*, a progressively autonomous academic discipline.

## Thought and thinking

In their most common sense, the terms *thought* and *thinking* refer to *conscious cognitive processes* that can happen independently of *sensory stimulation*.

Thinking incudes
- judging
- reasoning
- concept formation
- problem solving
- deliberation
- consideration of ideas
- memory
- imagination

Unlike *perception*, these processes happen internally independent of the sensory organs.

Understood in the widest sense, any mental event may constitute a form of thinking, including perception and *unconscious mental processes*.

In a slightly different sense, the term "thought" refers not to the mental processes themselves, but to *mental states*, or *systems of ideas*, brought about by these processes.

## Perception

*Perception* involves physical stimulations (visual, chemical, auditory, tactile, etc.) of the sensory system, which are converted into electrical signals that are relayed through the nervous system into the brain which then identifies, interprets and organizes the signals, converting them into usable information about the current situation and environment in general.

Perception is not just a passive reception of external stimuli, but it is shaped by the recipient's knowledge, memory, expectations, attention. Also, perception involves internal states like self-appropriation, proprioception, hunger, arousal, tiredness, sleepiness, etc.


Sensory input is a process that transforms this low-level information to higher-level information (e.g. extracts shapes for object recognition). The process that follows connects a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as attention) that influence perception.

Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside *conscious awareness*.

Although people traditionally viewed the senses as passive receptors, the study of illusions and ambiguous images has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and *pre-consciously* attempt to make sense of their input. There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hypothesis testing, analogous to science, or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.

The perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying.

The brain is structured in a modular way, with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of sensory maps, mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface. These different modules are interconnected and influence each other; e.g. taste is strongly influenced by smell.
