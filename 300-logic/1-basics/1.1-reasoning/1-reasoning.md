# Logic :: Part I :: Reasoning

**Perception** involves physical stimulations (visual, chemical, auditory, tactile, etc.) of the sensory system, which are converted into electrical signals that are relayed through the nervous system into the brain which then identifies, interprets and organizes the signals, converting them into usable information about the current situation and environment in general. Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems as an effortless process because it happens outside conscious awareness.

In their most common sense, the terms **thought** and **thinking** refer to conscious cognitive processes that can happen independently of sensory stimulation. Their most paradigmatic forms are reasoning, judging, concept formation, problem solving, and deliberation, but other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory or imagination, are also often included. Unlike perception, these mental processes happen internally independent of the senses.


**Reasoning** is a mental process of drawing new informatrion from existing knowledge, parts of which are used to provide the support (evidence, reasons, grounds, justification) for the inferred conclusion.

**Judgement** (judging) is a mental operation in which a proposition is evoked and then either affirmed or denied.

Both judging and reasoning depend on the possession of relevant concepts acquired during the process of *concept formation*.

**Problem solving** is a type of *thinking* that aims to reach a predefined goal by overcoming encountered obstacles.



**Reason** is the analytic faculty of the human mind that maintains objectivity during inspection and organization of perceptions.

Reason is the capacity to consciously apply logic by drawing conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth.





It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.


*Reasoning* is associated with the acts of thinking and cognition, and involves the use of one's intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments.

Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of *logical reasoning*, such as deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning.

Aristotle drew a distinction between *logical discursive reasoning* (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition-however valid-may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.

Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.

In contrast to the use of "reason" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.

Using reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, "morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason-that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing-while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does."

Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.
