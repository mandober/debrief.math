# Reasoning

/math/logic/basics/reasoning/reasoning

Reasoning is a cognitive process. **Reasoning** is the analytic faculty of the human mind that maintains objectivity during inspection and organization of perceptions.

Reasoning employs *analysis* and decomposition, *abstraction* and generalization, and *synthesis*, which along with rationality, objectivity and logic makes for a killer collection and the reasoning methodology we humans are famous for.

### Analysis

*Analysis* is the (cognitive) process of *decomposing* a complex topic into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it.

### Synthesis

The converse of analysis is *synthesis* - putting the pieces back together again in a new or different whole.

### Abstraction

In sciences, much of the emphasis is on *decomposing* systems to find their *underlying parts*, then trying to *analyze* these parts in as much detail as possible.

*Abstraction* involves *induction of ideas* or the *synthesis of particular facts* into one *general theory* about something.

*Abstraction* is the opposite of *specification*, which is the analysis (breaking-down) of a general idea or abstraction into *concrete facts*.

*Abstraction* can be seen as a *compression process* that maps multiple different pieces of *constituent data* to a single piece of *abstract data*, *based on similarities* in the constituent data. The process of abstraction entails the *identification of similarities* between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction.

Researchers in linguistics frequently apply abstraction so as to allow an analysis of the phenomena of language *at the desired level of detail*.

>*Abstraction in mathematics* is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept or object, removing any dependence on real-world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

In philosophical terminology, abstraction is the *thought process* wherein ideas are distanced from objects. But an idea can be symbolized. 
>Abstraction uses a strategy of *simplification*, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined.
Thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.

*Thinking in abstractions* is considered by anthropologists, archaeologists, and sociologists to be one of the key traits in modern human behaviour, which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. 
Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of *human language*, which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.

*Abstraction* is a *conceptual process* wherein *general rules and concepts* are derived from the use and **classification** of specific examples. 
*"An abstraction"* is the outcome of this process - a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts and connects any related concepts as category.

**Conceptual abstractions** may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept, selecting only those aspects which are relevant for a particular purpose.

In a *type-token distinction*, a type (e.g. "ball") is more abstract than its tokens (e.g. "that leather soccer ball").
