# Logic :: Fundamentals :: 2. Logical reasoning

## Logical reasoning

Reasoning, in general, is about acquiring information in order to form new knowledge. **Logical reasoning**, like the other types of reasoning, is about the same thing - deriving new information from the existing knowledge - but in a way that is rigorous, objective and, most of all, supported by logic.

>Logic is the study of correct logical reasoning.

Being supported by logic means that the reasoning is done in a manner consistant with logic (to be explained further), in a manner that is free of factors that affect human reasoning, such as emotions, circumstances, level of self-assurence, mood swings, goals, desires, and plenty of other, often utterly illogical, reasons. Some of these are known as *cognitive biases*, which along with *logical fallacies* and other afflictions that stem from the human condition, make correct reasoning a difficult task.

>Logic studies the correct ways of reasoning, attempting to identify, define, classify and, ultimatly, to codify them.

## Logical form and argument

To study logical reasoning, logic must first identify the correct *logical form* that the content subject to logical reasoning takes.

Reasoning is a mental process, but cognitive processes are left for other sciences, so logic models reasoning using the sentences of a natural language.

The content subject to logical reasoning is expressed using the sentences of a natural language, and this form is called an argument.

>An argument is the logical form that the content subject to logical reasoning takes.

However, an argument is an *abstract object of logic*. An argument may be expressed concretely using sentences of a natural language like English.

A piece of logical reasoning transcribed from the "language" of thoughts into plain English may look like:

>>Logical reasoning is a mental process, in which we derive new information from the existing knowledge, that takes the logical form called an argument. But in order to communicate an argument, we model it using a natural language like English, concretizing it as a set of sentences. Thus, an argument is a set of sentences expressed in a natural language (like English).

Logic evaluates passages like these, attempting to discern if they indeed constitute an argument (if they have the proper logical form), whether the argument is correct and whether the *conclusion* an argument makes is true. In fact, logic is more interested in *validity of an agument*, then whether it has a true conclusion. *Validity* is about determining whether the the conclusion actually follows from the premises. The *premises* are the sentences, that usually come before the conclusion, that express the support (reasons, justification, evidence, grounds) for the conclusion.



Logic then tries to identify an argument's components and properties.

## Types of logical reasoning

In analysing logical reasoning, different types of arguments have been identified. Aristotle wrote about deductive and inductive arguments, each pertaining to a certain type of logical reasoning. He held that deductive reasoning ruels because the truth of the conclusion is necessary, unlike inductive reasoning where the truth of the conclusion is only a possibility.

Logic distinguishes between different *types of logical reasoning* because, as it turns out, not all types are the same. The three main types of logical reasoning are *inductive*, *abductive* and *deductive* reasoning.

Another factor of division of logic is *formalism* that splits logic into *formal logic*, which is primarily interested in *logical form*, and *informal logic*, which studies the *content of reasoning*, especially with regards to logical fallicies.


## Non-triviality

In attempting to identify the correct manner of logical reasoning, the first principle we should abide to is *non-triviality*. We should approach the subject of logic like the programmers tasked to teach a computer to reason correctly, meaning there should be no pressumptions about what (information) is too familiar and obvious - everything must be explicitly stated.
Human communication is *context-dependent*, all natural languages are famously *ambiguous*, and many information in communication is left out, as it is considered to be the common knowledge.
In this scenario, we can either teach a computer about biases, fallacies, stereotypes, pressupositions, and the human condition in general, or we can forget all that and just require that everything is explicit and spelled out. This is just to suggest that correct reasoning is *difficult to analyze* within a natural language. 
Sometimes this is done for parsimony and practical reasons - there is a shared common klnowledge so there is no need to be explicit about everything. But this is also done for more nefarious reasons that rely on biases and prejudice. 
This is something that logical analysis of reasoning has to deal with, either correctly guessing what was left out or insisting that a piece of reasoning must always be complete and explicit in order to be suitable for analysis. (this, and more about *incorrect logical reasoning*, is explored further in the "argument" article).




## Descriptive and normative sciences

*Descriptive science* (biology, geography, etc) describe the encountered state of things and affairs, i.e. *how things are*. They are contrasted by *normative or prescriptive sciences*, which prescribe *how things ought to be*. Logic has aspects of both: it descibes reasoning, but also tries to prescribe the ways to reason correctly. Logical reasoning is *norm-governed* in the sense that it aims to formulate the correct ways of reasoning that any rational person would find convincing. Logic seeks to identify the *standards of correct reasoning*.


## Logical puzzle

To better understand what it means to reason in a logically correct way, consider this logial puzzle:

<!-- #region puzzle -->

- Keith is looking at Anita.
- Anita is looking at Brian.
- Keith is married.
- Brian is unmarried.

Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?
- Yes
- No
- Not enough information to decide

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

```hs
Keith ---------> Anita ---------> Brian
married          ?            unmarried
```

</details>

<br>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

By analysing Anita's relationship status, the answer comes out affirmative either way: if Anita is married, then a married person (Anita) is looking at an unmarried person (Brian). If Anita is unmarried, then a married person (Keith) is looking at an unmarried person (Anita).

The puzzle illustrates *the power of logic*: if people give the wrong answer, and then see the correct one and the reasoning behind it, they immediately change their minds and accept that it is correct and why it is so. Changing a person's mind generally doesn't happen that easy; people are very fond of their believes and find it very hard to let them go. Hell, we all even hold *contradictory believes* at the same time! (see, e.g. the preface paradox).

Since the scientific study of human reasoning began in the XX century, it was found again and again that we are not only bad at reasoning, but it seemed that we are almost programmed like that; like the flaws were intentional.
