## TL/DR

Differences between general reasoning and logical reasoning.

## Introduction

Any mathematical theory, or any self-contained body of knowledge in general, begins by first identifying the single, most essential notion that is central to its subject matter and from which it develops. The central notion of logic is that of *reasoning*, more precisely, of *logical reasoning*.

## Cognitive processes




*Reasoning* is the ability to understand, contemplate, introspect, form opinions and judgments through the process of *thinking*. It is a cognitive capacity, a mental activity through which we infer the things about ourselves, the world, and everything in between.

In a more narrow sense, reasoning is a cognitive processes in which the existing knowledge is used to *discover new information*.

An *inference* is the process of extracting new information from the existing knowledge. *Reasoning* is the process of making inferences, but automatically not intuitevely, but by examining the facts and seeing what conclusion they support. Some facts are percieved immediately as self-evident, and some can be inferred from the others. Describing the general form and rules of correct reasoning became the subject matter of logic.

Reasoning, and cognition in general, is a topic of interest to many sciences and specialized disciplines, including philosophy and psychology, with logic being specifically interested in logical reasoning.

*Logical reasoning*, like all types of reasoning, lets us acquire new information from the existing ones. However, unlike the other types of reasoning, logical reasoning derives new information from the existing knowledge in a way that is rigorous and supported by logic; in a manner that is consistant with logic; in a manner that is free of factors that affect human reasoning such as emotions, circumstances, self-assurence, mood swings, personal goals and desires, and other, often utterly illogical, reasons.

It is hard enough to reason correctly in face of *logical fallacies* let alone also having to deal with the afflictions that stem from the human condition, such as the *cognitive biases*.

## A logical puzzle

<!-- #region puzzle -->

To better undertand what it means to reason logically, consider this logical puzzle:

- Paul is looking at Mary.
- Mary is looking at Peter.
- Paul is married.
- Peter is unmarried.

**Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?**
- Yes
- No
- Not enough information to decide

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

```hs
Paul ---------> Mary ---------> Peter
married          ?            unmarried
```

</details>

<br>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

The answer is affirmative either way: if Mary is married, then a married person (Mary) is looking at an unmarried person (Peter). If Mary is unmarried, then a married person (Paul) is looking at an unmarried person (Mary).

This puzzle illustrates the power of logic: when people give the wrong answer, and then find out the correct one and the reasoning behind it, they immediately change their minds and accept it. Changing a person's mind generally does not happen that easy; people are very fond of their believes and find it hard to let them go. Hell, people even hold contradictory believes at the same time.

Since the scientific study of human reasoning began in the XX century, it was found again and again that we are not only bad at reasoning, but it seemed that we are almost programmed like that; like the flaws were intentional.

## Decision making and cognitive biases

There were experiments where you get to look at a set of pictures of people's faces, having to split the pictures in two piles - the people you'd prefer to work with and those you'd rather not. The conductor of the test then takes your preferred pile and secretely shoves in some pictures from your "undesirable" pile, while also removing some "preferables", and asks you to go over each picture to justify your decision. Almost nobody notices the incursion and happily proceeds to give justifications for their decisions.

This and many similar experiments involving decision-making have revealed that we seem practically built to give reasons for whatever we think we must, and not the reasons we actually used to reach a conclusion. The question then becomes do we actually use reasoning to form our beliefs? Disturbingly, it was revealed that instead of reasoning from a set of reasons to a conclusion, we also often start with the conclusion and invent the reasons for it.

## Social theory of reasoning

Reasoning in a proper way, from premises to a conclusion, demands a conscious effort, but reasoning in reverse, by inventing reasons on the spot, seems easy and automatic because it happens unconsciously. After decades of findings like this, Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber began to hypothesize that reasoning did not evolve to help us make better decisions, but instead to help us be social. Their *social theory of reasoning* also explains the existence of biases that otherwise make little sense. For example, when someone "does their own research" they often find things that support their original belief. This is called the *confirmation bias* - our tendency to seek, prefer, and interpret information so that it confirms what we already think.

Inventing reasons allows us to justify ourselves to others, but also to ourself (*rationalization*). It is hard to convince people of your agenda, but if you can muster compelling reasons to justify it, the chances of success are better. Persuading people into something or justifying yourself to them both work similarly - they start off weak and improve if others push it, always tailoring the efforts to the intended audience.
