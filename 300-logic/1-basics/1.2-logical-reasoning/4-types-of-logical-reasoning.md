# Logic :: Fundamentals :: 4. Types of logical reasoning

The deciding factor of the primary divison of logic into differnt types of logical reasoning is the *certainty of the conclusion* that an argument reaches.

Recognizing that logical reasoning does not establishes the same guarantees about the truth of their conclusion, Aristotle, who was the first person ever to study logic, divided logical reasoning into *deductive* and *inductive*, holding deduction as the superior method, while being dubious of the induction. Later on, *abductive* reasoning was recognized as another type of logical reasoning, even weaker than induction as to the certainty of the conclusions. Induction and abduction have forever been labelled as inferior, non-deductive types of reasoning.

>The three main types of logical reasoning are induction, abduction and deduction, which differ in the degree of certainty of their conclusions.

## Inductive reasoning

The most common way people reason about thing is **inductive reasoning**. By gathering empirical evidence about the various phenomena in the world and their outcomes, we start to gain confidence about the possible outcome the next time we witness the same phenomena. In time, we tend to *generalize* from all the individual encounters toward forming the knowledge about that phenomena. For example, always witnessing a black raven might incline you to believe that the next raven you see is black, and then to generalize that all ravens are black. Inductive reasoning thus makes general conclusions given many specific instances; it instills the belief that you can know or predict the future based on the past events. An inductive argument can only be *contigent*, never the necessaryt truth. Inducion has its problems, as indicated bu Hume under the name *problems of induction*. Nevertheless, inductive reasoning is the primary kind of reasoning used in science.

## Abductive reasoning

**Abductive reasoning** is usually understood as an *inference* based on an observation to a conclusion that best explains the observation. For example, inferring that it has rained after seeing that the streets are wet is an example. Abduction is often interpreted as the *inference to the best explanation*. This implies there are other possible explanations of the same phenomenon and that we should infer the best one. A tsunami could also explain why the streets are wet, but this is usually not the best explanation. Abductive reasoning is used by private detectives.

## Non-deductive reasoning

>Induction and abduction are non-deductive forms of reasoning, meaning that even if premises are true, they do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion, only that the conclusion is probable to some degree.

This division between non-deductive and deductive reasoning suggests that deduction is of the primary interest to logic - all systems of logic are deductive after all.
