# Logic :: Fundamentals :: 5. Deductive reasoning

**Deductive reasoning** offers the most guarantees about the certainty of the conclusion of its arguments - conclusions of deductive arguments are not only true, but they are *necessarily true*. This means they are true in all *possible worlds*, which is how the possibile states of the world are modelled.

Here's a classical deductive argument:
- All great logicians were institutionalized. 
- Russell managed to avoid asylum. 
- Russell was not a great logician. 


NOTE: **Modal logic** studies necessity and possibility (of truth) using the framework of **possible worlds**. Possible worlds can be understood as all conceivable states of the world - the actual state of the world, but also all its variations, however probable, as well as the variations of past events. This framework allows us to talk about *counterfactuals* - events that have already passed but which could have transpired some other way. Such events are modelled as *alternative worlds*, while the situation that actually happend is represented by the *current world*. The possible worlds are in relation to the current world: those worlds that significatnly differ from ours (e.g. have different laws of physics) are very far from ours, while those that only differ slightly are modelled as adjacent to ours.

Proposition like `2 + 2 = 4` is an example of the necessary truth that holds in all conceivable worlds. In fact, all mathematical truths are such truths, implying that mathematics exclusively uses deductive reasoning. *Necessary truth* of deduction is contrasted with *contigent truth* of induction, which in the possible worlds model means that it is true only in some, but not all, worlds.

>Deductive reasoning is the type of logical reasoning where the truth of premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

The degree of certainty of the conclusion in deduction is absolute; the certainty of the conclusion is guaranteed by the certainty of premises.

>It is impossible for a deductive conclusion to be false if the premises are true.

Aristotle recognized deduction as the only proper type of logical reasoning. He was aware of induction but he deemed it as an inferior type of reasoning that can be used until the same argument can be derived deductively (a failed expectation). Aristotle has codified deductive reasoning in his system of logic called **syllogistic logic** that rules logic all the way until XIX century, when it has fallen out of favor, being subsumed by propositional and predicate logic. A *syllogism* or a *triplet* is the form of a deductive argument that consists of two premises and a conclusion. A classical example of a deductive argument (a syllogism) is: "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal".

>In a deductive argument, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. If you accept the premises you must accept the conclusion; it would be illogical not to do so.

Now, where the premises of a deductiove argument actually come form and what guarantees their truth is another question. It is often the case that the premises are propositions resulting from inductive reasoing. In any case, you are free to refuse their truth, and thus the entire argument - but should you accept the premises, you are logically bound to accept the conclusion, that's all. In this regard, a deductive argument is like any mathematical theory: if you accept the axioms, you are guaranteed that what follows is true.

The relation between premises and the conclusion of an deductive argument is a *logical consequence* called **entailment**.

The entailment of deduction is explored in C. I. Caroll's story "What tortoise said to Achilles", where the tortoise maintains that it accepts the premises of a deductive argument that Achilles proposes, but that it does not accept the conclusion since it is "not as of yet" logically compeled to do so. This is utter bollocks - once you accept the premises you are illogical not to accept the conclusion, it's as simple as that. You are logically compeled to do so. The power of logic compels you! The power of logic compels you! The power of logic compels you! You'd have to be possessed to refuse the conclusion.

The essential property of deduction and the crucial reason why you are logically compelled to accept the conclusion once you accept the premises:

>No new knowledge is obtained from the conclusion of a deductive argument than what was already contained in the premises.

If you accept that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man, then you learn nothing new by accepting that Socrates is mortal.

By contrast, the conclusions of inductive arguments always provide new knowledge. However, this doesn't mean that deduction is futile because we do obtain new knowledge by accepting the premises. And once you accept premises, you're fresh out of reasonable objections not to accept the conclusion.

In a deductive argument, premises flow from more to less general ones, with the conclusion being a *less general* than the most general premise. This is contrasted with an inductive argument where the conclusion is *the most general statement* in the argument. In syllogistic arguments specifically (which are always deductive arguments), the major premise is the most general with a les general minor premise that bridges the two with the conclusion that is less or as general as the minor premise.

Deductive reasoning is definitely unique to humans, but what about induction? Many animals are capable of using reasoning to solve problems, but it seems a stretch to say they use induction or abduction; usually, it's a trial-and-error reasoning. Nevertheless it is incredibly facinating to watch crows use tools to solve complex setups to reach a treat. Once a crow learns which stick, length-wise, is the most suitable for a particualr task, it will pick that particular stick immediately when it encounters the same problem in the future. Can this fly as induction since it counts as learning from experience?

To avoid dealing with crows, deductive arguments are pretty much all that modern logic is concerned with. The two main properties of deductive arguments are *validity* and *soundness* (examined next).
