## Inference rules in logic systems

The inference rules of propositional logics involve the logical connectives relevant to these systems. The inference rules of predicate logics build up on the rules of propositional logics, and introduce new rules to deal with the thing by which they are distinguished, the quantification.

* Existential Generalization (EG)   φα/β ⊢ ∃αφ
* Existential Instantiation (EI)
* Universal Generalization (UG)
