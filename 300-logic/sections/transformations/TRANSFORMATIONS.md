# Transformations

* Transformation rules

* Types of transformations
  - equivalence rules
    - replace a wff with an equivalent wff (invertable)
    - logical equivalences
    - logical identities
  - introduction inference rules
    - apply an inference rules to wffs to get a new wff
    - assumption (relies on indentity rule that every wff is equal to itself)
  - elimination inference rules
    - apply an inference rules to wffs to get a new wff
    - modus ponens

* Transformation rules
  * Replacement rules
  - logical identity
  - application of a law or principle
  - application of an axiom

* Rules of replacement
  - logical equivalence
  - tautology
  - commutation
  - association
  - distribution
  - double negation
  - de Morgan's laws
  - transposition
  - material implication
  - exportation



  * Rules of inference
    - formation rules
    - introduction rules
    - elimination rules
    * Inferences
      - laws, principles, axioms, identities
