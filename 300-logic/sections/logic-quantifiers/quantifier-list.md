# Quantifier list


- ∀  universal quantifier
- ∃  existential quantifier
- λ  term-level abstraction, binder for term variables
- Λ  type-level abstraction, binder for type variables
- ∏  Π types, dependent product types binder
- ∑  Σ types, dependent sum types binder
- ∫ integral
- ∂ differential


## Highlights

- 1879 Frege uses a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates.
- 1885 Charles Sanders Peirce and Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal, `Πx`, and existential, `Σx`, quantifiers, and bound variables.
- 1897 G. Peano, symbol `∃`
- 1935 G. Gentzen, symbol `∀`; the symbol becomes canonical only in 1960s

## Summary

* Gottlob Frege, in his 1879 Begriffsschrift, was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates. He would *universally* quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. Frege did not devise an explicit notation for *existential quantification*, instead employing his equivalent of ~∀x~, or contraposition. Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until Bertrand Russell's 1903 Principles of Mathematics.
* In work that culminated in Peirce (1885), Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and bound variables. Peirce and Mitchell wrote `Πx` and `Σx` where we now write `∀x` and `∃x`. Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of Ernst Schröder, Leopold Loewenheim, Thoralf Skolem, and Polish logicians into the 1950s. Most notably, it is the notation of Kurt Gödel's landmark 1930 paper on the completeness of first-order logic, and 1931 paper on the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic.
* Peirce's approach to quantification also influenced Giuseppe Peano who invented yet another notation, namely (x) for the universal quantification of x and, in *1897*, `∃x` for the existential quantification of x.
* In *1935*, Gentzen introduced the ∀ symbol, by analogy with Peano's ∃ symbol.
* ∀ did not become canonical until the 1960s.
