# Term logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_logic

Term logic (traditional logic, syllogistic logic, Aristotelian logic) is a loose name for an approach to logic that began with Aristotle and was developed further in ancient history mostly by his followers, the peripatetics, but largely fell into decline by the third century CE. However, term logic was revived in medieval times, first in Islamic logic by Alpharabius in the X century, and later in Christian Europe in the XII century with the advent of *new logic*, remaining dominant until the advent of predicate logic in the late XIX century.

However, even if eclipsed by newer logical systems, term logic still plays a significant role in the study of logic. Rather then breaking with term logic, modern logic typically builds on it.

## Aristotle's system

Aristotle's logical work is collected in the 6 texts that are collectively known as the `Organon`. Two of these texts in particular, namely the `Prior Analytics` and `De Interpretatione`, contain the heart of Aristotle's treatment of judgements and formal inference, and it is principally this part of Aristotle's works that is about term logic.

Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Lukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. Lukasiewicz's approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley - which informs modern translations of "Prior Analytics" by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.
