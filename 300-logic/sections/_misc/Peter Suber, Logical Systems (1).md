*Syllabus*

The required reading for this courses consists of a few [web hand-outs][3] and the following books:

1.  Douglas R. Hofstadter, *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*, Basic Books, 20th anniversary edition, 1999.
2.  Geoffrey Hunter, *Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First Order Logic*, University of California Press, 1971.

Hunter is the main text. Hofstadter is for spice, motivation, illustration, application, and cogitation. We will read all of each of these two books, but only give page-by-page attention to Hunter. Our pace through Hunter may seem slow if you only consider the number of pages per night, or it may seem fast if you consider the density of the material. I hope I've hit it about right; if so, we can take most Fridays off and discuss Hofstadter.

I've written a large number of hand-outs to supplement Hunter. I used to distribute them as a mountain of photocopies. Now they're [on the web][4] with links to them from the appropriate spots in the [reading schedule below][5].

-   Most of the hand-outs were designed to clarify difficult points or expand on topics covered too briefly in Hunter. Hence they are recommended but not required. If any are required, I will say so in class.
-   Many of the pieces were written in response to student requests. I'm happy to write more. Let me know when you run across an especially difficult or fascinating topic on which I could write an additional hand-out.

Web access is required for this course.

I've created a course home-page containing a collection of hand-outs and course-related web links at [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/logsys/lshome.htm][6].

Pages will be discussed in class on the days for which they are listed. Pages in brackets are recommended but not required.

You must submit all assigned work to pass the course.

**Exams**

> Two of the four exams will be "office-door exams". This means that I will put the blank exams in the rack outside my office door by 9:00 AM on the exam day. You come by anytime during the day, take a copy, go to a private place, take the exam, and return it by 4:00 PM the same day. The advantage is that exams do not take up class time. I put (most of) them on Wednesdays so you will have a little more flexibility in when you can take them. Please follow these guidelines:
> 
> -   You are on your honor to work alone, and (if the exam instructions say so) to keep your books and notes closed. In this respect, office-door exams are no different from ordinary exams at Earlham, which are not proctored.
> -   I will design each ordinary exam to take 60 minutes and the final exam to take 120. But don't stop until you finish. If you don't finish in the allotted time, then draw a line across your page, label it ("60 minutes" or "time's up"), and keep writing. I'll decide later how much to count from below the line. This will help me design quizzes and exams that test your knowledge of the material rather than your speed.
> -   If you turn in your exam after I have left for the day, then push it under my door. (If you turn your exam after 4:00 PM, it is an NP.)
> -   Turn in the exam questions along with your answers, for security. I will return the question sheet as a study guide when I return your graded answers.
> 
> Missed quizzes and exams cannot be made up unless you have a medical or other substantial excuse for your absence.
> 
> None of the exams will cover my [hand-outs][75]. However, the exams will cover Hunter and my hand-outs are designed to help you with Hunter.
> 
> Please put your campus mailbox number on all your exams and submitted work. If you give me a self-addressed, stamped envelope for your final exam, then I'll mail your graded exam to you during the break.
> 
> If you want more feedback than the assigned work provides, do the [exercises in my hand-out][76]. Many of them are [answered][77] so that you can check your own progress.
> 
> If you want a quiz on Hunter's first section (on the infinite), I can give you one. You might want this to get feedback on your understanding or for some extra points in your final grade. I'll go with the consensus of the class on this. If you decide to have the quiz, it will cover the material up to Day 4. If you decide not to have the quiz, I may hand out the questions as a study guide.

**Formal system assignment**

> This assignment is fully described in a [separate hand-out][78].

The **core** of the formal system is due about three weeks before the system itself. The core may omit theorems, metatheorems, and proofs, but should include at least preliminary versions of the following:

-   the formal language (both alphabet and grammar)
-   the deductive apparatus (both axioms and rules of inference)
-   the intended interpretation.

> The system and its core are the only work for the course apart from exams and reading. I will accept rewrites of the formal system only if (1) the first edition comes in on time and (2) the first edition is a polished, finished paper, not a mere draft.
> 
> See my [generic hand-out][79] for details on [lateness][80] and [rewrites][81]. Here's the gist:  I apply a penalty to late work that arrives during the semester. I don't accept late work or rewrites after the last day of class.

**Format**

> I will assume that you have read and understood the day's reading. In my lectures I will sometimes focus on the most difficult points from the reading, sometimes the most important, and sometimes fine points most likely to be overlooked. Sometimes I will omit detail in order to give the big picture; sometimes I will ignore all but one sub-topic in order to delve more deeply into detail. There are two important consequences for you.
> 
> -   First, the lectures cannot convey everything that is important in the reading. Exams may legitimately cover everything in the assigned reading, even topics that never came up in lecture. But I promise you that exams will only cover what is most important in the reading. I won't try to trip you up on trivial details.
> -   Second, on some days you may have questions on parts of the text I did not cover in lecture. When this happens, please be sure to ask your questions. I am always willing to slow down, back up, or make mid-course corrections.
> 
> On most Fridays, a team of two or three of you will give a 15 minute presentation of material they found especially interesting or important from the reading in Hofstadter. In the remainder of the hour the team will lead a discussion on that material or on other interesting issues from Hofstadter. Any topics that arise from Hofstadter's book are fair game for a Friday discussion; they need not have any apparent connection to the logic in Hunter. Sign-up for a Friday slot as soon as you know your schedule. Slots will be allocated first-come, first-served.
> 
> I want each of you to lead a Hofstadter discussion at least twice. Depending on the enrollment, you may have to lead more than that.
> 
> For more information and some tips, see my [hand-out on giving presentations and leading discussion][82].

**Finding help**

If you need help, please don't hesitate to talk to me in my office. I can go over material again and give you one-on-one assistance. Here are some other possibilities:

-   Ask your questions in class. If you have questions, chances are that others do too. I'd like a chance to answer them for everyone, and to get the feedback on where questions are arising.
-   Send your question by email to the electronic discussion list for this course, **logsys** or **logsys@earlham.edu**. Give everyone a chance at it.
-   If you have a question that doesn't seem relevant to class, try it on me in my office or send it to me [by email][83].
-   Read my [hand-outs][84]. I wrote them to be helpful.
-   Use my [glossary][85]. Consider printing a copy to keep with your book.
-   Do my [exercises][86]. Some are answered in a [separate hand-out][87] (linked to the questions) to give you instant feedback. If you want to talk about the answers to the unanswered questions, raise them in class or drop by my office sometime.
-   If the material you're having trouble with is also discussed by Hofstadter, read his account. It's always easier than Hunter. For an index of the major topics in Hunter that are also covered in Hofstadter, see my [Hunter-Hofstadter map][88].
-   As the web expands, more and more of our material is covered somewhere on the web. Check my list of [course-related links][89] for possible leads. Sometimes another perspective helps. (The web is so large now that I can't hope to link to all relevant and worthy sites. So also check [Google][90].)
-   If you have not had [Symbolic Logic][91], then don't let my references to it intimidate you. Those are to help the students who have had the course. However, you might want to look at one or two of my [Symbolic Logic hand-outs][92] for review.
-   Conversely, if you have no [programming][93] background, then don't let my references to programming terms and concepts intimidate you. Those are to help the students who do have a programming background.

**A word on the hand-outs**

> Geoffrey Hunter and I planned to co-author a revised and expanded second edition of *Metalogic*. Most of the new material would consist of my [hand-outs][94]. In 1994 we had a contract with Macmillan and moved into the final stages of revision. Then Geoffrey had a serious setback in his health, requiring us to cancel the contract in 1995. Since the hand-outs work best when they presuppose Hunter's text, I did not try to revise them for separate publication. I'm happy to put them on the web where they can be used freely by anyone.

**Disabilities**

> Any student with a documented disability who wishes to arrange [reasonable accommodation][95] should talk to me and the Director of the [Center for Academic Enrichment][96] (Runyan basement, phone x.1341) as soon as possible and at least within the first two weeks of the semester.

This course is listed as Philosophy 43, Mathematics 43, and Computer Science 43. It satisfies requirements for the Computer Science major and minor. For that purpose, it shouldn't matter whether you signed up for it as a Philosophy course, a Mathematics course, or a CS course. If it does seems to matter to anyone, then please let me know.

This course does not satisfy any distribution requirement. It is simply for the glory of knowing.
