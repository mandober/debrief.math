**Guide to Philosophy on the Internet**

[Peter Suber][1], [Philosophy Department][2], [Earlham College][3]

  
  

I stopped updating this guide in February 2003, after eight years online. I plan to leave it online for the foreseeable future and hope that enough links are still alive to make it useful.

I know that the guide contains many dead links and omits many valuable new sites. For a comprehensive, well-organized, and up-to-date guide to philosophy on the internet, I can recommend Tom Stone's [EpistemeLinks][4].

> -   The guide is also available in a [multiple-file edition][5], whose sections load more quickly. [Details][6].

Welcome to my collection of online philosophy resources.

If you are stuck in a frame, [click here][27] to escape.

If you are a frequent visitor, press **reload** or **refresh** on occasion to be sure that you are viewing the most recent version of the page, not the version cached on your hard drive from your last visit.

I've marked recommended sites with a red star . Generally the starred sites are those I've found especially helpful for shortening the search for what one wants, as opposed to outstanding sites in themselves for which one ought to search. One day I may rate both. 

When the whole file loads, use the search command on your browser to find items by keyword.

To register to receive an email announcement whenever this page is revised, [see the bottom of this file][28].

If speed is a problem, try one of the mirror sites in [Germany][29] (München, single-file version) or [Italy][30] (Bari, single-file version), or [Italy][31] (Bari, multi-file version). The [original][32] is in Richmond, Indiana, U.S.A.

[About this guide][33]. Submitting a URL, scope, plans, notes, FAQ, awards. Also see my policy on [dead links][34].

[I welcome][35] URLs for inclusion, notice of broken links, and suggestions and comments of all kinds.

If you're interested in guides like this to disciplines other than philosophy, see [my list][36] of lists of them.

To catch users who type the incorrect URL, I have set up several aliases at my server. If you type **/peters/** (rather than **/~peters/**) or **/suber/** (rather than **/~peters/**), or **html** (rather than **htm**), then an alias will automatically redirect you to this page. But these URLs are incorrect and I cannot promise that the aliases correcting them will be supported forever. Please make sure that the link or bookmark that got you here has the correct URL:

**http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/philinks.htm**

If you link directly to one of my sections (such as [Associations][37] or [Journals][38]), and if you use one of the aliases rather than the correct URL above, then you will be sent to the top of the page, not to the right section. For faster loading as well as proper targeting, direct links to my sections should point to the sections of the [multi-file edition][39] of the guide, not to this single-file edition.

**General Guides to Philosophy on the Internet**
