 Intended as a companion to a blog post I wrote for a friend's blog: [http://graspedinthought.com/2016/08/0...][1] Often people speak about logic as if it were the unchanging monolith handed down through the ages. However, this is completely at odds with modern logic. In particular, Classical Logic (the standard logic taught) was created for practical, explicable reasons: to try and serve as the foundation of modern mathematics (e.g. Logicism). And while that program ultimately failed, in attempting it Frege developed a number of innovations which greatly progressed logic into the modern era by overcoming the limitations of Aristotelian Logic. This is an edited version of a larger talk given by logician Graham Priest on the mathematician Gottlob Frege, who was effectively the creator of Classical Logic. I edited the audio a bit to remove some background humming, and replaced some of the lower quality images Priest used with better quality images I found or made. The full, unedited talk can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foITi...][2] The painting of Frege from the thumbnail & intro was done by Renee Bolinger: [http://www-scf.usc.edu/~rbolinge/phil...][3] Meta: Length: 12 minutes, 9 seconds Resolution: 1920 x 1080p (upscaled & windowed) Bitrate: ~8000mbps Framerate: 30fps
