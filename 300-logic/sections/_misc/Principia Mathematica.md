# Principia Mathematica - Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell - Google Books

Principia Mathematica was first published in 1910-13; this is the ninth impression of the second edition of 1925-7. The Principia has long been recognised as one of the intellectual landmarks of the century. It was the first book to show clearly the close relationship between mathematics and formal logic. Starting from a minimal number of axioms, Whitehead and Russell display the structure of both kinds of thought. No other book has had such an influence on the subsequent history of mathematical philosophy.
