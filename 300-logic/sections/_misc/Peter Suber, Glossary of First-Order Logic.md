>

> 
> (1) an inference, (2) input to a function, (3) a subject-term for a predicate. See [corresponding argument][34].
> 
> **Arithmetic, formal system of**.
> 
> A first-order theory with a finite alphabet, and only finitely long wffs which, on its intended interpretation (1) contains theorems that express truths of number theory, and (2) permits the construction of a term to denote any natural number. See [first-order theory][35].
> 
> **Arithmetization**.
> 
> A generalized form of Gödel numbering in which distinct numerals are assigned to distinct symbols in the alphabet of a formal language. As a result every wff of the language can be re-expressed as a numeral (concatenating all the numerals for its component symbols). When done well, there can easily be an effective method for translating wffs into numerals and *vice versa*. See [Gödel numbering][36].
> 
> **Associated propositional formula (APF)**.
> 
> A wff A of propositional logic created from a wff B of predicate logic by (1) removing the quantifiers from B, and (2) replacing each predicate symbol (and its arguments) in B with a propositional symbol. Notation: Bprop = p.
> 
> **Atom**.
> 
> (1) In propositional logic, a simple proposition as opposed to a compound proposition or *molecule*. A wff without connectives. (2) In predicate logic, a wff without quantifiers or connectives.
> 
> **Attribute**.
> 
> A property of an object; also (at a different level) a monadic predicate symbolizing such a property. See [predicate logic][37]; [relation][38].
> 
> **Axioms**.
> 
> Wffs that are stipulated as unproved premises for the proof of other wffs inside a formal system.
> 
> -   **Axiom schema** (plural: schemata). A formula containing variables of the metalanguage which becomes an axiom when its variables are instantiated to wffs of the formal language.
> -   **Logical axiom**. An axiom that is a logically valid wff of the language of the system. See [logical validity][39].
> -   **Proper axiom**. An axiom that is not a logically valid wff of the language of the system (but is a closed wff).
> 
> **Axiom of choice**.
> 
> In set theory, a controversial axiom asserting that for a non-empty set A of non-empty disjoint sets, there is a set B with exactly one member from each of the disjoint sets comprising A. Sometimes the axiom is written so as to assert that there is a *function* for choosing the members of the disjoint sets comprising A that will become the members of B. Cantor's generalized continuum hypothesis implies the axiom of choice. Usually abbreviated to AC. Also called the multiplicative axiom. See [set theory][40].

> 
> **Church's thesis**.
> 
> Originally and narrowly, the thesis that all intuitively effective methods are generally recursive (in the sense of this term used in recursive function theory). Due to Alonzo Church, 1935. Currently and more broadly, the thesis that all intuitively effective methods are captured in any one of several formalizations, including recursive function theory, Turing machines, Markov algorithms, the Lambda calculus, and so on. See [effective method][104]; [recursive function theory][105].
> 
> **Closure of a system**.
> 
> A system with at least one closed term is closed iff At/x implies (x)Ax for each closed term t and each 1-wff A. (A 1-wff is a wff with exactly one free variable.) Informally, the system is closed if the fact that A is a theorem when its free variable is replaced with any closed term in the language implies the universal generalization (x)A. It follows from closure that every member of the domain is named by some closed term; hence the domain is countable. See [omega-completeness][106]; [term, closed][107]; [wff, open][108]. 
> 
> **Closure of a wff**.
> 
> In predicate logic, the binding of all free variables from a wff by placing them within the scope of suitable quantifiers. A closed wff is considered its own closure. The closure of a closure of a wff A is considered a closure of A. Notation: Ac (a closure of wff A). Closed wffs are also called *sentences*. See [bound variable][109]; [free variable][110]; [generalization][111]; [instantiation][112]; [wff][113].
> 
> **Complement of a set**.
> 
> The complement of a set A is the set of elements that are not members of A. Notation: A with a single bar over the top, or -A, or A'.
> 
> **Completeness**.
> 
> See [negation completeness][114]; [omega-completeness][115]; [semantic completeness][116]; [syntactic completeness][117].
> 
> **Component**.
> 
> A proposition that is part of a compound proposition. A component may itself be compound. For example, p is a component in pq, and pq is a component in (pq)r. 
> 
> **Composition (of a function)**.
> 
> One of the simple function-building operations of recursive function theory. Given the one-place functions f(x) and g(x), composition allows us to create function h thus: h(x) = f(g(x)). More generally, if f is an m-place, f(x1...xm), and there is a series of n-place functions g, g(x1...xn), then we can create the n-place function h by composition: h(x1...xn) = f(g(x1...xn),...,gm(x1...xn)). Also called substitution. See [recursive function theory][118].
> 
> **Compound proposition**.
> 
> A proposition made up of two or more simple propositions (components) joined by a connective. A compound proposition has just one truth-value for a given interpretation. Also called "molecules" (by writers who call simple propositions "atoms").
> 
> **Computable function**.
> 
> A total function for which there is an effective method for determining the value (output, member of the range), given the arguments (inputs, members of the domain). See [effective method][119]; [total function][120].
> 
> -   **Incomputable function**. A function for which there is no such effective method.
> 
> **Conclusion**.
> 
> The result of an argument or inference. The wff derived from or supported by premises. See argument; inference; premise.
> 
> **Conditional**.
> 
> See [implication][121].
> 
> **Conjunction**.
> 
> A truth-function that is true when both its arguments (called conjuncts) are true. Also the connective denoting this function; also the compound proposition built from this connective. Notation: p · q; sometimes also pq or pq.
> 
> **Conjunctive normal form (CNF)**.
> 
> The form of a of truth-functional compound when it is expressed as a series of conjuncts when each conjunct is either a simple proposition or the disjunction of simple propositions and the negations of simple propositions. See [disjunctive normal form][122].
> 
> **Connective**.
> 
> A symbol that functions to join two or more propositions into a compound proposition. Sometimes applied to symbols (like "~" for negation) which apply only to one proposition at a time. Sometimes applied to the function denoted by the symbol, rather than the symbol itself.
> 
> -   A truth-functional connective is a truth-function; its components are its arguments and the truth-value of the compound it forms is its value. See [truth function][123]; [truth-functional compound proposition][124]; [truth-functional connective][125].
> -   Connectives that apply to only one proposition at a time are monadic; those that join two propositions are dyadic; those that join three are triadic, and so on. Monadic connectives are also called operators.

> 
> **Constant**.
> 
> A symbol whose referent has been fixed. An abbreviation or name, as opposed to a place-holder (a variable). See [variable][135].
> 
> -   **Individual constant**. A symbol standing for an individual object from the domain of a system.
> -   **Predicate constant**. A symbol standing for an attribute or relation.
> -   **Propositional constant**. A symbol standing for a proposition.
> 
> **Constructive proof**.
> 
> A proof that actually produces an example of that which it proves to exist (which might be a number, wff, function, proof, etc. with certain properties). See [existence proof][136].
> 
> **Contingency**.
> 
> In truth-functional propositional logic, any proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction, hence any proposition that is sometimes true, sometimes false, depending on the row of its truth table column or the interpretation. See [contradiction][137]; [tautology][138].
> 
> **Continuum**.
> 
> The numerical continuum is the series of real numbers; the linear continuum is the series of points on a geometrical line.
> 
> **Continuum hypothesis**.
> 
> There is no cardinal, a, such that **À**0 < a < **c**, where **c** is the cardinality of the continuum. Proving or disproving the continuum hypothesis was the first problem on Hilbert's famous list of problems in 1900. Gödel (1938) and Cohen (1963) have proved that it is neither provable nor disprovable from standard set theory. Usually abbreviated to CH. See [set theory][139].
> 
> -   **Generalized continuum hypothesis**. For every transfinite cardinal, a, there is no cardinal b such that a < b < 2a. Usually abbreviated to GCH.
> 
> **Contradiction**.
> 
> (1) The conjunction of any proposition and its negation, (2) in truth-functional propositional logic, the negation of any tautology, hence any proposition that is false in every row of its truth table or in every interpretation. See [contingency][140]; [tautology][141].

> 
> A formal system in which there is an effective method for determining whether any given wff is a theorem. A system in which the set of theorems is a decidable set. The question whether a system is decidable is often called the *Entscheidungsproblem*, or decision problem. See [decidable set][171], [effective method][172], [effective proof procedure][173].
> 
> -   **Undecidable system**. A system for which there is no such effective method.
> 
> **Decidable wff**.
> 
> A wff that is either a theorem or the negation of a theorem. Either the wff or its negation is a theorem. Jargon: if wff A is decidable in system S, we often say that "S decides A".
> 
> -   **Undecidable wff**. A wff that is neither a theorem nor the negation of a theorem.
> 
> **Deduction**.
> 
> An inference in which (when valid) the conclusion contains no information that was not already present in the premises, or whose corresponding conditional is a tautology. See [corresponding conditional][174]; [induction][175]; [tautology][176]; [validity][177].

> A finite, non-empty sequence of wffs in which the last member is the wff derived, and each of the others (the premises) is either an axiom, a member of a set of accepted premises, or the result of applying a rule of inference to wffs preceding it in the sequence. See [corresponding argument][181]; [proof][182]. Notation: **Γ**A (the wff A can be derived from the set of wffs **Γ**). 
> 
> **Difference of sets**.

> **Effective method** (for a class of problems).
> 
> A method for solving problems in the class when the method (1) is logically bound as opposed to physically bound (2) to give some answer, as opposed to no answer, (3) that is correct, as opposed to incorrect, (4) in a finite number of steps, as opposed to an infinite number, (5) every time, or for all inputs, or for all problems in the class, as opposed to selectively, (6) if the method is followed carefully, as opposed to carelessly, (7) as far as necessary, as opposed to only as far as our resources permit, (8) when each step in the process is "dumb" or "mechanical". The eighth requirement introduces an irreducibly intuitive element into the definition. Some add (9) when given a problem from outside the the class for which the method is effective, the method may halt or loop forever without halting, but must not return a value as if it were the answer to the problem. (The wording of this definition was influenced by Geoffrey Hunter.) Also called algorithm; decision procedure. See [Church's Thesis][210].
> 
> **Effective proof procedure**.
> 
> An effective method for generating the proof of any theorem in a formal system. A system for which there exists an effective proof procedure is decidable; but not all decidable systems have effective proof procedures. See [decidable system][211].
> 
> **Enumerable set**.
> 
> Roughly, a set that can be translated into a sequence. More precisely, a set such that every one of its members has at least one counterpart in a certain sequence (though they may have more than one counterpart), and every term in the sequence has a counterpart in the set. The resulting sequence is called an enumeration of the set. The set {a, b, c} is enumerated by the sequence <a, b, c>, but also by the sequence <a, a, c, b>; it is not enumerated by the sequence <a, a, c, c>.
> 
> -   **Effectively enumerable set**. An enumerable set for which there is an effective method for ascertaining the *nth* term of the sequence for every positive integer *n*.
> -   **Recursively enumerable set**. A set that is effectively enumerable by some recursive function. Under Church's thesis, a set is recursively enumerable iff it is effectively enumerable. See [Church's thesis][212]; [recursive function][213].
> 
> **Epimenides paradox**.
> 
> See [liar paradox][214].
> 
> **Equivalence**.
> 
> A truth function that returns truth when its two arguments have the same truth-value, and false otherwise. Also the connective denoting this function; also the compound proposition built from this connective. Syntactically: the two propositions imply one another. Semantically: they have the same models. Also called a biconditional, or biconditional statement.
> 
> -   **Logical equivalence**. A tautologous statement of material equivalence (next).
> -   **Material equivalence**. A truth function that is true when its two arguments have the same truth-value (not necessarily the same meaning). Notation: pq, or p iff q.
> 
> **Equivalent sets**.
> 
> Two sets are equivalent iff they have the same cardinality, that is, if they can be put into one-to-one correspondence. Also called equinumerous sets. Notation: AB; sometimes A~B.
>

>

>

> 
> **Existential import**.
> 
> Quantified statements have existential import iff (in the standard interpretation) they are taken to assert the existence of their subjects. Aristotle held that all quantified propositions have existential import. The modern view, due to George Boole, is that existentially quantified statements do and that universally quantified statements do not. Hence in the modern view, (x)(Ax  Bx) ("All A's are B's") is non-committal on the existence of any A's; it may be true even for an interpretation whose domain contains no objects to instantiate x, or none that happen to be A's. By contrast, (x)(Ax&#183Bx) ("Some A's are B's") asserts the existence of at least one A, and it would be false for any interpretation whose domain contained no such values for x. See [predicate logic, inclusive][218]; [quantifier][219].

> An alphabet and grammar. The alphabet is a set of uninterpreted symbols. The grammar is a set of rules that determine which strings of symbols from the alphabet will be acceptable (grammatically correct or well-formed) in that language. The grammar may also be conceived as a set of functions taking strings of symbols as input and returning either "yes" or "no" as output. The rules of the grammar are also called formation rules.

Roughly, any consistent or omega-consistent formal system of arithmetic of "sufficient strength" is incomplete (negation incomplete and omega-incomplete).

These assignments can be captured by a function f so that (for example) for a constant, f(c) = object d from domain D; for a proposition, f(p) = true; for a truth-function, f() = material implication; for a function, f(g) = squaring the successor; or for a predicate, f(P) = the set of purple things. In propositional logic, an interpretation is just such a function; in predicate logic, it is some set (the domain) together with such a function defined for members of that domain.

Or when their domains map onto one another in the sense that their elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence and they stand in the same relations. To define isomorphism more precisely, let us say that D and D' are the domains of the two models under comparison, that for every member d of D there is a counterpart d' of D' and *vice versa*, that every function f defined for D has a counterpart function f' defined for D' and *vice versa*, and that every predicate P defined for D has a counterpart predicate P' defined for D' and *vice versa*. Now the two models are isomorphic iff these three conditions are met: (1) D and D' can be put into one-to-one correspondence, (2) for all functions f and f', f(d1...dn) = dn+1 iff f'(d1'...dn') = dn+1' and (3) for all predicates P and P', Pd1...dn iff P'd1'...dn'.

Roughly, if we are given a computable function f(x,y), then we posit another function g which computes the least value of y (a natural number) such that f(x,y) = 0. We say that g is created from f by minimization. One way that g might work is to start from 0 and test every natural number in order, stopping at the first value which makes f(x,y) = 0. See [recursive function theory][515]. Also called µ (Greek letter *mu*).
> 
> -   **Bounded minimization**. To insure that g is a total function, we create it from f by bounded minimization. We pick a bound z and try every value 0...z as the value of y; the first one to make f(x,y) = 0 is returned as the value of g; if none makes f(x,y) = 0, then g returns 0. Since g always returns a value, it is a total function; since z is always finite, g is computable.
> -   **Unbounded minimization**. If f(x,y) never equals 0, then g is undefined; hence g is a partial, hence incomputable, function. Think of g running on a computer; when it is unbounded, it will run forever with some inputs. It might test the values 0, 1, 2... in search of a value for y which will make f(x,y) = 0. But if there is no such y, and if no bound is put on the search, then the search will never halt.

(2) In predicate logic, a wff A is satisfied iff there is a sequence of objects from the domain of some interpretation such that A is true for that sequence. What it means for a wff to be true for a sequence is [defined differently][782] for several distinct kinds of predicate logic wff, e.g. quantified wffs, atomic wffs, wffs compounded with the various connectives of the language, and naked propositional symbols. Among atomic wffs, satisfaction is defined differently depending on whether the arguments of the predicate are constants, variables, or functions, and in the last case, whether the arguments of the functions are constants, variables, or functions. Hence the concept of satisfaction cannot be made more precise without giving each of perhaps a dozen precise tests for different kinds of wff. See [truth for an interpretation][783].

> **Truth for an interpretation**.
> 
> (1) For a wff of propositional logic, to be true under the assignments of a given interpretation. (2) For a wff of predicate logic, to be true for all sequences of some intepretation. Also called true for I. How a wff can be true for an interpretation must be defined separately for each connective in the language. See [connective][874]; [logical validity][875]; [satisfaction][876].
> 
> **Truth function**.
> 
> A total function from truth-values (or sequences of truth-values) to truth-values. See [conjunction][877]; [dagger function][878]; [disjunction][879]; equivalence; [function][880]; [implication][881]; [negation][882]; [stroke function][883].

> 
> A compound proposition whose truth-value can be determined solely on the basis of the truth-values of its components and the definitions of its connectives.
> 
> **Truth-functional connective**.
> 
> A connective that makes only truth-functional compounds. See [connective][884].
> 
> **Truth-functional propositional logic**.
> 
> The branch of logic that deals with the truth-functional connectives and the relations they permit among propositions. The logic of the relations between or among propositions, as opposed to predicate logic which covers the structure within propositions.
> 
> **Truth-value**.
> 
> The state of being true or the state of being false.
> 
> -   **2-valued logics**. Logics in which there are only two truth-values, namely, truth and falsehood.
> -   **Many-valued logics**. Logics that recognize more than two truth-values. In 3-valued logics, for example, the third truth-value is often "unknown" or "unprovable" or "neither true nor false". Also called *n*\-valued logics.

> The union of two sets, A and B, is the set of objects that are members of either A or B or both. Notation: AB. Also called the *sum* of two sets. AB =df {x : (xA)(xB)}. The union of sets is the set-theoretic equivalent of inclusive disjunction; for the equivalent of exclusive disjunction, see [symmetric difference of sets][918].
>

> 
> The set of all things. Cantor's theorem (that the power set of a given set has a greater cardinality than the given set) implies that there is no largest set or all-inclusive set, at least if every set has a power set. Hence as "the set of all things", the universal set is not recognized in standard set theory. Sometimes the set of all things under consideration in the context; the universe of discourse. The complement of the null set. Notation: 1 (numeral one), or V. See [complement][920]; [power set][921]; [universe of discourse][922].
