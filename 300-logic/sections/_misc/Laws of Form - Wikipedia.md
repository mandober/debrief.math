# Laws of Form - Wikipedia

Laws of Form (hereinafter LoF) is a book by G. Spencer-Brown, published in 1969, that straddles the boundary between mathematics and philosophy. LoF describes three distinct logical systems:
*__Laws of Form__* (hereinafter *__LoF__*) is a book by [G. Spencer-Brown][1], published in 1969, that straddles the boundary between [mathematics][2] and [philosophy][3]. *LoF* describes three distinct [logical systems][4]:

-   The "primary arithmetic" (described in Chapter 4 of *LoF*), whose models include [Boolean arithmetic][5];
-   The "primary [algebra][6]" (Chapter 6 of *LoF*), whose [models][7] include the [two-element Boolean algebra][8] (hereinafter abbreviated __2__), [Boolean logic][9], and the classical [propositional calculus][10];
-   "Equations of the second degree" (Chapter 11), whose [interpretations][11] include [finite automata][12] and [Alonzo Church][13]'s Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA).

"Boundary algebra" is Meguire's (2011)[\[1\]][14] term for the union of the primary algebra and the primary arithmetic. *Laws of Form* sometimes loosely refers to the "primary algebra" as well as to *LoF*.

## The book\[[edit][15]\]

The preface states that the work was first explored in 1959, and Spencer Brown cites [Bertrand Russell][16] as being supportive of his endeavour. He also thanks [J. C. P. Miller][17] of [University College London][18] for helping with the proof reading and offering other guidance. In 1963 Spencer Brown was invited by [Harry Frost][19], staff lecturer in the physical sciences at the department of Extra-Mural Studies of the [University of London][20] to deliver a course on the mathematics of logic.

*LoF* emerged from work in electronic engineering its author did around 1960, and from subsequent lectures on [mathematical logic][21] he gave under the auspices of the [University of London][22]'s extension program. *LoF* has appeared in several editions. The second series of editions appeared in 1972 with the "Preface to the First American Edition" which emphasised the use of self-referential paradoxes.[\[2\]][23] the most recent being a 1997 German translation, and has never gone out of print.

The mathematics fills only about 55pp and is rather elementary.\[*[original research?][24]*\] But *LoF'*s mystical and declamatory prose, and its love of [paradox][25], make it a challenging read for all. Spencer-Brown was influenced by [Wittgenstein][26] and [R. D. Laing][27]. *LoF* also echoes a number of themes from the writings of [Charles Sanders Peirce][28], [Bertrand Russell][29], and [Alfred North Whitehead][30].

The entire book is written in an operational way, giving instructions to the reader instead of telling them what "is". In accordance with G. Spencer-Brown's interest in paradoxes, the only sentence that makes a statement that something is, is the statement, which says no such statements are used in this book.[\[3\]][31] Except for this one sentence the book can be seen as an example of [E-Prime][32].

## Reception\[[edit][33]\]

Ostensibly a work of formal mathematics and philosophy, *LoF* became something of a [cult classic][34]: it was praised by [Heinz von Foerster][35] when he reviewed it for the *[Whole Earth Catalog][36]*.[\[4\]][37] Those who agree point to *LoF* as embodying an enigmatic "mathematics of [consciousness][38]", its algebraic symbolism capturing an (perhaps even "the") implicit root of [cognition][39]: the ability to "distinguish". *LoF* argues that primary algebra reveals striking connections among [logic][40], [Boolean algebra][41], and arithmetic, and the [philosophy of language][42] and [mind][43].

Banaschewski (1977)[\[5\]][44] argues that the primary algebra is nothing but new notation for Boolean algebra. Indeed, the [two-element Boolean algebra][45] __2__ can be seen as the intended interpretation of the primary algebra. Yet the notation of the primary algebra:

-   Fully exploits the [duality][46] characterizing not just [Boolean algebras][47] but all [lattices][48];
-   Highlights how syntactically distinct statements in logic and __2__ can have identical [semantics][49];
-   Dramatically simplifies Boolean algebra calculations, and proofs in [sentential][50] and [syllogistic][51] [logic][52].

Moreover, the syntax of the primary algebra can be extended to formal systems other than __2__ and sentential logic, resulting in boundary mathematics (see [§ Related Work][53] below).

*LoF* has influenced, among others, [Heinz von Foerster][54], [Louis Kauffman][55], [Niklas Luhmann][56], [Humberto Maturana][57], [Francisco Varela][58] and [William Bricken][59]. Some of these authors have modified the primary algebra in a variety of interesting ways.

*LoF* claimed that certain well-known mathematical conjectures of very long standing, such as the [four color theorem][60], [Fermat's Last Theorem][61], and the [Goldbach conjecture][62], are provable using extensions of the primary algebra. Spencer-Brown eventually circulated a purported proof of the four color theorem, but it met with skepticism.[\[6\]][63]

## The form (Chapter 1)\[[edit][64]\]

The symbol:

[![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][65]

Also called the "mark" or "cross", is the essential feature of the Laws of Form. In Spencer-Brown's inimitable and enigmatic fashion, the Mark symbolizes the root of [cognition][66], i.e., the [dualistic][67] Mark indicates the capability of differentiating a "this" from "everything else *but* this".

In *LoF*, a Cross denotes the drawing of a "distinction", and can be thought of as signifying the following, all at once:

-   The act of drawing a boundary around something, thus separating it from everything else;
-   That which becomes distinct from everything by drawing the boundary;
-   Crossing from one side of the boundary to the other.

All three ways imply an action on the part of the cognitive entity (e.g., person) making the distinction. As *LoF* puts it:

> "The first command:
> 
> -   Draw a distinction
> 
> can well be expressed in such ways as:
> 
> -   Let there be a distinction,
> -   Find a distinction,
> -   See a distinction,
> -   Describe a distinction,
> -   Define a distinction,
> 
> Or:
> 
> -   Let a distinction be drawn". (*LoF*, Notes to chapter 2)

The counterpoint to the Marked state is the Unmarked state, which is simply nothing, the void, or the un-expressable infinite represented by a blank space. It is simply the absence of a Cross. No distinction has been made and nothing has been crossed. The Marked state and the void are the two primitive values of the Laws of Form.

The Cross can be seen as denoting the distinction between two states, one "considered as a symbol" and another not so considered. From this fact arises a curious resonance with some theories of [consciousness][68] and [language][69]. Paradoxically, the Form is at once Observer and Observed, and is also the creative act of making an observation. *LoF* (excluding back matter) closes with the words:

> ...the first distinction, the Mark and the observer are not only interchangeable, but, in the form, identical.

[C. S. Peirce][70] came to a related insight in the 1890s; see [§ Related work][71].

## The primary arithmetic (Chapter 4)\[[edit][72]\]

The [syntax][73] of the primary arithmetic goes as follows. There are just two [atomic expressions][74]:

-   The empty Cross [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][75]  ;
-   All or part of the blank page (the "void").

There are two inductive rules:

-   A Cross [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][76] may be written over any expression;
-   Any two expressions may be [concatenated][77].

The [semantics][78] of the primary arithmetic are perhaps nothing more than the sole explicit [definition][79] in *LoF*: "Distinction is perfect continence".

Let the "unmarked state" be a synonym for the void. Let an empty Cross denote the "marked state". To cross is to move from one value, the unmarked or marked state, to the other. We can now state the "arithmetical" [axioms][80] A1 and A2, which ground the primary arithmetic (and hence all of the Laws of Form):

"A1. The law of Calling". Calling twice from a state is indistinguishable from calling once. To make a distinction twice has the same effect as making it once. For example, saying "Let there be light" and then saying "Let there be light" again, is the same as saying it once. Formally:

[![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][81] [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][82] ![\ =](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7761beb38f234256f3346411708efb3d03889a4b)[![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][83]

"A2. The law of Crossing". After crossing from the unmarked to the marked state, crossing again ("recrossing") starting from the marked state returns one to the unmarked state. Hence recrossing annuls crossing. Formally:

[![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][84] ![\ =](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7761beb38f234256f3346411708efb3d03889a4b)

In both A1 and A2, the expression to the right of '=' has fewer symbols than the expression to the left of '='. This suggests that every primary arithmetic expression can, by repeated application of A1 and A2, be *simplified* to one of two states: the marked or the unmarked state. This is indeed the case, and the result is the expression's "simplification". The two fundamental metatheorems of the primary arithmetic state that:

-   Every finite expression has a unique simplification. (T3 in *LoF*);
-   Starting from an initial marked or unmarked state, "complicating" an expression by a finite number of repeated application of A1 and A2 cannot yield an expression whose simplification differs from the initial state. (T4 in *LoF*).

Thus the [relation][85] of [logical equivalence][86] [partitions][87] all primary arithmetic expressions into two [equivalence classes][88]: those that simplify to the Cross, and those that simplify to the void.

A1 and A2 have loose analogs in the properties of series and parallel electrical circuits, and in other ways of diagramming processes, including flowcharting. A1 corresponds to a parallel connection and A2 to a series connection, with the understanding that making a distinction corresponds to changing how two points in a circuit are connected, and not simply to adding wiring.

The primary arithmetic is analogous to the following formal languages from [mathematics][89] and [computer science][90]:

-   A [Dyck language][91] of order 1 with a null alphabet;
-   The simplest [context-free language][92] in the [Chomsky hierarchy][93];
-   A [rewrite system][94] that is [strongly normalizing][95] and [confluent][96].

The phrase "calculus of indications" in *LoF* is a synonym for "primary arithmetic".

### The notion of canon\[[edit][97]\]

A concept peculiar to *LoF* is that of "canon". While *LoF* does not define canon, the following two excerpts from the Notes to chpt. 2 are apt:

> The more important structures of command are sometimes called *canons*. They are the ways in which the guiding injunctions appear to group themselves in constellations, and are thus by no means independent of each other. A canon bears the distinction of being outside (i.e., describing) the system under construction, but a command to construct (e.g., 'draw a distinction'), even though it may be of central importance, is not a canon. A canon is an order, or set of orders, to permit or allow, but not to construct or create.

> ...the primary form of mathematical communication is not description but injunction... Music is a similar art form, the composer does not even attempt to describe the set of sounds he has in mind, much less the set of feelings occasioned through them, but writes down a set of commands which, if they are obeyed by the performer, can result in a reproduction, to the listener, of the composer's original experience.

These excerpts relate to the distinction in [metalogic][98] between the [object language][99], the formal language of the logical system under discussion, and the [metalanguage][100], a language (often a natural language) distinct from the object language, employed to exposit and discuss the object language. The first quote seems to assert that the *canons* are part of the metalanguage. The second quote seems to assert that statements in the object language are essentially commands addressed to the reader by the author. Neither assertion holds in standard metalogic.

## The primary algebra (Chapter 6)\[[edit][101]\]

### Syntax\[[edit][102]\]

Given any valid primary arithmetic expression, insert into one or more locations any number of Latin letters bearing optional numerical subscripts; the result is a primary algebra [formula][103]. Letters so employed in [mathematics][104] and [logic][105] are called [variables][106]. A primary algebra variable indicates a location where one can write the primitive value [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][107] or its complement [![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][108]. Multiple instances of the same variable denote multiple locations of the same primitive value.

### Rules governing logical equivalence\[[edit][109]\]

The sign '=' may link two logically equivalent expressions; the result is an [equation][110]. By "logically equivalent" is meant that the two expressions have the same simplification. [Logical equivalence][111] is an [equivalence relation][112] over the set of primary algebra formulas, governed by the rules R1 and R2. Let "C" and "D" be formulae each containing at least one instance of the subformula *A*:

-   __R1__, *Substitution of equals*. Replace *one or more* instances of *A* in *C* by *B*, resulting in *E*. If *A*\=*B*, then *C*\=*E*.
-   __R2__, *Uniform replacement*. Replace *all* instances of *A* in *C* and *D* with *B*. *C* becomes *E* and *D* becomes *F*. If *C*\=*D*, then *E*\=*F*. Note that *A*\=*B* is not required.

__R2__ is employed very frequently in *primary algebra* demonstrations (see below), almost always silently. These rules are routinely invoked in [logic][113] and most of mathematics, nearly always unconsciously.

The *primary algebra* consists of [equations][114], i.e., pairs of formulae linked by an infix '='. __R1__ and __R2__ enable transforming one equation into another. Hence the *primary algebra* is an *equational* formal system, like the many [algebraic structures][115], including [Boolean algebra][116], that are [varieties][117]. Equational logic was common before *Principia Mathematica* (e.g., Peirce,1,2,3 Johnson 1892), and has present-day advocates (Gries and Schneider 1993).

Conventional [mathematical logic][118] consists of [tautological][119] formulae, signalled by a prefixed [turnstile][120]. To denote that the *primary algebra* formula *A* is a [tautology][121], simply write "*A* =[![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][122] ". If one replaces '=' in __R1__ and __R2__ with the [biconditional][123], the resulting rules hold in conventional logic. However, conventional logic relies mainly on the rule [modus ponens][124]; thus conventional logic is *ponential*. The equational-ponential dichotomy distills much of what distinguishes mathematical logic from the rest of mathematics.

### Initials\[[edit][125]\]

An *initial* is a *primary algebra* equation verifiable by a [decision procedure][126] and as such is *not* an [axiom][127]. *LoF* lays down the initials:

The absence of anything to the right of the "=" above, is deliberate.

__J2__ is the familiar [distributive law][128] of [sentential logic][129] and [Boolean algebra][130].

Another set of initials, friendlier to calculations, is:

It is thanks to __C2__ that the *primary algebra* is a [lattice][131]. By virtue of __J1a__, it is a [complemented lattice][132] whose upper bound is [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][133]. By __J0__, [![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][134] is the corresponding lower bound and [identity element][135]. __J0__ is also an algebraic version of __A2__ and makes clear the sense in which [![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][136] aliases with the blank page.

T13 in *LoF* generalizes __C2__ as follows. Any *primary algebra* (or sentential logic) formula *B* can be viewed as an [ordered tree][137] with *branches*. Then:

__T13__: A [subformula][138] *A* can be copied at will into any depth of *B* greater than that of *A*, as long as *A* and its copy are in the same branch of *B*. Also, given multiple instances of *A* in the same branch of *B*, all instances but the shallowest are redundant.

While a proof of T13 would require [induction][139], the intuition underlying it should be clear.

__C2__ or its equivalent is named:

-   "Generation" in *LoF*;
-   "Exclusion" in Johnson (1892);
-   "Pervasion" in the work of William Bricken.

Perhaps the first instance of an axiom or rule with the power of __C2__ was the "Rule of (De)Iteration", combining T13 and *AA=A*, of [C. S. Peirce][140]'s [existential graphs][141].

*LoF* asserts that concatenation can be read as [commuting][142] and [associating][143] by default and hence need not be explicitly assumed or demonstrated. (Peirce made a similar assertion about his [existential graphs][144].) Let a period be a temporary notation to establish grouping. That concatenation commutes and associates may then be demonstrated from the:

-   Initial *AC.D*\=*CD.A* and the consequence *AA*\=*A* (Byrne 1946). This result holds for all [lattices][145], because *AA*\=*A* is an easy consequence of the [absorption law][146], which holds for all lattices;
-   Initials *AC.D*\=*AD.C* and __J0__. Since __J0__ holds only for lattices with a lower bound, this method holds only for [bounded lattices][147] (which include the *primary algebra* and __2__). Commutativity is trivial; just set *A*\=[![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][148]. Associativity: *AC.D* = *CA.D* = *CD.A* = *A.CD*.

Having demonstrated associativity, the period can be discarded.

The initials in Meguire (2011) are *AC.D*\=*CD.A*, called __B1__; __B2__, J0 above; __B3__, J1a above; and __B4__, C2. By design, these initials are very similar to the axioms for an [abelian group][149], __G1-G3__ below.

### Proof theory\[[edit][150]\]

The *primary algebra* contains three kinds of proved assertions:

-   *Consequence* is a *primary algebra* equation verified by a *demonstration*. A demonstration consists of a sequence of *steps*, each step justified by an initial or a previously demonstrated consequence.
-   *[Theorem][151]* is a statement in the [metalanguage][152] verified by a *[proof][153]*, i.e., an argument, formulated in the metalanguage, that is accepted by trained mathematicians and logicians.
-   *Initial*, defined above. Demonstrations and proofs invoke an initial as if it were an axiom.

The distinction between consequence and [theorem][154] holds for all formal systems, including mathematics and logic, but is usually not made explicit. A demonstration or [decision procedure][155] can be carried out and verified by computer. The [proof][156] of a [theorem][157] cannot be.

Let *A* and *B* be *primary algebra* [formulas][158]. A demonstration of *A*\=*B* may proceed in either of two ways:

Once *A*\=*B* has been demonstrated, *A*\=*B* can be invoked to justify steps in subsequent demonstrations. *primary algebra* demonstrations and calculations often require no more than __J1a__, __J2__, __C2__, and the consequences [![Laws of Form - ()A=().png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Laws_of_Form_-_%28%29A%3D%28%29.png/80px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28%29A%3D%28%29.png)][159] (__C3__ in *LoF*), [![Laws of Form - ((A))=A.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Laws_of_Form_-_%28%28A%29%29%3DA.png/80px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28%28A%29%29%3DA.png)][160] (__C1__), and *AA*\=*A* (__C5__).

The consequence [![Laws of Form - (((A)B)C)=(AC)((B)C).png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Laws_of_Form_-_%28%28%28A%29B%29C%29%3D%28AC%29%28%28B%29C%29.png/170px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28%28%28A%29B%29C%29%3D%28AC%29%28%28B%29C%29.png)][161], __C7' *in* LoF*, enables an [algorithm][162], sketched in* LoF__s proof of T14, that transforms an arbitrary *primary algebra* formula to an equivalent formula whose depth does not exceed two. The result is a *normal form*, the *primary algebra* analog of the [conjunctive normal form][163]. *LoF* (T14–15) proves the *primary algebra* analog of the well-known [Boolean algebra][164] theorem that every formula has a normal form.

Let *A* be a [subformula][165] of some [formula][166] *B*. When paired with __C3__, __J1a__ can be viewed as the closure condition for calculations: *B* is a [tautology][167] [if and only if][168] *A* and (*A*) both appear in depth 0 of *B*. A related condition appears in some versions of [natural deduction][169]. A demonstration by calculation is often little more than:

-   Invoking T13 repeatedly to eliminate redundant subformulae;
-   Erasing any subformulae having the form [![Laws of Form - ((A)A).png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Laws_of_Form_-_%28%28A%29A%29.png/50px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28%28A%29A%29.png)][170].

The last step of a calculation always invokes __J1a__.

*LoF* includes elegant new proofs of the following standard [metatheory][171]:

-   *[Completeness][172]*: all *primary algebra* consequences are demonstrable from the initials (T17).
-   *[Independence][173]*: __J1__ cannot be demonstrated from __J2__ and vice versa (T18).

That [sentential logic][174] is complete is taught in every first university course in [mathematical logic][175]. But university courses in Boolean algebra seldom mention the completeness of __2__.

### Interpretations\[[edit][176]\]

If the Marked and Unmarked states are read as the [Boolean][177] values 1 and 0 (or __True__ and __False__), the *primary algebra* [interprets][178] __[2][179]__ (or [sentential logic][180]). *LoF* shows how the *primary algebra* can interpret the [syllogism][181]. Each of these [interpretations][182] is discussed in a subsection below. Extending the *primary algebra* so that it could [interpret][183] standard [first-order logic][184] has yet to be done, but [Peirce][185]'s *beta* [existential graphs][186] suggest that this extension is feasible.

#### Two-element Boolean algebra 2\[[edit][187]\]

The *primary algebra* is an elegant minimalist notation for the [two-element Boolean algebra][188] __2__. Let:

-   One of Boolean [join][189] (+) or [meet][190] (×) interpret [concatenation][191];
-   The [complement][192] of *A* interpret [![Laws of Form - not a.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Laws_of_Form_-_not_a.gif)][193]
-   0 (1) interpret the empty Mark if join (meet) interprets [concatenation][194] (because a binary operation applied to zero operands may be regarded as being equal to the [identity element][195] of that operation; or to put it in another way, an operand that is missing could be regarded as acting by default like the identity element).

If join (meet) interprets *AC*, then meet (join) interprets ![{\displaystyle {\overline {{\overline {A|}}\ \ {\overline {C|}}{\Big |}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/65558bea04a80ac0805a4384eed5716f3f8eea70). Hence the *primary algebra* and __2__ are isomorphic but for one detail: *primary algebra* complementation can be nullary, in which case it denotes a primitive value. Modulo this detail, __2__ is a [model][196] of the primary algebra. The primary arithmetic suggests the following arithmetic axiomatization of __2__: 1+1=1+0=0+1=1=~0, and 0+0=0=~1.

The [set][197] ![\ B=\{](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4eca7dca273624da7e22378ffd5ee8d57a609afc)[![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][198] ![,](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b8fa4cba3a446de313920e16251756e27312b825) [![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][199]![\ \}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/0311cea8a3f1d37d7c0d25e947db5e2fc73cb7cc) is the [Boolean domain][200] or *carrier*. In the language of [universal algebra][201], the *primary algebra* is the [algebraic structure][202] ![{\displaystyle \langle B,-\ -,{\overline {-\ |}},{\overline {\ \ |}}\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f950e7faa316e50970342b92a8866f92ea3d64f9) of type ![\langle 2,1,0\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/156359d0dfb971a7bdf12bdc3a7fa33ba7d6bc6b). The [expressive adequacy][203] of the [Sheffer stroke][204] points to the *primary algebra* also being a ![{\displaystyle \langle B,{\overline {-\ -\ |}},{\overline {\ \ |}}\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d80da2ceec1c16ac1898e2967b6e3dc2a614c6d6) algebra of type ![\langle 2,0\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d20c4b62d66311509f27d87c0b7ea9189693e2a3). In both cases, the identities are J1a, J0, C2, and *ACD=CDA*. Since the *primary algebra* and __2__ are [isomorphic][205], __2__ can be seen as a ![\langle B,+,\lnot ,1\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7dfe3db745537065269e03be4bab9cf79cb5ef44) algebra of type ![\langle 2,1,0\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/156359d0dfb971a7bdf12bdc3a7fa33ba7d6bc6b). This description of __2__ is simpler than the conventional one, namely an ![\langle B,+,\times ,\lnot ,1,0\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6526b78a06d5e177ccf55f95f6197261767fb365) algebra of type ![\langle 2,2,1,0,0\rangle ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3b8fad55cdb4ed42d645feba54623c8fd96cd00a).

The two possible interpretations are dual to each other in the Boolean sense. (In Boolean algebra, exchanging AND ↔ OR and 1 ↔ 0 throughout an equation yields an equally valid equation.) The identities remain invariant regardless of which interpretation is chosen, so the transformations or modes of calculation remain the same; only the interpretation of each form would be different. Example: J1a is [![Laws of Form - (A)A=().png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Laws_of_Form_-_%28A%29A%3D%28%29.png/80px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28A%29A%3D%28%29.png)][206]. Interpreting juxtaposition as OR and [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][207] as 1, this translates to ![{\displaystyle \neg A\lor A=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6ba643478c54517ce9d9f59c8ba03901d1b6946) which is true. Interpreting juxtaposition as AND and [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][208] as 0, this translates to ![{\displaystyle \neg A\land A=0}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7e0d239fb45031416d15ddd168d38a01e66852c5) which is true as well (and the dual of ![{\displaystyle \neg A\lor A=1}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b6ba643478c54517ce9d9f59c8ba03901d1b6946)).

#### Sentential logic\[[edit][209]\]

Let the blank page denote __False__, and let a Cross be read as __Not__. Then the primary arithmetic has the following sentential reading:

 =   __False__

[![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][210]  =  __True__  =  __not False__

[![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][211]  =  __Not True__  =  __False__

The *primary algebra* interprets sentential logic as follows. A letter represents any given sentential expression. Thus:

[![Laws of Form - not a.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Laws_of_Form_-_not_a.gif)][212] interprets __Not A__

[![Laws of Form - a or b.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Laws_of_Form_-_a_or_b.gif)][213] interprets __A Or B__

[![Laws of Form - if a then b.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Laws_of_Form_-_if_a_then_b.gif)][214] interprets __Not A Or B__ or __If A Then B__.

[![Laws of Form - a and b.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Laws_of_Form_-_a_and_b.gif)][215] interprets __Not (Not A Or Not B)__

or __Not (If A Then Not B)__

or __A And B__.

Thus any expression in [sentential logic][216] has a *primary algebra* translation. Equivalently, the *primary algebra* [interprets][217] sentential logic. Given an assignment of every variable to the Marked or Unmarked states, this *primary algebra* translation reduces to a primary arithmetic expression, which can be simplified. Repeating this exercise for all possible assignments of the two primitive values to each variable, reveals whether the original expression is [tautological][218] or [satisfiable][219]. This is an example of a [decision procedure][220], one more or less in the spirit of conventional truth tables. Given some *primary algebra* formula containing *N* variables, this decision procedure requires simplifying 2*N* primary arithmetic formulae. For a less tedious decision procedure more in the spirit of [Quine][221]'s "truth value analysis", see Meguire (2003).

Schwartz (1981) proved that the *primary algebra* is equivalent — [syntactically][222], [semantically][223], and [proof theoretically][224] — with the [classical propositional calculus][225]. Likewise, it can be shown that the *primary algebra* is syntactically equivalent with expressions built up in the usual way from the classical [truth values][226] __true__ and __false__, the [logical connectives][227] NOT, OR, and AND, and parentheses.

Interpreting the Unmarked State as __False__ is wholly arbitrary; that state can equally well be read as __True__. All that is required is that the interpretation of [concatenation][228] change from OR to AND. IF A THEN B now translates as [![Laws of Form - (A(B)).png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Laws_of_Form_-_%28A%28B%29%29.png/50px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28A%28B%29%29.png)][229] instead of [![Laws of Form - (A)B.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b2/Laws_of_Form_-_%28A%29B.png/50px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28A%29B.png)][230]. More generally, the *primary algebra* is "self-[dual][231]", meaning that any *primary algebra* formula has two [sentential][232] or [Boolean][233] readings, each the [dual][234] of the other. Another consequence of self-duality is the irrelevance of [De Morgan's laws][235]; those laws are built into the syntax of the *primary algebra* from the outset.

The true nature of the distinction between the *primary algebra* on the one hand, and __2__ and sentential logic on the other, now emerges. In the latter formalisms, [complementation][236]/[negation][237] operating on "nothing" is not well-formed. But an empty Cross is a well-formed *primary algebra* expression, denoting the Marked state, a primitive value. Hence a nonempty Cross is an [operator][238], while an empty Cross is an [operand][239] because it denotes a primitive value. Thus the *primary algebra* reveals that the heretofore distinct mathematical concepts of operator and operand are in fact merely different facets of a single fundamental action, the making of a distinction.

#### Syllogisms\[[edit][240]\]

Appendix 2 of *LoF* shows how to translate traditional [syllogisms][241] and [sorites][242] into the *primary algebra*. A valid syllogism is simply one whose *primary algebra* translation simplifies to an empty Cross. Let *A*\* denote a *literal*, i.e., either *A* or ![{\displaystyle {\overline {A|}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d9ea654347d44377b18a173ff8fdb403479ee129), indifferently. Then every syllogism that does not require that one or more terms be assumed nonempty is one of 24 possible permutations of a generalization of [Barbara][243] whose *primary algebra* equivalent is ![{\displaystyle {\overline {A^{*}\ B|}}\ \ {\overline {{\overline {B|}}\ C^{*}{\Big |}}}\ A^{*}\ C^{*}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/89f560db1fe95889a69ab81bbcdc8a167bc7661b). These 24 possible permutations include the 19 syllogistic forms deemed valid in [Aristotelian][244] and [medieval logic][245]. This *primary algebra* translation of syllogistic logic also suggests that the *primary algebra* can [interpret][246] [monadic][247] and [term logic][248], and that the *primary algebra* has affinities to the [Boolean term schemata][249] of Quine (1982: Part II).

### An example of calculation\[[edit][250]\]

The following calculation of [Leibniz][251]'s nontrivial *Praeclarum Theorema* exemplifies the demonstrative power of the *primary algebra*. Let C1 be ![{\displaystyle {\overline {{\overline {A|}}{\Big |}}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8e36aba809fbe1f7b88c346830161d6048673cb6) =*A*, C2 be ![{\displaystyle A\ {\overline {A\ B|}}=A\ {\overline {B|}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1643745fd035d0d22935c1f51c4033e0d01dd4a3), C3 be ![{\displaystyle {\overline {\ \ |}}\ A={\overline {\ \ |}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/28fb47179494aa1342e5d2d3982165c4c95dfc30), J1a be ![{\displaystyle {\overline {A|}}\ A={\overline {\ \ |}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/2241f5723d5b2b1a80b25698c5710bce844ff880), and let OI mean that variables and subformulae have been reordered in a way that commutativity and associativity permit.

### Relation to magmas\[[edit][252]\]

The *primary algebra* embodies a point noted by [Huntington][253] in 1933: [Boolean algebra][254] requires, in addition to one [unary operation][255], one, and not two, [binary operations][256]. Hence the seldom-noted fact that Boolean algebras are [magmas][257]. (Magmas were called [groupoids][258] until the latter term was appropriated by [category theory][259].) To see this, note that the *primary algebra* is a [commutative][260]:

-   [Semigroup][261] because *primary algebra* juxtaposition [commutes][262] and [associates][263];
-   [Monoid][264] with [identity element][265] [![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][266], by virtue of __J0__.

[Groups][267] also require a [unary operation][268], called [inverse][269], the group counterpart of [Boolean complementation][270]. Let [![Laws of Form - (a).png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Laws_of_Form_-_%28a%29.png/20px-Laws_of_Form_-_%28a%29.png)][271] denote the inverse of *a*. Let [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][272] denote the group [identity element][273]. Then groups and the *primary algebra* have the same [signatures][274], namely they are both ![{\displaystyle \langle -\ -,{\overline {-\ |}},{\overline {\ \ |}}\rangle }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/eee5d2045fdc635698605f3e9e2c9cfd100184a1) algebras of type 〈2,1,0〉. Hence the *primary algebra* is a [boundary algebra][275]. The axioms for an [abelian group][276], in boundary notation, are:

From __G1__ and __G2__, the commutativity and associativity of concatenation may be derived, as above. Note that __G3__ and __J1a__ are identical. __G2__ and __J0__ would be identical if   [![Laws of Form - double cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif/25px-Laws_of_Form_-_double_cross.gif)][277] = [![Laws of Form - cross.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif/20px-Laws_of_Form_-_cross.gif)][278]   replaced __A2__. This is the defining arithmetical identity of group theory, in boundary notation.

The *primary algebra* differs from an [abelian group][279] in two ways:

Both __A2__ and __C2__ follow from *B* 's being an [ordered set][280].

## Equations of the second degree (Chapter 11)\[[edit][281]\]

Chapter 11 of *LoF* introduces *equations of the second degree*, composed of [recursive][282] formulae that can be seen as having "infinite" depth. Some recursive formulae simplify to the marked or unmarked state. Others "oscillate" indefinitely between the two states depending on whether a given depth is even or odd. Specifically, certain recursive formulae can be interpreted as oscillating between __true__ and __false__ over successive intervals of time, in which case a formula is deemed to have an "imaginary" truth value. Thus the flow of time may be introduced into the *primary algebra*.

Turney (1986) shows how these recursive formulae can be interpreted via [Alonzo Church][283]'s Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA). Church introduced RRA in 1955 as an axiomatic formalization of [finite automata][284]. Turney (1986) presents a general method for translating equations of the second degree into Church's RRA, illustrating his method using the formulae __E1__, __E2__, and __E4__ in chapter 11 of *LoF*. This translation into RRA sheds light on the names Spencer-Brown gave to __E1__ and __E4__, namely "memory" and "counter". RRA thus formalizes and clarifies *LoF* 's notion of an imaginary truth value.

## \[[edit][285]\]

[Gottfried Leibniz][286], in memoranda not published before the late 19th and early 20th centuries, invented [Boolean logic][287]. His notation was isomorphic to that of *LoF*: concatenation read as [conjunction][288], and "non-(*X*)" read as the [complement][289] of *X*. Recognition of Leibniz's pioneering role in [algebraic logic][290] was foreshadowed by [Lewis][291] (1918) and [Rescher][292] (1954). But a full appreciation of Leibniz's accomplishments had to await the work of Wolfgang Lenzen, published in the 1980s and reviewed in Lenzen (2004).

[Charles Sanders Peirce][293] (1839–1914) anticipated the *primary algebra* in three veins of work:

1.  Two papers he wrote in 1886 proposed a logical algebra employing but one symbol, the *streamer*, nearly identical to the Cross of *LoF*. The semantics of the streamer are identical to those of the Cross, except that Peirce never wrote a streamer with nothing under it. An excerpt from one of these papers was published in 1976,[\[7\]][294] but they were not published in full until 1993.[\[8\]][295]
2.  In a 1902 encyclopedia article,[\[9\]][296] Peirce notated Boolean algebra and sentential logic in the manner of this entry, except that he employed two styles of brackets, toggling between '(', ')' and '\[', '\]' with each increment in formula depth.
3.  The [syntax][297] of his alpha [existential graphs][298] is merely [concatenation][299], read as [conjunction][300], and enclosure by ovals, read as [negation][301].[\[10\]][302] If *primary algebra* concatenation is read as [conjunction][303], then these graphs are [isomorphic][304] to the *primary algebra* (Kauffman 2001).

Ironically, *LoF* cites vol. 4 of Peirce's *Collected Papers,* the source for the formalisms in (2) and (3) above. (1)-(3) were virtually unknown at the time when (1960s) and in the place where (UK) *LoF* was written. Peirce's [semiotics][305], about which *LoF* is silent, may yet shed light on the philosophical aspects of *LoF*.

Kauffman (2001) discusses another notation similar to that of *LoF*, that of a 1917 article by [Jean Nicod][306], who was a disciple of [Bertrand Russell][307]'s.

The above formalisms are, like the *primary algebra*, all instances of *boundary mathematics*, i.e., mathematics whose syntax is limited to letters and brackets (enclosing devices). A minimalist syntax of this nature is a "boundary notation". Boundary notation is free of [infix][308], [prefix][309], or [postfix][310] operator symbols. The very well known curly braces ('{', '}') of set theory can be seen as a boundary notation.

The work of Leibniz, Peirce, and Nicod is innocent of metatheory, as they wrote before [Emil Post][311]'s landmark 1920 paper (which *LoF* cites), proving that [sentential logic][312] is complete, and before [Hilbert][313] and [Łukasiewicz][314] showed how to prove [axiom independence][315] using [models][316].

[Craig][317] (1979) argued that the world, and how humans perceive and interact with that world, has a rich Boolean structure. Craig was an orthodox logician and an authority on [algebraic logic][318].

Second-generation [cognitive science][319] emerged in the 1970s, after *LoF* was written. On cognitive science and its relevance to Boolean algebra, logic, and [set theory][320], see Lakoff (1987) (see index entries under "Image schema examples: container") and Lakoff and Núñez (2001). Neither book cites *LoF*.

The biologists and cognitive scientists [Humberto Maturana][321] and his student [Francisco Varela][322] both discuss *LoF* in their writings, which identify "distinction" as the fundamental cognitive act. The Berkeley psychologist and cognitive scientist [Eleanor Rosch][323] has written extensively on the closely related notion of categorization.

Other formal systems with possible affinities to the primary algebra include:

-   [Mereology][324] which typically has a [lattice][325] structure very similar to that of Boolean algebra. For a few authors, mereology is simply a [model][326] of [Boolean algebra][327] and hence of the primary algebra as well.
-   [Mereotopology][328], which is inherently richer than Boolean algebra;
-   The system of Whitehead (1934), whose fundamental primitive is "indication".

The primary arithmetic and algebra are a minimalist formalism for [sentential logic][329] and Boolean algebra. Other minimalist formalisms having the power of [set theory][330] include:
