        Some quotes from John Haugeland's *\`Artificial Intelligence: The Very Idea'* (1985), pp. 48-64.  

> They are __*token manipulation*__ games;  
> they are __*digital*__; and  
> they are __*finitely playable*__.

  Explanation:

__1.__  The __*tokens*__ ... are just the \`\`pieces'' (eg, *markers* or *counters*) with which the game is played. (Eg, chessmen, go stones, bits, 0s and Xs of tic-tac-toe).

__2. *Manipulating tokens*__ means one or more of the following:

-   *relocating* them ( eg, moving them around on some board)
-   *altering* them (or replacing them with different ones)
-   *adding new ones* to the position; and/or
-   *taking some away*.

__3__.  A __*digital system*__ is a set of __positive and reliable techniques__ (methods, devices) for __producing and reidentifying tokens__, or configurations of tokens, from some __prespecified set of types__.  
 

> A __*positive technique*__ is one that can succeed absolutely, totally and without qualification ... has the possibility of *succeeding perfectly*.
> 
> We can substitute \`\`__*writing*__'' and \`\`__*reading*__'' for \`\`*producing*'' and \`\`*reidentifying*'', but only with two warnings: (1) writing isn't just making pen or pencil marks, but rather any kind of __token manipulation__ that changes the formal position ... and (2) \`\`reading'' implies nothing about understanding (or even recognition) but only __differentiation by type and position__.  
>  

__4\. *Finitely playable*__ ... no infinite or magical powers required.  A finite player is assumed to have some __finite repertoire of specific primitive operations__ (e.g., move a chess piece, write a bit, read a bit) any __finite number of times__.
