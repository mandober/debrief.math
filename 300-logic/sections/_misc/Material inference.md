# Material inference - Wikipedia

In logic, inference is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true. In checking a logical inference for formal and material validity, the meaning of only its logical vocabulary and of both its logical and extra-logical vocabulary[clarification needed]
is considered, respectively.
In [logic][1], [inference][2] is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true. In checking a logical inference for __formal__ and __material__ validity, the meaning of only its logical vocabulary and of both its logical and extra-logical vocabulary\[*[clarification needed][3]*\] is considered, respectively.

## Examples\[[edit][4]\]

For example, the inference "*Socrates is a human, and each human must eventually die, therefore Socrates must eventually die*" is a formally valid inference; it remains valid if the nonlogical vocabulary "*Socrates*", "*is human*", and "*must eventually die*" is arbitrarily, but consistently replaced.[\[note 1\]][5]

In contrast, the inference "*Montreal is north of New York, therefore New York is south of Montreal*" is materially valid only; its validity relies on the extra-logical relations "*is north of*" and "*is south of*" being converse to each other.[\[note 2\]][6]

## Material inferences vs. enthymemes\[[edit][7]\]

Classical formal logic considers the above "north/south" inference as an [enthymeme][8], that is, as an incomplete inference; it can be made formally valid by supplementing the tacitly used conversity relationship explicitly: "*Montreal is north of New York, and whenever a location x is north of a location y, then y is south of x; therefore New York is south of Montreal*".

In contrast, the notion of a __material inference__ has been developed by [Wilfrid Sellars][9][\[1\]][10] in order to emphasize his view that such supplements are not necessary to obtain a correct argument.

## Brandom on material inference\[[edit][11]\]

### Non-monotonic inference\[[edit][12]\]

[Robert Brandom][13] adopted Sellars' view,[\[2\]][14] arguing that everyday (practical) reasoning is usually [non-monotonic][15], i.e. additional premises can turn a practically valid inference into an invalid one, e.g.

1.  "If I rub this [match][16] along the striking surface, then it will ignite." (*p*→*q*)
2.  "If *p*, but the match is inside a strong [electromagnetic field][17], then it will not ignite." (*p*∧*r*→¬*q*)
3.  "If *p* and *r*, but the match is in a [Faraday cage][18], then it will ignite." (*p*∧*r*∧*s*→*q*)
4.  "If *p* and *r* and *s*, but there is no [oxygen][19] in the room, then the match will not ignite." (*p*∧*r*∧*s*∧*t*→¬*q*)
5.  ...

Therefore, practically valid inference is different from formally valid inference (which is monotonic - the above argument that *Socrates must eventually die* cannot be challenged by whatever additional information), and should better be modelled by materially valid inference. While a classical logician could add a [ceteris paribus][20] clause to 1. to make it usable in formally valid inferences:

1.  "If I rub this match along the striking surface, then, ceteris paribus,[\[note 3\]][21] it will inflame."

However, Brandom doubts that the meaning of such a clause can be made explicit, and prefers to consider it as a hint to non-monotony rather than a miracle drug to establish monotony.

Moreover, the "match" example shows that a typical everyday inference can hardly be ever made formally complete. In a similar way, [Lewis Carroll][22]'s dialogue "*[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles][23]*" demonstrates that the attempt to make every inference fully complete can lead to an infinite regression.[\[3\]][24]

## See also\[[edit][25]\]

Material inference should not be confused with the following concepts, which refer to *formal*, not __material__ validity:

-   [Material conditional][26] — the logical connective "→" (i.e. "formally implies")
-   [Material implication (rule of inference)][27] — a rule for formally replacing "→" by "¬" (negation) and "∨" (disjunction)

## Notes\[[edit][28]\]

1.  __[^][29]__ A completely fictitious, but formally valid inference obtained by consistent replacement is e.g. "*Buckbeak is a unicorn, and each unicorn has gills, therefore Buckbeak has gills*".
2.  __[^][30]__ A completely fictitious, but materially (and formally) __in__valid inference obtained by consistent replacement is e.g. "*Hagrid is younger than Albus, therefore Albus is larger than Hagrid*". Consistent replacement doesn't respect conversity.
3.  __[^][31]__ [literally][32]: "*all other things being equal*"; here: "*assuming a typical situation*"
