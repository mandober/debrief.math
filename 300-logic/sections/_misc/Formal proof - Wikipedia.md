# Formal proof - Wikipedia

In logic and mathematics, a formal proof or derivation is a finite sequence of sentences (called well-formed formulas in the case of a formal language), each of which is an axiom, an assumption, or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a rule of inference. It differs from a natural language argument in that it is rigorous, unambiguous and mechanically verifiable.[1] If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a theorem of the formal system. The notion of theorem is not in general effective, therefore there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concepts of Fitch-style proof, sequent calculus and natural deduction are generalizations of the concept of proof.[2][3]
In [logic][1] and [mathematics][2], a __formal proof__ or __derivation__ is a finite [sequence][3] of [sentences][4] (called [well-formed formulas][5] in the case of a [formal language][6]), each of which is an [axiom][7], an assumption, or [follows from][8] the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [rule of inference][9]. It differs from a natural language argument in that it is rigorous, unambiguous and mechanically verifiable.[\[1\]][10] If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a [theorem][11] of the [formal system][12]. The notion of theorem is not in general [effective][13], therefore there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concepts of [Fitch-style proof][14], [sequent calculus][15] and [natural deduction][16] are [generalizations][17] of the concept of proof.[\[2\]][18][\[3\]][19]

The theorem is a [syntactic consequence][20] of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the [deductive apparatus][21] (of some formal system) to the previous well-formed formulas in the proof sequence.

Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in [interactive theorem proving][22] (e.g., through the use of [proof checker][23] and [automated theorem prover][24]).[\[4\]][25] Significantly, these proofs can be [checked automatically][26], also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of *finding* proofs ([automated theorem proving][27]) is usually [computationally intractable][28] and/or only [semi-decidable][29], depending upon the formal system in use.

## Background\[[edit][30]\]

### Formal language\[[edit][31]\]

A *formal language* is a [set][32] of finite [sequences][33] of [symbols][34]. Such a language can be defined without [reference][35] to any [meanings][36] of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [interpretation][37] is assigned to it – that is, before it has any meaning. Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages.

### Formal grammar\[[edit][38]\]

A *formal grammar* (also called *formation rules*) is a precise description of the [well-formed formulas][39] of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of [strings][40] over the [alphabet][41] of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their [semantics][42] (i.e. what they mean).

### Formal systems\[[edit][43]\]

A *formal system* (also called a *logical calculus*, or a *logical system*) consists of a formal language together with a [deductive apparatus][44] (also called a *deductive system*). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [transformation rules][45] (also called *inference rules*) or a set of [axioms][46], or have both. A formal system is used to [derive][47] one expression from one or more other expressions.

### Interpretations\[[edit][48]\]

An *interpretation* of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called [formal semantics][49]. *Giving an interpretation* is synonymous with *constructing a [model][50].*
