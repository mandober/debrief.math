Logic Self-Taught: A Workbook

[Katarzyna.Paprzycka@swps.edu.pl][1]

*Logic Self-Taught* is addressed to anyone who answers at least one of the following questions positivitely:

¨ Do you like puzzles (logical puzzles, crossword puzzles etc.)?

¨ Have you ever felt that you understood everything in a logic class or in a logic textbook but you were completely helpless in a logic test?

¨ Do you have more of a hate\- than a love-relationship with mathematical symbols?

What USM students said about the logic on-line course . . .
