# Logical graph - Wikipedia

A logical graph is a special type of diagrammatic structure in any one of several systems of graphical syntax that Charles Sanders Peirce developed for logic.
A __logical [graph][1]__ is a special type of diagrammatic structure in any one of several systems of graphical [syntax][2] that [Charles Sanders Peirce][3] developed for [logic][4].

In his papers on *[qualitative logic][5]*, *[entitative graphs][6]*, and *[existential graphs][7]*, Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [formalism][8], or a graph-theoretic [formal language][9], designed to be interpreted for logic.

In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures.
