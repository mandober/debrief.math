# List of laws in logic

- *the law of identity*             (ID)
  - everything is (identical to itself)
  - B.Russell in PM, 1912: "Whatever is, is."
  - every proposition implies itself,            p -> p
  - [Law of identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_identity)
  - <kbd>ID</kbd>
  - axiom of classical logic
  - axiom of intuitionistic logic

- *the law of non-contradiction*    (NC)
  - no proposition is both true and false,     ¬(p ∧ ¬p)
  - contradictory statements cannot both at the same time be true
  - no thing having some quality has the negative of that quality
  - [Law of non-contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction)
  - <kbd>NC</kbd>
  - axiom of classical logic
  - axiom of intuitionistic logic

- *the law of the excluded middle*      (EM)
  - every proposition is either true or false,   p ∨ ¬p
  - a thing either has some quality or has the negative of that quality
  - [Law of excluded middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle)
  - <kbd>EM</kbd>
  - axiom of classical logic
  - not an axiom of intuitionistic logic (also double negation elimination)

- *The principle of Explosion* ECQ
Because the principle has been falsely attributed to philosopher John Duns Scotus (1265-1308), the principle is sometimes known as **pseudo Scotus** (PSP).

* the law of simplification
* Peirce's law
