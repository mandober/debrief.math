# Propositional logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus

* Propositional logic is a branch of logic that primarily studies methods of combining atomic statements using logical connectives in order to form compoud statements. Atomic statements are connective-free formulas consisting of propositional variables or logical constants (true, false, ⟙, ⟘).

* Propositional variables (`p`, `q`, `r`, etc.) represent direct translations of declarative atomic sentences from a natural language. For example, `p` may stand for "it's cold outside", and `q` for "I wear my coat", and they may be combined, e.g. using the connective for implication, `->`, to form the compound statement "if it's cold outside, then I wear my coat", symbolized by `p -> q`.

* Atomic statements are called propositions and, generally, they are called formulas, that is, well-defined formulas (wffs). In order to interpret a wff, all the distinct variables in the formula have to be assigned a truth value (apart from logical constants, which already have a truth value). *Valuation* is a function that maps propositional variables to truth values. Truth values are compositional: the value of a compound expression depends only on the truth values of its atomic components.
