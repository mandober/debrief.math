# Introduction to logic

* Only *declarative sentences* from natural languages can be assigned a *truth value* and thus translated into a symbolic formal language of logic (where an argument maintains the same form but is expressed differently).

* An *argument* is a set of statements, called *premises*, assembled with intention to derive the truth value of the final statement, called *conclusion*.

* *Logic* studies *arguments* and *argumentative forms of reasoning*, and it is concerned with the development of standards and criteria to *evaluate arguments*, the processes referred to as *inference rules*.

* *Formally defined arguments* are constructed in, e.g. mathematics, independently of any concrete natural language.

* The *logical form* of an argument can be translated from a natural into a symbolic language.

* All *systems of logic* have a *formal language* used to write *logical statements* or *propositions*.

* A proposition is expressed as a logical *formula*, consisting of *atomic formulas*, such as *logical constants* (`true` or `⟙`, `false` or `⟘`) and *logical variables* (`p`, `q`, `r`, …), and *compound formulas* that are build from atoms and *logical connectives* (`¬`, `∧`, `∨`, `→`, …).


Normally, all formulas have some intended interpretation. For example, a formula may assert a true property about the natural numbers, or some property that must be true in a data base. This implies that a formula has a well-defined meaning or semantics.

But how do we define this meaning precisely? In logic, we usually define the meaning of a formula as its truth value. A formula can be either true (or valid) or false.

Defining rigorously the notion of truth is actually not as obvious as it appears. We shall present a concept of truth due to Tarski.

Roughly speaking, a formula is true if it is satisfied in all possible interpretations.
