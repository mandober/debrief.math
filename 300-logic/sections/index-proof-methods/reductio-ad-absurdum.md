# Reductio ad absurdum

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum

In logic, reductio ad absurdum (RAA) is the form of argument that attempts to establish a claim by showing that the opposite scenario would lead to absurdity or a logical contradiction.

This argument form traces back to Ancient Greek philosophy and has been used throughout history in both formal mathematical and philosophical reasoning, as well as in debate.

The "absurd" conclusion of RAA argument can take a range of forms:    
(1) Earth cannot be flat; otherwise, we would find people falling off the edge. 
(2) There is no smallest positive rational number because, if there were, then it could be divided by two to get a smaller one.

The first example argues that denial of the premise would result in a ridiculous conclusion, against the evidence of our senses.

The second example is a mathematical *proof by contradiction* (indirect proof)that argues that the denial of the premise would result in a logical contradiction.

## Principle of non-contradiction

Aristotle clarified the connection between *contradiction* and *falsity* in his principle of non-contradiction, which states that a proposition cannot be both true and false, `p` and `¬p` cannot both be true, `¬(p ⋀ ¬p)`.

Therefore, if a proposition and its negation can both be derived logically from a premise, it can be concluded that the premise is false. This technique, known as indirect proof or proof by contradiction, has formed the basis of reductio ad absurdum arguments in formal fields such as logic and mathematics.
