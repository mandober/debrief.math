# Logical equivalence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_equivalence

Two wffs, p and q, are said to be logically equivalent if they have the same truth value in every model.

Depending on the notation, the logical equivalence of p and q can be expressed as `p ≡ q`, `p :: q`, `Epq`, or `p ⟺ q`.

However, these symbols are also used for [material equivalence][1], so proper interpretation would depend on the context. Logical equivalence is different from material equivalence, although the two concepts are intrinsically related.
