# Soundness

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness

In logic, more precisely in deductive reasoning, an argument is **sound** if it is both valid in form and its premises are true.

> Soundness also has a related meaning in mathematical logic, wherein logical systems are sound iff every formula that can be proved in the system is logically valid with respect to the semantics of the system.


## Soundness (interactive proof)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness_(interactive_proof)

Soundness is a property of interactive proof systems that requires that no prover can make the verifier accept for a wrong statement `y âˆ‰ L`, except with some small probability. The upper bound of this probability is referred to as the soundness error of a proof system.
