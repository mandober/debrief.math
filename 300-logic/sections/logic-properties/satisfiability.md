# Satisfiability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability

In mathematical logic, satisfiability and validity are elementary concepts of *semantics*.

A formula is **satisfiable** if it is possible to find an interpretation (model) that makes the formula true.

A formula is valid if all interpretations make the formula true.

The opposites of these concepts are *unsatisfiability* and *invalidity*, that is, a formula is unsatisfiable if none of the interpretations make the formula true, and invalid if some such interpretation makes the formula false. These 4 concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to Aristotle's *square of opposition*.

The 4 concepts can be raised to apply to whole theories: a theory is satisfiable (valid) if one (all) of the interpretations make each of the axioms of the theory true, and a theory is unsatisfiable (invalid) if all (one) of the interpretations make each of the axioms of the theory false.

It is also possible to consider only interpretations that make all of the axioms of a second theory true. This generalization is commonly called *satisfiability modulo theories*.

The question whether a sentence in propositional logic is satisfiable is *decidable*.

The question whether a sentence in first-order logic is satisfiable is *not decidable*.

In universal algebra and equational theory, the methods of term rewriting, congruence closure and unification are used to attempt to decide satisfiability. Whether a particular theory is decidable depends on many factors (such as whether the theory is variable-free).
