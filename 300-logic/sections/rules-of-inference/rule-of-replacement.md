# Rule of replacement

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_replacement

A **rule of replacement** is a *transformation rule* that may be applied to only a particular segment of an expression.

A logical system may be constructed so that it uses either axioms, rules of inference, or both as transformation rules for logical expressions in the system.

Whereas a rule of inference is always applied to a whole logical expression, a rule of replacement may be applied to only a particular segment.

Within the context of a logical proof, logically equivalent expressions may replace each other.

Rules of replacement are used in propositional logic to manipulate propositions.

Common rules of replacement include:
- logical equivalence
- de Morgan's laws
- commutation
- association
- distribution
- double negation (not in IL)
- transposition
- material implication
- exportation
- tautology
