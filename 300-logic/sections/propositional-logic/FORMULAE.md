# Formulae of propositional logic

A formal language of propositional logic consists of *logical variables* (p, q, r, …), that range over the domain 𝔹, which consists of the *logical constants* true and false (or ⟙ and ⟘), and *logical connectives* (⋀, ⋁, ¬, …) that connect *atomic statements* in order to build *compound statements*.
