# Mathematical Logic

*Mathematical logic* is a formal system consisting of axioms and inference rules: by repeatedly applying the inference rules to the axioms (and to the previously derived theorems), new theorems can be one derived within the system.

For example, the definition of the natural numbers by *Peano axioms*: zero is a natural number; each natural number has a successor which is also a natural number. Therefore, starting with 0 and repeatedly applying the successor function we can generate a list of natural numbers (the new theorem).

Mathematical logic studies and builds theorems about a system of objects, only the objects it deals with are the theorems themselves and the system of objects is the entire mathematics.

Mathematical logic studies the application of technics of formal logic to math, explores formal systems of deductive reasoning in formal proof systems.

Mathematical logic is closely associated to metamathematics, foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science.

The aim of logic in CS is to develop formal languages that can model concepts so we can reason about these models by constructing valid arguments, which can be rigorously defended and proved, and, preferably mechanically, checked for correctness.

## Mathematical Logic

* Mathematical logic began towards the end of the last century when Frege developed what is now the predicate calculus.

* Mathematical logic involves applying standard mathematical methods to the study of systems that themselves can be used to formalize mathematics. The apparent circularity is overcome by distinguishing between the object language, in which the formal system is expressed, and the meta-language in which properties of the formal system are expressed and reasoned about.

* The basic components of logic are propositions. Propositions are used to express beliefs. In a natural language they are represented by declarative sesentences whose truth value may be discussed.

* The notion of belief is a general one, but different logics take different stances about the way beliefs may be manipulated and reasoned about. For example, classical logic restricts contradictory beliefs.

* The importance of formalization stems from the fact once a particular theory is formalized, reasoning in it may be carried out purely through symbolic manipulation, without the need to refer to its semantics.
