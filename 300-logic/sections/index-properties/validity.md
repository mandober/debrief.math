# Validity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic)

≝ A argument is **valid** iff it takes the form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false; otherwise, the argument is **invalid**.

A argument is *sound* iff it is both valid, and all of its premises are actually true. Otherwise, a deductive argument is unsound.

An argument is **valid** iff it has the form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false. Whether the premises are actually true or not is unimportant - the important thing is that the conclusion follows from the premises on the basis of the syntactic structure of the argument alone.

(Commonly, the word "deductive" is dropped from the terms "deductively valid", "deductive argument", etc.)

Alternative definitions of the concept of deductive validity.   
An argument is valid if…
* …the truth of the premises forces the truth of conclusion.
* …the premises cannot be true without the conclusion also being true.
* …the conclusion follows with certainty from the premises.
* …it would be inconsistent for the premises to be true and yet the conclusion to be false still.
* …there is no counterexample, i.e. a possible situation that makes all the premises true but the conclusion false.



Valid arguments must be clearly expressed by means of formulas called *well-formed formulas*. The validity of an argument can be scrutinezed (in order to be proved or disproved), but the proof depends only on its logical form.

A formula is:
- *satisfiable* if there is an interpretation that makes it true.
- *unsatisfiable* if none of the interpretations make it true.
- *valid* if it is true under every interpretation.
- *invalid* if an interpretation makes it false.

Satisfiability and validity are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to the *square of opposition*:

A formula is satisfiable if it is true under at least one interpretation, thus
* __tautology__ 
  is a formula whose negation is unsatisfiable.
* __contradiction__
  is an unsatisfiable formula, both through negation and affirmation.
* __contingency__ 
  is formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.



Deductive arguments are evaluated in terms of their validity and soundness. An argument is *valid* if it is impossible for its premises to be true while its conclusion is false. In other words, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. An argument can be valid even if one or more of its premises are false. An argument is *sound* if it is valid and the premises are true.




**An argument form (schema) is valid** if every argument of that logical form is valid.

Arguments in which the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion are *valid arguments*.

Arguments in which the truth of the premises makes the truth of the conclusion likely, but not certain, are called *inductively strong arguments*.

These two properties, validity and inductive strength, have given rise to deductive and inductive logic, respectively.

Arguments that are valid and have true premises are called **sound arguments**. Not all valid arguments are sound since some of their premises could be false, but **any sound argument is necessarily valid**.
