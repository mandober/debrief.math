# Logic

Logic is considered a branch of philosophy and mathematics, and by extension from math, of computer science as well.

The broad field of logic is slightly narrowed down by it belonging to one of these sciences, so the mathematical logic is primarily concerned with ...

Already this shows the multi-faceted aspect of logic, which, as it turns out, is probably a discipline with the biggest number of divisions.

Almost every concievable feature of logic is a splitting point that a time and again forks the systems of logic into two groups: the systems that admit that feature and the systems that reject it. Frequently, these breaking points are not binary, but admit more granular interpretations, each a class of its own, contributing to the exponential growth of logic systems.

The major divisions of logic systems are done across orthogonal lines. The classification of logic system escapes a hierarchical format, with many orthognal dimensions intersected by a numerous levels and classes and subclasses.

However, for most of the history, the noun "logic" lacked a plural form. What we today call the (a?, ∅?) classical logic was the only system of logic in existence.

Considering the level of exposure of logical statements, this was a time of investigations at a macro level, since the granuallarity by which the logical statments could be studied was coarse. Syllogisms of the Syllogistic logic could only take the entire sentences into account.

One of the primary divisions of logic is into two opposed approaches that broadly qualify logic systems as classical or intuitionistic.

The most important distinguishing feature pertaining to classical logic is that it admits a strictly bivalent notion of truth. As far as classical logic is concerned, there are only two truth values, true and false, and any logical statement can either be true or false. Moreover, a statement must necessarily have one of these two truth values - it cannot be unknown or anything else apart from true or false. Also, a statement must have only a single truth value - it cannot be both true and false. In brief, in classical logic a statement is either true or false, not both and not neither.

Besides bivalence, classical logic
