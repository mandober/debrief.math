# About Logic

* Logic is the formal science of reasoning, whose object of study is the truth itself.

* Logic investigates and classifies the structure of statements and arguments through the study of formal systems and the associated rules of inference, as well as the study of arguments in a natural language setting.

* The scope of logic is very large, ranging from core topics such as the study of fallacies and paradoxes, to specialized analyses of reasoning such as probability, correct reasoning and argumentation.

* An aim of logic is the identification of the valid rules of inferences.
* Logicians study the criteria for the evaluation of arguments.
