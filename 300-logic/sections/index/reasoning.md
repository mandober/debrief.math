## Types of reasoning

1. Deductive reasoning
2. Inductive reasoning
3. Abductive reasoning
4. Analogical reasoning
5. Cause-and-effect reasoning
6. Critical thinking
7. Decompositional reasoning


## Analogical reasoning

Analogical reasoning is a form of thinking that finds similarities between two or more things and then uses those characteristics to find other qualities common to them. It's based on the brain's tendency to notice patterns and make associations. Once the brain recognizes a pattern, it can associate the pattern with specific things, and this leads to analogous reasoning. Analogous thinking can help you expand your understanding by looking for similarities between different things.

A supermarket has served as an analogical source for many businesses. When planning a new business, evaluating how to serve customers better, or planning a new line, many business strategists reach for a supermarket analogy to ask if they can provide everything a customer may need when shopping for items in their category.


## Cause-and-effect reasoning

Cause-and-effect reasoning is a type of thinking in which you show the linkage between two events. This reasoning is used to explain what may happen if an action takes place or why things happen when some conditions are present. This type of reasoning commonly guides everyday decision-making, in cases where people draw on personal experience and a desire to improve. Businesses and professionals also use prediction and forecast modeling. This type of reasoning can help people trust your arguments, especially if you are accurate most of the time.

For instance, a marketing agency may use cause-and-effect reasoning to prove the value of their campaigns and request an increase in budget. They may show how in the first year they launched an advertising campaign for a product line before Christmas, and the product sales increased 10%. The following year, they increased the advertising budget 15%, and the product sales increased 25%. Therefore, with a budget increase of 20%, they're expecting a sales increase of 30%.

## Critical thinking

Critical thinking involves extensive rational thought about a specific subject in order to come to a definitive conclusion. It's helpful in fields such as computing, engineering, social sciences and logic. Critical thinking plays a vital role in problem-solving, especially when troubleshooting technical issues. It's used to assess the authenticity of works of arts, literature, films and other artistic expressions. Critical thinking also plays a vital role in mental and emotional matters, gray areas and other fields that deal with subjects less understood.

For example, the general manager of a family restaurant hears that a bakery important to their supply chain is about to go on strike. They order extra baked goods to freeze and then plans a distributor they can use during the strike.


## Decompositional reasoning

Decompositional reasoning is the process of breaking things into constituent parts to understand the function of each component and how it contributes to the operation of the item as a whole. By analyzing each part independently, decompositional reasoning allows an observer to draw powerful conclusions about the whole. You find this approach in several disciplines, including science, engineering, marketing, product development, game development and software development.

Project management utilizes decompositional reasoning in its division of a project into components. A manager assigns each component to an individual, who is responsible for completion and communication about integration into the project. This division ensures the success of each component and contributes to the operation of the whole.
