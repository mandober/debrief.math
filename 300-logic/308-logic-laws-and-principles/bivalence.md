## The principle of bivalence

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Principle_of_bivalence

* The principle of bivalence (POB) states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition has exactly one truth value, either true or false, not both and not neither.

* A logic that admits the BOP is called bivalent or two-valued logic.

* The BOP is the defining characteristic of classical logics.

* In formal logic, the BOP becomes a property of semantics - a given semantics may or may not possess it.

* Bivalence is not the same as the LEM; there are logics that recognize LEM without being bivalent.

* The BOP is related to LEM, although LEM is a syntactic expression, having the form `p ⋁ ¬p`, that pertains to a formal logic's language. For example, the three-valued logic of paradox admits LEM, but not the LNC, i.e. `¬(p ⋀ ¬p)`, and its intended semantics is not bivalent.

In *classical two-valued logic* both the law of excluded middle and the law of non-contradiction hold.

Many modern logic programming systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of **negation as failure (NAF)**.
