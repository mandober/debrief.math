# Löwenheim-Skolem theorem

In mathematical logic, the **Löwenheim-Skolem theorem** is a theorem on the existence and cardinality of models, named after Leopold Löwenheim and Thoralf Skolem. It implies that if a *countable first-order theory* has an *infinite model*, then for every infinite cardinal number `κ` it has a model of size `κ`, and that no first-order theory with an infinite model can have a *unique model* up to isomorphism. As a consequence, first-order theories are unable to control the cardinality of their infinite models.

The *(downward) Löwenheim-Skolem theorem* is one of the two key properties, along with the *compactness theorem*, that are used in *Lindström's theorem* to characterize first-order logic. In general, the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem does not hold in stronger logics such as second-order logic.
