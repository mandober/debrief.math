# Logical form

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_form

*Logical form* of a statement is a precisely-specified semantic version of that statement in a *formal system*. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly ambiguous statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous *logical interpretation* with respect to a formal system. In an ideal *formal language*, the meaning of a logical form can be determined unambiguously from syntax alone. Logical forms are semantic, not syntactic constructs; therefore, there may be more than one string that represents the same logical form in a given language. The logical form of an *argument* is called the *argument form* of the argument.
