# Non-logical symbol

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-logical_symbol

In logic, the formal languages used to create expressions consist of symbols, which can be broadly divided into *constants* and *variables*. The constants of a language can further be divided into *logical symbols* and *non-logical symbols* (sometimes also called logical and non-logical constants).

symbols:
- logical variables
- logical constants
  - logical symbols/constants
  - non-logical symbols/constants
    - predicates and individual constants (FOL)

Language of first-order logic
- logical symbols
  - logical connectives
  - quantifiers
  - logical variables
- non-logical symbols

    - predicates
    - individual constants
    - variables
    - functions


The non-logical symbols of a language of first-order logic consist of predicates and individual constants. These include symbols that, in an interpretation, may stand for individual constants, variables, functions, or predicates.

A language of first-order logic is a formal language over the alphabet consisting of its non-logical symbols and its logical symbols. The latter include logical connectives, quantifiers, and variables that stand for statements.

> A non-logical symbol only has meaning or semantic content when one is assigned to it by means of an interpretation.

Consequently, a sentence containing a non-logical symbol lacks meaning except under an interpretation, so a sentence is said to be true or false under an interpretation.

> The logical constants, by definition, have the same meaning in all interpretations.

They include the symbols for truth-functional connectives (such as "and", "or", "not", "implies", and logical equivalence) and the symbols for the quantifiers.

The equality symbol is sometimes treated as a non-logical symbol and sometimes treated as a symbol of logic. If it is treated as a logical symbol, then any interpretation will be required to interpret the equality sign using true equality; if interpreted as a non-logical symbol, it may be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation.
