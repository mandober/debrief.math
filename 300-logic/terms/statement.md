# Statement

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(logic)

Logic is the study of reasoning, but in order to study it, logic must analyse and codify the though process of human reasoning in order to model it and recognize the patterns that underline it. However, it cannot deal with intrinsic thought patterns as they happen in the mind - it can only observe how they are translated and expressed in a language.

Since it starts with a natural language, perhaps the language of logic itself could also be expressed in one. It turns out this is not possible because natural languages undergo a dynamic, organic development and this process always results in ambiguities - every natural language is more-less ambiguous. However, a language of logic needs to be a formal language, free of ambiguity. Moreover, the content of sentences of a natural language is of no importance, since logic is only intereseted in the form and relations of sentences not in their particular contents. The content of sentences is best replaced by variables so that the pure form stands out.

This means the sentences of a natural language are translated into a formal language of logic. However, not all sentences are amenable to this translation - only *declarative sentences* are translatable into logical statements.

A *logical statement* is the translation of a declarative sentence, from a natural language, into the symbols that make up the formal language of logic. Declarative sentences, are hence statements, are sentences of particular form that allows assigning them a *truth value*. Said differently, we can argue about the truth value of declarative sentences. We can argue about their truth value.
