# Domain of discourse

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse

In the formal sciences, the **domain of discourse**, also called the *universe of discourse*, *universal set*, or simply *universe*, is the set of entities over which certain variables of interest in some formal treatment may range.

The domain of discourse is usually identified in the preliminaries, so that there is no need in the further treatment to specify each time the range of the relevant variables.

For example, in an interpretation of first-order logic, the domain of discourse is the set of individuals over which the quantifiers range.

A naked proposition without the domain of discourse specified would be ambiguous in most cases.

The term "universe of discourse" generally refers to the collection of objects being discussed in a specific discourse. In model-theoretical semantics, a universe of discourse is the set of entities that a model is based on.
