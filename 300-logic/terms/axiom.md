# Axiom

https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Axiom

In logic, 

An axiom (postulate) is an assumption in a *logical argument* from which *premises* can be fed, implications derived.

Different sets of axioms being used are called "logical branches".

Classical logic, founded around 350 BCE by Aristotle, has 3 axioms:
- The law of identity: A = A, that is, A is identical to itself
- The law of non-contradiction, `¬(A ∧ ¬A)`, i.e. `A` is mutually exclusive with `¬A`
- The law of the excluded middle, `A ∨ ¬A`, i.e. everything is either true or not true, with no graduations of truth values.

Branches of logic exist which add axioms or remove them. Some axioms, called *presuppositions*, are actually just premises in disguise, which are typically implicitly stated like an axiom is.
