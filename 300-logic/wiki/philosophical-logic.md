In a wider sense, Philosophical Logic is conceived as the study of the scope and nature of logic in general. In this sense, Philosophical Logic can be seen as identical to the Philosophy of Logic that tries to define logic and also explores fundamental concepts of logic.

In a narrow sense, **Philosophical Logic** is the area of philosophy that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems, often in the form of *extended logics* (such as modal logic). This article treats Philosophical Logic in the narrow sense, in which it forms its own field of inquiry within the Philosophy of Logic.

An important issue for Philosophical Logic is the question of *how to classify the great variety of non-classical logical systems*. One form of classification is to distinguish between *extended logics* and *deviant logics*.

Logic itself can be defined as the study of valid inference.

**Classical logic** is the dominant form of logic based on the so-called *3 Laws of Thought*: The Law of Identity (ID), The Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC), The Law of Excluded Middle (LEM). It also admits The Principle of Bivalence (POB), and The Double Negation Elimination (DNE). ID is present in all logics. LNC is absent in paraconsistent logics. LEM and DNE are not admitted in intuitionistic logic (IL). POB assumes two truth values but some logics don't agree (multi-valued logics, fuzzy logics).

However, classical logic is the defult logic as it behaves in accordance with assumptions shared by many - even though these assumptions do not make the most basic set of possible assumptions; e.g. LEM assumes a truth value can always be determined (which is not always the case), that the negation of truth is falsehood and vice versa, that the double negation of truth is falsehood and vice versa - which are all very strong and unnecessary assumptions to make initially. It is better to only add them when required, the way IL does. In fact, many other logic systems are better fits as the fundamental logic to classical logic.

**Extended logics** are logical systems that extend classical logic to new fields, introducing new logical symbols and the corresponding rules of inference governing these symbols.

In the case of *alethic modal logic*, these new symbols are used to express not just what is true simpliciter, but also *what is possibly or necessarily true*.

It is often combined with *possible worlds semantics*, which holds that a proposition is possibly true if it is true in some possible world, while it is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds.

**Deontic logic** pertains to ethics and provides a formal treatment of ethical notions, such as obligation and permission.

**Temporal logic** formalizes temporal relations between propositions. This includes ideas like whether something is true at some time or all the time, and whether it is true in the future or in the past.

**Epistemic logic** belongs to epistemology. It can be used to express not just what is the case but also what someone *believes or knows* to be the case. Its rules of inference articulate what follows from the fact that someone has these kinds of mental states.

**Higher-order logics** do not directly apply classical logic to certain new subfields within philosophy, but generalize it by allowing quantification not just over individuals but also over predicates.



**Deviant logics**, in contrast to these forms of extended logics, reject some of the fundamental principles of classical logic and are often seen as its rivals.

**Intuitionistic logic** is based on the idea that truth depends on verification through a proof. This leads it to reject certain rules of inference found in classical logic that are not compatible with this assumption (i.e. LEM, DNE).

**Free logic** modifies classical logic in order to avoid existential presuppositions associated with the use of possibly empty singular terms, like names and definite descriptions.

**Many-valued logics** allow additional truth values besides true and false. They thereby reject the principle of bivalence of truth.

**Paraconsistent logics** are logical systems able to deal with *contradictions*. They do so by avoiding the *principle of explosion* found in classical logic.

**Relevance logic** is a prominent form of paraconsistent logic. It rejects the purely truth-functional interpretation of the *material conditional* by introducing the additional requirement of relevance: for the conditional to be true, its antecedent has to be relevant to its consequent.
