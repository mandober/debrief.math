*Trivialism* or *logical nihilism* is the logical theory that all propositions are true and that all contradictions of the form `P ∧ ¬P` (e.g. the ball is red and not red) are true. In accordance with this, a trivialist is a person who believes everything is true.

In classical logic, trivialism is in direct violation of Aristotle's law of noncontradiction (LNC). In philosophy, trivialism is considered by some to be the complete opposite of skepticism. Paraconsistent logics may use "the law of non-triviality" to abstain from trivialism in logical practices that involve true contradictions.

Theoretical arguments and anecdotes have been offered for trivialism to contrast it with theories such as modal realism, dialetheism and paraconsistent logics.
