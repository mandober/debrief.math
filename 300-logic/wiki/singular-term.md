# Singular term

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_term

A singular term is a paradigmatic referring device in a language. Singular terms are of philosophical importance for philosophy of language because they refer to things in the world, and the ability of words to refer calls for scrutiny.

>**Singular terms** are defined as expressions that purport to denote or designate particular individual people, places, or other objects.

Singular terms contrast with **general terms** (e.g. "car", "chair") which can apply to more than one thing.

There are various *kinds of singular terms*:
- proper names ("Matthew")
- definite descriptions ("the second fisherman in the boat")
- singular personal pronouns ("she")
- demonstrative pronouns ("this")
- etc.



Historically, various *definitions of singular term* have been offered:

- A term that tells us *which individual* is being talked about (John Stuart Mill, Arthur Prior, P. F. Strawson)

- A term that is grammatically singular (William of Ockham)
  - a *proper name*, 'proprium nomen'
  - a *demonstrative pronoun*, 'pronomen demonstrativum'
  - a *demonstrative pronoun* with a common name, 'cum termino communi'

- A term that is inherently about the object to which it applies or refers. (Frege)

- A term that is true "in the same sense" of only one object. (Peter of Spain)
