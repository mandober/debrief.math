# Vacuous truth

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth

In mathematics and logic, a **vacuous truth** is a conditional or universal statement (any universal statement that can be converted to a conditional statement) that is true because the antecedent cannot be satisfied.

These are all vacuously true (under certain conditions)
- All C are O.
- All C are ¬O.
- All C are O and all C are ¬O.

For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" is true even when there are no cell phones are in the room. In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned on" is also vacuously true, as is the conjunction of the two statements: "all cell phones in the room are turned on and turned off", which would otherwise be incoherent and false. For that reason, it is sometimes said that a statement is vacuously true because it does not really say anything.
