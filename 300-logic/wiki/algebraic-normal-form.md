# Algebraic normal form

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_normal_form

In Boolean algebra, **algebraic normal form (ANF)** is a way of writing propositional logic formulas in one of three subforms:


- The entire formula is purely true or false: 1, 0
- One or more variables are combined into a term by AND (∧), then one or more terms are combined by XOR (⊕) together into ANF. Negations are not permitted: 

    a ⊕ b ⊕ (a ∧ b) ⊕ (a ∧ b ∧ c)

The previous subform with a purely true term: 

    1 ⊕ a ⊕ b ⊕ (a ∧ b) ⊕ (a ∧ b ∧ c)

Formulas written in ANF are also known as
- Algebraic normal form (ANF)
- Ring sum normal form (RSNF or RNF)
- Zhegalkin polynomials (Zhegalkin normal form)
- Positive Polarity (or Parity) Reed-Muller expressions (PPRM) (or RM expansion)
