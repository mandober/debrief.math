# Truth-bearer

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-bearer

A **truth-bearer** is an entity that is said to be either true or false and nothing else.

The thesis that some things are true while others are false has led to different theories about the nature of these entities.

Since there is divergence of opinion on the matter, the term truth-bearer is used to be neutral among the various theories.

Truth-bearer candidates include
- propositions
- sentences
- sentence-tokens
- statements
- beliefs
- thoughts
- intuitions
- utterances
- judgements

but different authors exclude one or more of these; deny their existence; argue that they are true only in a derivative sense; assert or assume that the terms are synonymous; or avoid addressing their distinction.

## Introduction

The terminology used is not always used in the ways set out, and it is introduced solely for the purposes of discussion in this article.

Use is made of the *type-token* and *use-mention* distinctions. Reflection on *occurrences of numerals* might be helpful. Grammar recognizes 4 types of sentences: interrogative, declarative, exclamative and imperative. In logic, only *declarative sentences* are considered to have truth value, called *propositions* (but not even all declarative sentences are suitable).

- Presuppositions:
  - glyph  : any symbol
  - glyphs : symbol+ "-ax::;c  ., /"
  - delim  : space, comma, period, colon, semi-colon, dash
  - delims : delim+
  - grp    : " ' ( ) [ ]
  - grps   : matching, balanced pair of grp
  - string: sequence of glyphs (any: chars, puncts, space, delims, â€¦)
  - pattern of characters (poc) or word: sequence of delim-separated strings
  - word: delim-separated sequence of chars
  - words: word+


- Elements:
  - character
  - pattern of characters (poc)
  - word-token
  - word-type
  - meaningful-word-token
  - word-meaning


"This toucan can catch a can"
- 1 poc
- 6 word-tokens
- 5 word-types since ('can' occurrs twice)
- 6 word-meanings

"He is grnd"
- 1 poc
- 3 word-tokens


A **character** is an element of an alphabet. It is a typographic character (printed or written), a unit of speech, a phoneme, a series of dots and dashes (as sounds, magnetic pulses, printed or written), a flag or stick held at a certain angle, a gesture, a sign in sign language, a pattern or raised indentation (in brail), and other such similar signs. (Here, a char is seemingly only an alphabetic symbol; other symbols, like 'space', are not explained).

* pattern of characters: sequence of delim-separated strings

* **word-token**: (delimiter-separated) pattern of characters
* **word-type**: distinct pattern of characters.
* **meaningful-word-token**: word-token with associated meaning.
* **word-meaning**: possibly distinct poc with the same meaning.

: raw "words", space-separated poc

  - word-type: identical poc's; 'can' (be able) and 'can' (container)
  - meaningful-word-token
  - word-meaning: word-types with distinct meaning


Two word-tokens with the same meaning are counted as one word-meaning.

Only those word-tokens which are meaningful-word-tokens can have the same meaning as another word-token.

The pattern of characters "This toucan can catch a can" contains 6 *word-meanings*. Although it contains only 5 *word-type*, the 2 occurrences of the *word-token* 'can' have different meanings. 

Assuming 'bucket' and 'pail' mean the same, the pattern of characters "If you have a bucket, then you have a pail" contains 10 word-tokens, 7 word-types, 6 word-meanings.



A **sentence-token** is a pattern of word-tokens. 

A **meaningful-sentence-token** is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens. Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of *word-tokens characters*

A **declarative-sentence-token** is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.[nb 9] 

A **meaningful-declarative-sentence-token** is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token[nb 10] Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type[nb 11] if they are identical patterns of word-tokens. 

A nonsense-declarative-sentence-token[nb 12] is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token. 

A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use[nb 13] occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively.

A referring-expression[nb 14] is expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity. 

A referential success[nb 15] is a referring-expression's success in identifying a particular entity. 

A referential failure[nb 16] is a referring-expression's failure to identify a particular entity. 

A referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use[nb 17] is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity.
