# Lindström's theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindstr%C3%B6m%27s_theorem

In mathematical logic, **Lindström's theorem** (named after Swedish logician Per Lindström, who published it in 1969) states that first-order logic is the strongest logic (satisfying certain conditions, e.g. closure under classical negation) having both the *(countable) compactness property* and the *(downward) Löwenheim-Skolem property*.

Lindström's theorem is perhaps the best known result of what later became known as *abstract model theory*, the basic notion of which is an *abstract logic*; the more general notion of an *institution* was later introduced, which advances from a set-theoretical notion of model to a category-theoretical one.

Lindström had previously obtained a similar result in studying first-order logics extended with *Lindström quantifiers*.

Lindström's theorem has been extended to various other systems of logic, in particular, modal logics by Johan van Benthem and Sebastian Enqvist.
