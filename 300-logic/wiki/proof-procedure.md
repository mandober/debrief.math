# Proof procedure

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_procedure


In logic, and in particular proof theory, a proof procedure for a given logic is a systematic method for producing proofs in some proof calculus of (provable) statements.

## Types of proof calculi

There are several types of proof calculi. The most popular are natural deduction, sequent calculi (i.e., Gentzen type systems), Hilbert systems, and semantic tableaux or trees.

A given proof procedure will target a specific proof calculus, but can be reformulated so as to produce proofs in other proof styles as well.

## Completeness

>A proof procedure for a logic is *complete* if it produces a proof for each provable statement.

The theorems of logical systems are typically recursively enumerable, which implies the existence of a complete but extremely inefficient proof procedure; however, a proof procedure is only of interest if it is reasonably efficient.

Faced with an unprovable statement, a complete proof procedure may sometimes succeed in detecting and signalling its unprovability.

In the general case, where provability is a semidecidable property, this is not possible, and instead the procedure will diverge (not terminate).
