# Philosophy of logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_logic

**Philosophy of logic** is the area of philosophy that studies the scope and nature of logic. It investigates the philosophical problems raised by logic, such as the *presuppositions* often implicitly at work in theories of logic and in their application. Philosophy of logic involves questions about how logic is to be defined and how different logical systems relate to each other. It includes the study of the nature of the fundamental concepts used by logic and the relation of logic to other disciplines.

According to a common characterization, *philosophical logic* is the part of the philosophy of logic that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems, often in the form of extended logical systems like modal logic.

However some theorists draw the distinction between the philosophy of logic and philosophical logic differently or not at all.

**Metalogic** is closely related to the philosophy of logic as the discipline investigating the *properties of formal logical systems*, like *consistency* and *completeness*.

Various characterizations of *the nature of logic* are found in the academic literature.

Logic is often seen as the study of *the laws of thought*, *valid inference* (correct reasoning), or *logical truth*.

Logic is a formal science that investigates how conclusions follow from premises in a topic-neutral manner, i.e. independent of the specific subject matter discussed.

One form of inquiry into the nature of logic focuses on the commonalities between various *logical formal systems* and on how they differ from *non-logical formal systems*. Important considerations in this respect are whether the formal system in question is compatible with *fundamental logical intuitions* and whether it is *complete*.

Different *conceptions of logic* can be distinguished according to whether they define logic as the study of *valid inference* or *logical truth*. Also, whether the criteria of valid inference and logical truth are specified in terms of *syntax* or *semantics*.

Different *types of logic* are often distinguished. *Formal logic* is only interested in the form of arguments, expressed in a formal language, and focuses on deductive inferences. The *validity of arguments* may depend on other factors than their form, like their content or their context. *Informal logic*, on the other hand, addresses a much wider range of arguments found also in natural language, which include non-deductive arguments.

Various logical formal systems or logics have been developed in the 20th century and it is the task of the philosophy of logic to classify them, to show how they are related to each other, and to address the problem of how there can be a manifold of logics in contrast to *one universally true logic*.

These logics can be divided into *classical logic*, usually identified with first-order logic, extended logics, and deviant logics.

*Extended logics* accept the basic formalism and the axioms of classical logic but extend them with new logical vocabulary. *Deviant logics*, on the other hand, reject certain core assumptions of classical logic and are therefore incompatible with it.

The philosophy of logic also investigates the nature and philosophical implications of the *fundamental concepts of logic*. 

This includes *the problem of truth*, especially of *logical truth*, which may be defined as truth depending only on the meanings of the *logical terms* used.

Another question concerns *the nature of premises and conclusions*, i.e. whether to understand them as thoughts, propositions, or sentences, and how they are composed of simpler constituents.

Together, premises and a conclusion constitute an *inference*, which can be either deductive or ampliative, depending on whether it is *necessarily truth-preserving* or introduces new and *possibly false* information.

The central concern in logic is the validity of deductive inferences. *Validity* is often defined in terms of *necessity*, i.e. an inference is valid iff it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.

*Incorrect inferences and arguments*, on the other hand, fail to support their conclusion. They can be categorized as formal or informal *fallacies* depending on whether they belong to formal or informal logic.

Logic has mostly been concerned with *definitory rules*, i.e. with the question of which *rules of inference* determine whether an argument is valid or not.

A separate topic of inquiry concerns the *strategic rules* of logic: the rules governing how to reach an intended conclusion given a certain set of premises, i.e. which inferences need to be drawn to arrive there.

The **metaphysics of logic** is concerned with the metaphysical status of the laws and objects of logic. An important dispute in this field is between *realists*, who hold that logic is based on facts that have mind-independent existence, and *anti-realists* like *conventionalists*, who hold that the laws of logic are based on the conventions governing the use of language.

Logic is closely related to various disciplines like mathematics, computer science, psychology, philosophy. A central issue in regard to ontology concerns the *ontological commitments* associated with the use of logic, for example, with *singular terms* and *existential quantifiers*. An important question in mathematics is regarding *logicism*, i.e. whether all mathematical truths can be grounded in the axioms of logic.
