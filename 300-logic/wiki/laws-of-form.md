# Laws of Form

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Form


"Laws of Form" (LoF) is a book by G. Spencer-Brown, published in 1969, that straddles the boundary between mathematics and philosophy.

LoF describes 3 distinct logical systems:
- *Primary arithmetic* (Ch4) whose models include Boolean arithmetic
- *Primary algebra* (Ch6) whose models include the two-element Boolean algebra (abbr as 2), Boolean logic, and the classical propositional calculus
- *Equations of the second degree* (Ch11), whose interpretations include finite automata and Alonzo Church's *Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA)*.

"Boundary algebra" is Meguire's (2011) term for the union of the primary algebra and the primary arithmetic. Laws of Form sometimes loosely refers to the "primary algebra" as well as to LoF.

## The book

The preface states that the work was first explored in 1959, and Spencer Brown cites Bertrand Russell as being supportive of his endeavour.

LoF emerged from work in electronic engineering its author did around 1960, and from subsequent lectures on mathematical logic he gave under the auspices of the University of London's extension program.

LoF has appeared in several editions. The second series of editions appeared in 1972 with the "Preface to the First American Edition" which emphasised the use of self-referential paradoxes (the most recent edition is a 1997 German translation) and has never gone out of print.

LoF's mystical and declamatory prose and its love of paradox make it a challenging read. Spencer-Brown was influenced by Wittgenstein and R. D. Laing. LoF also echoes a number of themes from the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred North Whitehead.

The entire book is written in an operational way, giving instructions to the reader instead of telling them what "is". In accordance with G. Spencer-Brown's interest in paradoxes, the only sentence that makes a statement that something is, is the statement which says no such statements are used in this book. Except for this one sentence the book can be seen as an example of E-Prime¬π.

  ¬π E-Prime (short for English Prime) denotes a restricted form of English in which authors avoid all forms of the verb "to be".

## Book reception

Ostensibly a work of formal mathematics and philosophy, LoF became something of a cult classic.

Those who agree point to LoF as embodying an enigmatic "mathematics of consciousness", its algebraic symbolism capturing an (perhaps even "the") implicit root of cognition: the ability to "distinguish".

LoF argues that primary algebra reveals striking connections among logic, Boolean algebra, and arithmetic, and the philosophy of language and mind.

Banaschewski (1977) argues that the primary algebra is nothing but new notation for Boolean algebra. Indeed, the two-element Boolean algebra `ùüê` can be seen as the intended interpretation of the primary algebra. Yet the notation of the primary algebra:
- fully exploits the duality characterizing not just Boolean algebras but all lattices
- highlights how syntactically distinct statements in logic and ùüê can have identical semantics
- dramatically simplifies Boolean algebra calculations, and proofs in sentential and syllogistic logic

Moreover, the syntax of the primary algebra can be extended to formal systems other than ùüê and sentential logic, resulting in *boundary mathematics*.

LoF has influenced, among others, Heinz von Foerster, Louis Kauffman, Niklas Luhmann, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela and William Bricken. Some of these authors have modified the primary algebra in a variety of interesting ways.

LoF claimed that certain well-known mathematical conjectures of very long standing, such as the four color theorem, Fermat's Last Theorem, and the Goldbach conjecture, are provable using extensions of the primary algebra. Spencer-Brown eventually circulated a purported proof of the four color theorem, but it met with skepticism

A short, easy-to-understand, animated, educational, detailed, close reading of George Spencer-Brown's book, 'Laws of Form'. The course follows the structure of the book, going through it chapter by chapter, theorem by theorem, consequence by consequence, looking at definitions in detail, talking through the proofs step by step, expanding and explaining the shorthand references Spencer-Brown presents in the elegant but minimalistic main body of his work. 

`Laws of form and finite automata`, Peter Turney, 2007
G. Spencer Brown's book Laws of Form informally presents three distinct logical systems. The third system is interpreted here through Alonzo Church's restricted recursive arithmetic. Restricted recursive arithmetic was introduced by Church in 1955 as the first formal system capturing finite automata. It is suggested that this interpretation is closer to Spencer Brown's original ideas than the interpretation with three-valued logic given by Francisco Varela.
