# Proposition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition

A **proposition** is often characterized as the primary bearer of truth or falsity.

A proposition is a central concept in logic, semantics, philosophy of language and related fields.

Propositions are also often characterized as being the kind of thing that *declarative sentences* denote. For example, the sentence "The sky is blue" denotes a proposition that the sky is blue.

However, crucially, propositions are not themselves *linguistic expressions*. For example, the English sentence "Snow is white" denotes the same proposition as the German sentence "Schnee ist wei√ü" even though the two sentences are not the same.

Similarly, propositions can also be characterized as the *objects of belief* and other propositional attitudes. For example, if one believes that the sky is blue, what one believes is the proposition that the sky is blue.

A proposition can also be thought of as a kind of idea: proposition is a statement with a *truth value*, which people can discuss whether it is true or not.

Formally, *propositions are often modeled as functions which map a possible world to a truth value*. For example, the proposition that the sky is blue can be modeled as a function which would return the truth value 'true' if given the actual world as input, but would return 'false' given some alternate world where the sky is not blue.

However, a number of alternative formalizations have been proposed, notably the *structured propositions view*.

Propositions have played a large role throughout the history of logic, linguistics, philosophy of language, and related disciplines.

Some researchers have doubted whether a consistent definition of *propositionhood* is possible, David Lewis even remarking that "the conception we associate with the word 'proposition' may be something of a jumble of conflicting desiderata". The term is often used broadly and has been used to refer to various related concepts.
