# Truth

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth

Part of a series on [Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)

>*Truth* is the property of being in accord with fact or reality.

In everyday language, *truth* is typically ascribed to sentences which are claims that may or may not correspond to reality. Such sentences (declarative sentences, statements) are called *propositions*, the most characteristic property of which is that they can be assigned a truth value. If a proposition does indeed correspond to reality, it is said that it is true (it is assigned the truth value of 'true'). If a proposition does not correspond to reality, it is said that it is false (it is assigned the truth value of 'false').

In classical logic and thought, truth is usually held to be the opposite of *falsehood* (controversal, as this view excludes middle/other options).

The concept of truth is discussed and debated in various contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend on truth, where truth is an assumed property, rather than a property under discussion; these include science, law, journalism, even everyday life.

Some philosophers consider the concept of *truth as a primitive concept* and thus hold that it cannot be explained in terms of its constituent parts because there are none.

The **correspondence theory of truth** views truth as a correspondence of language or thought to the actuality of a mind-independent world.

Various *theories of truth* and *views of truth* continue to be debated among philosophers. Some of the related questions include:
- Whether it is even possible to give an informative definition of truth
- Identifying things are truth-bearers and are therefore capable of being true or false.
- If truth and falsehood are bivalent, or if other truth values exist.
- Identifying the criteria of truth that allow us to identify it and to distinguish it from falsehood.
- The role of truth in constituting knowledge.
- If truth is always absolute, or if it can be relative to one's perspective.

## Etymology

The word "truth" involves both the quality of "faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity", and that of "agreement with fact or reality", in Anglo-Saxon expressed by `sōþ` (Modern English 'sooth').

Besides English, all Germanic languages have a distinction between "truth as fidelity" and "truth as factuality". To express "factuality", North Germanic opted for nouns derived from `sanna` ("to assert, affirm"), while continental West Germanic (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of `wâra` ("faith, trust, pact"), which is cognate to Slavic `vera` "(religious) faith", but influenced by Latin `verus`.

Romance languages use terms following the Latin `veritas`, while Greek `aletheia`, Slavic `istina`, Russian `pravda`, Sanskrit `sat` (related to 'sooth' and 'sanna') have separate etymological origins.

## Major theories

  - correspondence
  - coherence
  - pragmatic
  - constructivist
  - consensus
- minimalist
  - deflationary
  - performative
  - redundancy and related
  - philosophical skepticism
- pluralist

The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may be considered true (whether by a single person or an entire society) is dealt with by the 5 most prevalent *substantive theories of truth* listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.

According to a survey of philosophers from 2009, respondents lean towards
- 45% correspondence theories
- 21% deflationary theories
- 14% epistemic theories
