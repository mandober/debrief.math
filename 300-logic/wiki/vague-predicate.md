# Vague predicate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagueness

Vagueness is a property of predicates in linguistics, philosophy and logic. A *vague predicate* is one which gives rise to borderline cases.

For example, the English adjective "tall" is vague since it is not clearly true or false for someone of middling height. By contrast, the word "prime" is not vague since every number is definitively either prime or not.

Vagueness is commonly diagnosed by a predicate's ability to give rise to the *Sorites paradox*.

Vagueness is separate from *ambiguity*, in which an expression has multiple denotations. For instance the word "bank" is ambiguous since it can refer either to a river bank or to a financial institution, but there are no borderline cases between both interpretations.

Vagueness is a major topic of research in philosophical logic, where it serves as a potential challenge to classical logic. Work in formal semantics has sought to provide a compositional semantics for vague expressions in natural language. Work in philosophy of language has addressed implications of vagueness for the theory of meaning, while metaphysicians have considered whether reality itself is vague.
