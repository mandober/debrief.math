# Truth predicate

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_predicate

In formal *theories of truth*, a **truth predicate** is a fundamental concept based on the sentences of a formal language as interpreted logically. That is, it formalizes the concept that is normally expressed by saying that a sentence, statement or idea "is true."

## Languages which allow a truth predicate

Based on "Chomsky Definition", a language is assumed to be a countable set of sentences, each of finite length, and constructed out of a countable set of symbols. A theory of syntax is assumed to introduce symbols, and rules to construct well-formed sentences. A language is called *fully interpreted* if meanings are attached to its sentences so that they all are either true or false.

A fully interpreted language `L` which does not have a truth predicate can be extended to a fully interpreted language `L′` that contains a truth predicate `T`, i.e. the sentence `A ⇔ T⌈A⌉` is true for every sentence `A` of `L′`, where `T⌈A⌉` stands for "the sentence (denoted by) `A` is true".

The main tools to prove this result are ordinary and transfinite induction, recursion methods, and ZF set theory.
