# The principle of bivalence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence

In logic, the semantic principle (or law) of bivalence states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition (of a theory under inspection) has exactly one truth value, either true or false. A logic satisfying this principle is called a *two-valued logic* or *bivalent logic*.

>The principle of bivalence states that every proposition has exactly one of the two truth value - it is either true or false.

In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a semantics may or may not possess. However, it is not the same as *the law of excluded middle*, and a semantics may satisfy LEM without being bivalent.

The principle of bivalence is studied in philosophical logic to address the question of which natural language statements have a well-defined truth value.

Sentences that predict events in the future, and sentences that seem open to interpretation, are particularly difficult for philosophers who hold that the principle of bivalence applies to all declarative natural-language statements.

*Many-valued logics* formalize ideas that a realistic characterization of the *notion of consequence* requires the admissibility of premises that, owing to vagueness, temporal or quantum indeterminacy, or reference-failure, cannot be considered classically bivalent. Reference failures can also be addressed by free logics.

## Relation of bivalence and LEM

The principle of bivalence (POB) is related to the law of excluded middle (LEM), though LEM is a syntactic expression of the language of a logic 
of the form `P ∨ ¬P`.

The difference between the POB and LEM is important because there are logics that admit POB but not LEM.

For example, the three-valued *Logic of Paradox* (LP) validates LEM, but not the law of non-contradiction (LNC), `¬(P ∧ ¬P)`, and its intended semantics is not bivalent.

Intuitionistic logic is a two-valued logic that doesn't admit LEM. 
In classical two-valued logic both LEM and LNC hold.
