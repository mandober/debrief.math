# Factors of classification of logic systems

The constant development and interest in logic has brought enormous proliferation, not only of different systems of logic, but of the factors that contribute to further division and branching of logic systems. Today, it is virtually impossible to come up with a wholesome system that can categorize all the different types of logic.

Note that here the term "categorization" is used synonymously with the term "classification", thus a category is synonymous with a class (unless explicitly specified). Moreover, the different words that represent groupings, like category, class, sort, type, kind, and similar, do not inherently signify any inclusion order (unless explicitly specified).

## The big three

The first division of all system of logics should probably sort out the big-3 systems each in its own category:
- syllogistic
- propositional
- predicate

But what should be the factor (criteria) of this classification? Lacking a better candidate, it is named "by broadest scope", "broadest division". Besides, there is no universal classification so coming up with very specific names for the criteria of division may be confusing. To come up with any name for such a creteria, we should examine the factors that make the logic systems "at the same level" different from meach other. But placing different logic systems on the same level is determined precisly by the criteria we are trying to discover. It seems the whole endeavor is futile, so it shouldn't be taken as some kind of "official" classification. It's just a means to grapple the enourmous complexity and number of logic systems.

The main object of syllogistic logic are sentences, called propositions, but this is true for propositional logic as well. Anyway, whatever the name for this creteria we come up with, it wont't uniquely identify any of these 3 main kinds of logic. Therefore, just note that *the names given to these categories, classes, criteria and factors are arbitrary*. In fact, the entire hierarchy of system of logic is entirely ad hoc and arbitrary.
