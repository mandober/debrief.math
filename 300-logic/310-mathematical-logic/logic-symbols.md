# Interpretation of symbols in logic and math


## Reading logic formulas

p → q
- if p then q
- given p, q
- p implies q
- q only if p
- q is the necessary condition for p
- p is a sufficient condition for q

if {it works} then {it'll revolve}
- given that it works, it's revolving
- it revolves only if it works *hmm*


p → ¬¬p
- if p, then it is NOT the case that NOT p

p ⇔ q
- p if and only if q
- if p then q and if q then p




(p = T) → (¬p = F) ∧ (¬¬p = T)    
if p is TRUE, then NOT p is FALSE and NOT NOT p is TRUE

p = ¬¬p
- if p is TRUE, then NOT NOT p is TRUE
- if p is FALSE, then NOT NOT p is FALSE


p = ¬¬p
¬¬q = q
p ∧ q



p → q
- if p then q
  - if {it rains} then {the streets are wet}
- given p, then q
  - given {that n ∈ ℕ and even} then {n >= 0 and n ×÷⁒±‗ 2 = 0}
- p implies q
- q only if p
