An **implicative normal form** is the conjunction of a set of implications, each of which has a conjunction of terms on the left and a disjunction of terms on the right, `⋀[⋀(a✻) -> ⋁(s✻)]✻`, like a conjunction of sequents, `⋀(a|-s)*`. A nice property of classical FOL is that a formula can be reduced to INF through a series of syntactic simplifications.
