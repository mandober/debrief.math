# Axiomatic system

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system

In mathematics and logic, an **axiomatic system** is any set of axioms from which some or all axioms can be used in conjunction to logically derive theorems.

A *theory* is a consistent, relatively-self-contained body of knowledge which usually contains an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems.

An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of formal system. A *formal theory* is an axiomatic system (usually formulated within model theory) that describes a set of sentences that is closed under logical implication. A [formal proof][fop] is a complete rendition of a mathematical proof within a formal system.
