# Logic :: Logics :: List :: By factors

Classification of logics according to various criteria. Begin with the orthogonal factors, before bogging down into minutia.

- cognition

# Logic :: Index :: Logic Systems :: By factors

Factors
- certainty of the conclusion
  - truth of premises
  - validity of argument
- number of truth values
- monotonicity of entailment
- commutativity of connectives
- type of atoms
- order
- structural aspects
- admitted laws
- properties of logical connectives
- theory of truth
- existence assumptions
  - classical logic constrains constants to be in DOD
    - constants must name existing things (that are in DOD)
    - 'santa' and 'Sherlock' both refer to ∅
  - free logic does not have this constraint
    - it is free of existence assumptions
    - `Exists` is an important predicate:
      - `Exists(Italy)` is true
      - `Exists(unicorn)` is false



* certainty of the conclusion
  - deductive
