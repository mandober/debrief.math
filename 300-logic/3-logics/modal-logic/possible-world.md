# Possible world

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world

>A *possible world* is a complete and consistent way the world is or could have been.

Possible worlds are widely used as a formal device in logic, philosophy, and linguistics in order to provide a semantics for intensional and modal logic.

We can conceive of possible worlds in various ways, depending on what we're interested in modelling. Possible worlds might be hypothetical alternate worlds: there is the actual world - the way things really are - and an infinity of other worlds that differ in subtle (different in just the things we're modelling) or dramatic ways (e.g. different laws of physics, dinosaurs have survived) from the actual world. All these worlds are connected, with the worlds that are slightly different being closer to the actual one, and those that are dramatically different being far away. In CS, possible worlds may be the various states of a program that evolves over time.

The concept of truth in regards to possible worlds, yields the *necessary truth* - truth that holds in all the possible worlds, and *possible truth* - truth that holds in some possible worlds.

Unary connectives, `□` and `◊` are used to model necessity and possibility. `□p` means that a proposition `p` is necessarily true. 
`◊p` means that a proposition `p` is possibly true. 

*Deductive truths* are the necessary truths; e.g. `2 + 2 = 4` is true in all possible worlds. *Contigent truths* are the possible truths (induction, abduction, conduction).

The metaphysical status of possible worlds has been a subject of controversy in philosophy, with *modal realists*, such as David Lewis, arguing that they are literally existing alternate realities, while others, such as Robert Stalnaker, arguing that the opposite.
