## Categorical propositions

> A **categorical proposition** is a kind of proposition which asserts/denies that all/some of the members of one class of things (the subject term) are included in another class of things (the predicate term).

Propositions are abstract logical entities 

is concretely realized as a declarative sentence, and thus it has (or can be assigned) a truth value - an argument does not have a truth value




- The subject term is commonly abbreviated as `S`.
- The predicate term is commonly abbreviated as `P`.
- The copula is commonly represented by the verb "to be" (i.e. is, are).









>A syllogism is a deductive argument that consists of categorical propositions.

NOTE: Propositions are different entities than arguments, even though both are abstract logical entities. A proposition is concretely realized as a declarative sentence, and thus it has (or can be assigned) a truth value - an argument does not have a truth value! What (deductive) arguments have are the properties of validity (correctness) and soundness - which, in turn, are not the properties of propositions! In syllogistic logic, strictly speaking, a syllogism is an argument that is made of categorical propositions. Loosely, however, the term "syllogism" is often used for both propositions and arguments.

Unlike propositions in general, categorical propositions only have 4 strict forms used to affirm or negate that all or some members of a class are predicated on another class. That members of a class A are predicated on a class B most commonly means that they belong to it (A is B), have it (A has B), or some other verb that is in the context of syllogism called *copula* - it joins the subject term with a predicate term.

In linguistics, the primary elements of a *simple sentence* are *subject*, *predicate*, and *object* (e.g. "A subject predicated on an object"). However, since an object is not always present, the simplest form of a simple sentence is a *subject-predicate sentence*, in which the subject is commonly a noun phrase and the predicate a verb phrase (e.g. "All men are mortal", where the noun phrase "All man" is the subject, and the verb phrase "are mortal" is the predicate).

Unlike in linguistics, in syllogistic logic subjects and predicates are *terms* that belong to certain classes of entities. In the proposition "All men are mortal", the subject term is "Men" and the predicate term is "mortal", and they are joined with the copula "are" (to be). So, the subject term belongs to the class of all men (and here it is that entire class; but it could have also been a part of the class, like "Socrates", "Greeks", etc.). The predicate is usually a class in its entirety (here it is the class of mortal creatures, but it could have also been some other class like "bearded", "old", "Greeks", etc.).

So, in a categorical proposition, the **subject term** tends to name the entire class or its part, while the **predicate term** tends to name the entire class. The **cupola** can be considered to always signify "is/are" relation between the two terms.

The **quantifiers** are the two words that signify the number of entitiers from a class: `all`, called the *universal quantifier*, specifies the entire class (all entities from a class), while `some`, called the *particular quantifier*, specifyies *at least one* entity. When we have a single concrete name, like Socrates, we understand it as a term that is implicitly (particularly) quantified.

A **domain** is another name for a class or category. So, a categorical proposition asserts/denies that all/some of the members of one domain (domain of the subject term) are included in another category or class (domain the predicate term).

The last aspect of a categorical proposition is that of **polarity**: a proposition can be *affirmative* or *negative*. Polarity is expressed is different ways due to the courtesy of the English language (inspiring the need for symbolic representation). Namely, universal affirmative is expressed by "all" (All S are P), but universal negative uses "no" (No S are P) (thus merging the quantifier "all" with negation "not" into a single word "no", instead of using e.g. "not all"). Particular quantificatin is expressed by "some", but affirmative's cupola is unprefixed (Some S are P), while the cupola of particular negative has the "not" prefix (Some S are not P).

A syllogism is a type of deductive argument that consists of 3 propositions:
- 2 premises
- 1 conclusion

Aristotle has identified 4 distinct types of categorical propositions, called the standard forms and symbolically named `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`.

**4 standard forms** of categorical propositions:
- (A) All S are P.
- (E) No S are P.
- (I) Some S are P.
- (O) Some S are not P.
