# Syllogism


Arguments of this form are called *syllogistic arguments* or a syllogisms. They are deductive arguments studied in the *syllogistic logic* or *Aristotelian logic*. A *syllogism* or a *triple* consists of two premises, *major premise* followed by a *minor premise*, and a single *conclusion*.


*Categorical proposition* is a proposition that asserts or denies a relationship between two classes of existing things.

Categorical propositions are composed of 3 components, and the two most important of are called *terms* - a subject and a predicate. Aristotelian or term logic has the subject term and the predicate term.

Components of categorical propositions
- *Subject term* is a class of things
- *Predicate term* is what is said about the subject.
- *Copula* is a verb that connects subject and predicate
- *Quantifiers* specify quantity
  - universal: ALL; affirmative or negative
  - particular: SOME; affirmative or negative

4 categorical propositions:
- universal affirmative,  __A__,  `All S are P`     distributed: S
- universal negative,     __E__,   `No S are P`     distributed: S, P
- particular affirmative, __I__, `Some S are P`     distributed: (none)
- particular negative,    __O__, `Some S are NOT P` distributed: P

A term in a categorical proposition is *distributed* when it indicates all members of a class.

-  ∀x Px = ¬∃x¬Px         All S are     P == No   S is  not P
-  ∀x¬Px = ¬∃x Px         All S are not P == No   S is      P
- ¬∀x¬Px =  ∃x Px     Not all S are not P == Some S are     P
- ¬∀x Px =  ∃x¬Px     Not all S are     P == Some S are not P
