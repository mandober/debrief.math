# Middle term

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_term

In syllogistic logic, a *middle term* is a term that appears (as a subject or predicate of a categorical proposition) in both premises but not in the conclusion of a categorical syllogism.

Example (the middle term is emphasized):
- (major premise) All *men* are mortal.
- (minor premise) Socrates is a *man*.
- (conclusion) Socrates is mortal.
