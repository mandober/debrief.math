# Logic :: Syllogistic logic :: Introduction

It is unclear who was the first to initiate the study of logic, but the preserved records indicate that logic was recognized as science and studied by the Ancient Greeks, with Aristotle today considered as the father of logic.

Aristotle had recognize and descibed the types of deductive and inductive reasoning, putting more faith in the former and holding inductive arguments as inferior, only good until the corresponding deductive argument is discovered.

The study of syllogistic arguments, that was initiated and comprehensively described by Aristotle, is an important branch of deductive logic, and it is variously called
- *syllogistic logic* because it studies categorical propositions or syllogisms
- *Aritotle's logic* is the original logic of Aristotle which has some differences compared to its later iterations.
- *Aristototelian logic* includes the original Aristotle's logic as well as its extensions developed during the mediaval ages.
- *mediaval logic* is the name that emphasizes these extensions.
- *term logic* is a modern name for this system based on it distinguishing subjects and predicates and making them the atomic terms.
- *traditional logic* is yet another synonym (yas)

Practically, these names are used interchangibly and the only reason to prefer one name over the other is a particular apsect you want to underline. Note that this type of logic is sometimes also (incorrectly) referred to as *categorical logic* - a name which is primarily reserved for the study of logic in terms of category theory.
