# Syllogistic formulas

syllogisms | affirmative | negative
universal  |      A      |       E
particular |      I      |       O

- A: All A's are B's
- E: No A's are B's
- I: Some A's are B's
- O: Some A's are not B's

Relations
- 2 contradictions:  A ⤄ O ↘, I ⤄ E ↗
- 1 contrary:        A ⇔ E, cannot both be true, can both be false
- 1 subcontraries:   I ⇔ O, cannot both be true, at least one true
- 2 subalternations: A - I, E - O truth flows downward ↓, falsity upward ↑

**Existential import**: universals may be vacuuously true, but not particulars. That is, universal propositions have existential import, existential do not.

Unlike syllogistic (Aristotelian) square of opposition, *Boolean square of opposition* only has the two contradiction relations, between A-O and I-E, because there is no existential import.


Barbara, C ⊂ A ⊂ B
- All A are B     (A) All men are mortal.
- All C are A     (A) All Greeks are men.
- All C are B     (A) Therefore, all Greeks are mortal.

Darii, C ⊂ A ⊂ B
- All  A is B     (A) All men are mortal.
- Some C is A     (I) Socrates is a man.
- Some C is B     (I) Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
