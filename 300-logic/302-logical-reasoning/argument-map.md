# Argument map

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map

An argument map or argument diagram is a visual representation of the structure of an argument.

An argument map is a type of information mapping.

An argument map typically includes the key components of the argument, traditionally called the conclusion and the premises, also called contention and reasons. Argument maps can also show co-premises, objections, counterarguments, rebuttals, and lemmas.

There are different styles of argument map but they are often functionally equivalent and represent an argument's individual claims and the relationships between them.

Argument maps are commonly used in the context of teaching and applying critical thinking. The purpose of mapping is to uncover the logical structure of arguments, identify unstated assumptions, evaluate the support an argument offers for a conclusion, and aid understanding of debates.

An argument map is not to be confused with a concept map or a mind map, two other kinds of node-link diagram which have different constraints on nodes and links.
