# Formal system

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system

A formal system is an *abstract structure* 
used for inferring theorems from axioms 
according to a set of rules.

These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the *logical calculus* of the formal system. A formal system is essentially an "axiomatic system".

In 1921, David Hilbert proposed to use such a system as the foundation for the knowledge in mathematics.

A formal system may represent a well-defined system of abstract thought.

The term *formalism* is sometimes a rough synonym for formal system, but it also refers to a given style of *notation* (e.g. Finch-style notation).

## Background

Each formal system is described by *primitive symbols* (which collectively form an *alphabet*) to finitely construct a *formal language* from a *set of axioms* through *inferential rules of formation*.

The system thus consists of *valid formulas* built up through finite combinations of the primitive symbols - combinations that are formed from the axioms in accordance with the stated rules of inference.

More formally, this can be expressed as the following:
- A finite set of symbols, called *alphabet*, 
  concatenated into finite strings called *formulas*.
- A *grammar* prescribing the rules of legal formula formation. 
  A *well-formed formula* is build according to the rules of the grammar. 
  It is often required that there be a *decision procedure* for deciding whether a given formula is actually a wff.
- A set of axioms, or axiom schemata, consisting of wffs.
- A set of inference rules. 
  A wff inferrable from the axioms is a *theorem of the formal system*.


**Recursive formal system**: a formal system is said to be recursive (effective or recursively enumerable), if the set of axioms is a decidable set, and the set of inference rules is a semidecidable set.

Inference and entailment

The **entailment** of the system by its logical foundation is what distinguishes a formal system from others which may have some basis in an abstract model. 

Often the formal system will be the basis for, or even identified with, a larger theory or field (e.g. Euclidean geometry) consistent with the usage in modern mathematics such as model theory.
