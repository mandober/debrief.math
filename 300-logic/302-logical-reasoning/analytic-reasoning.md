# Analytic reasoning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_reasoning

**Analytical reasoning**, or analytical thinking, refers to the ability to look at information, be it qualitative or quantitative in nature, and discern patterns within the information.

Analytical reasoning involves *deductive reasoning* with no specialised knowledge, such as:
- comprehending the basic structure of a set of relationships
- recognizing logically equivalent statements
- inferring what could be true or must be true from given facts and rules

Analytical reasoning is *axiomatic* in that its truth is self-evident. In contrast, *synthetic reasoning* requires that we include empirical observations.

The specific terms "analytic" and "synthetic" themselves were introduced by Kant in 1781 at the beginning of his "Critique of Pure Reason".
