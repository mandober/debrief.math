# Universal quantification

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification

The symbol `∀` is used to express universal claims, those we express in English using quantified phrases like everything, each thing, all things, anything. It is always used in connection with a variable, `∀x`; it is a variable binding operator.

"Everything is at home" is `∀x.Home(x)` in FOL, which says that every object `x` meets the following condition: `x` is at home. Or more naturally, it says that everything whatsoever is at home.

Such unconditional claims are rare; more common are *restricted universal claims*, such as "Every doctor is smart", translated as `∀x(D(x) -> S(x))`. It claims that given any object at all (call it `x`), if `x` is a doctor, then `x` is smart. In other words, if you pick anything at all from DOD, you'll find either that it is not a doctor, or that it is smart, or both.

Universal quantification is a generalization of logical conjunction applied to all elements in a DOD.
