This section (About) should mentioned the subject matter (here Logic), briefly outlining
- what it is about
- definition of the subject matter
- overview of the subject matter
  - objective overview: all that exists out there
  - (subjective) overview: what is presented here (in these notes)
- points of interest, index of
- subject matter classification
  - forking factors
    - opposing factors (opposing pairs)
    - orthogonal factors
    - misc other factors
  - actual hierarchy
    - actual classes
    - hierarchy of classes and subclasses
- entities involved, "the players", the description of
- properties
- attributes, principles, laws, identities
- actual (class') representatives, exploration of
  - actual (individual) concrete members/entities

- logics, tier 1 division
  - syllogistic logic, subsumed by propositional and predicate logic
  - propositional logic
  - predicate logic
- logics, tier 2 division
  - classical
  - non-classical
    - intuitionistic
  - quick mention of division factors spawning other kinds of logic
    - substructural, modalities, paraconsistency, multi-valued
- natural language
  - Only declarative sentences of a natural language have a truth value. 
  - too large and too complex, but most of all too ambiguous
- declarative sentences
  - sentences with a truth value
  - (propositional) sentences or statements; propositions
- truth value
  - bivalence
  - classical logic
  - default: classical logic = bivalence + LEM (at least)
    - bivalence: only two truth values
    - classical logic: *proposition is either true or false, not both nor neither*
    - The Law of Exluded Middle (LEM)
      - tertium non datur
      - the principle that there is no middle (third) option: a proposition is not only true or false, but it is only ever true or false - it is never neither true or false, and it is never true and false at the same time.
      - LEM also means that (0 is false, 1 is true, as is common):
        - ¬1 = 0, ¬0 = 1
        - ¬¬1 = 1, ¬¬0 = 0
      - Even though the LEM principle seems sensible enough, the question is - as always in mathematics - is it general? Can we really say that all proposition "behave" thus. Do they really have


       it states something that is almost always the case

      enough case 
      it is usually the case       is common enough
      - A famous counterexample is the declarative sentence "I am a liar".

- `EX` Extinct                - extict as dodo
- `EW` Extinct in the wild    - known only to survive on cable TV
- `CR` Critically Endangered  - extremely high risk of extinction in the wild
- `EN` Endangered             - higher risk of extinction in the wild
- `VN` Vulnerable             - high risk of extinction in the wild
- `NT` Near Threatened        - likely to become endangered in the near future
- `CD` Conservation Dependent - conserved to prevent being near threatened
- `LC` Least concern          - not threatened
- `DD` Data deficient         - not enough data
- `NE` Not evaluated          - unevaluated
