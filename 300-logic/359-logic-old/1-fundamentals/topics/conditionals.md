Difference between
- indicative conditionals
- subjunctive and counterfactual

The *restrictor analysis* of Lewis, Kratzer and Heim is a theory of how conditional meaning come about compositionally: 'if' has no meaning other than serving to mark the restriction to an operator elsewhere in the conditional construction.

Interactions of conditionals
- with modality
- with tense and aspect

*Conditionals* are sentences that talk about a possible scenario that may or may not be actual and describe what (else) is the case in that scenario. Or, alternatively, conditionals state in what kind of possible scenarios a given proposition is true.

The *canonical form of a conditional* is a two-part sentence consisting of an antecedent (premise, hypothesis, protasis) marked with 'if' and a consequent (conclusion, subsequent, succedent, apodosis), sometimes marked with 'then'.

Conditional meanings can be conveyed with other means as well, each of which merits its own study:
- (2) Had he admitted his guilt, he would have gotten off easier.
- (3) Take another step and I'll knock you down.
- (4) He was pushed or he wouldn't have fallen down the cliff.
- (5) Without you, I would be lost.
- (6) I would have beaten Kasparov

## Types of conditionals

There are four types of conditionals:
- speech act conditionals (relevance conditionals, biscuit conditionals)
- factual conditionals (premise conditionals)
- indicative conditionals
- subjunctive/counterfactual conditionals


*Speech act conditionals* (relevance conditionals, biscuit conditionals) do not state in any sense conditions under which the consequent is true, rather they seem to somehow operate on a higher speech act level.
- (8) There are biscuits on the sideboard if you want them.
- (9) I paid you back yesterday, if you remember.

*Factual conditionals* (premise conditionals) often echo someone else's introduction of the antecedent:
- (10) If you're so clever, why don't you do this problem on your own?
- (11) If it is indeed that late, we should leave.

The two main kinds of conditionals that semantic research has been concerned with are indicative and subjunctive/counterfactual conditionals.

*Indicative conditionals*
- (12.a) If Bonzo played his drums, Page played his guitar.

*Subjunctive/counterfactual conditionals*
- (12.b) If Bonzo had played his drums, Page would have played his guitar.

The terminology is linguistically inept (the morphological marking is one of tense and aspect, not of indicative vs subjunctive mood), but it is deeply entrenched.

Superficially, the striking difference between the two kinds of conditionals is that indicative conditionals somehow convey that the truth of the antecedent is an open issue, while subjunctive conditionals seem to convey that the antecedent is false. (It is also possible for conditionals to convey that the antecedent is true if one considers locutions like 'since' or 'given that' to be conditional connectives). Upon closer investigation, it is not possible to maintain that subjunctive conditionals are invariably counterfactual, e.g.
- (13) If Jones had taken arsenic, he would have shown just exactly those symptoms which he does in fact show.

A doctor who utters (13) might be prepared to use it as part of an argument that the antecedent is in fact true, so the subjunctive conditional could not be conveying counterfactuality as part of its meaning.

There are some subjunctive conditionals that arguably are automatically counterfactual, like the *"mismatched past counterfactuals"* and the *verb-first counterfactuals*:
- (14) If Charlie had married Sally tomorrow, he would have had his bachelor party tonight. #So, let's see whether the party is tonight.
- (15) Had Charlie married Sally yesterday, they would have left on their honeymoon by now. #So, let's see whether they're gone.

Even abstracting away from the issue of counterfactuality, there are strong reasons to conclude that the two kinds of conditionals are quite different in their meaning. This is best shown by minimal pairs:
- (16.a) If Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, someone else did.
- (16.b) If Oswald hadn't killed Kenney, someone else would have.

While most people would accept (16a) as true, only some would accept (16b).

The meaning of the indicative conditional seems to correspond fairly accurately to the *Ramsey Test*:

  If two people are arguing "If P will Q?", and are both in doubt as to P, they are adding P hypothetically to their stock of knowledge and arguing on that basis about Q.

Knowing that Kennedy was assassinated and having maybe only the slightest doubt that the assassin may not have been Oswald, our stock of knowledge incremented hypothetically with "Oswald didn't kill Kennedy" would support "somebody else killed Kennedy", and thus we accept (16a) as true.

Informally, (16b) is evaluated quite differently: we project how things would have turned out if Oswald hadn't killed Kennedy. And many of us have only the haziest ideas of what would have happened, certainly no conviction that some assassination was inevitable; and thus, we reject (16b).

The questions for the semanticist are two-fold:
- (i) formal analysis of different meanings that conditionals convey
- (ii) the compositional derivation of these meanings

Before we turn to the main theories of conditional meaning, we should note that *semantic analyses of conditionals* is also responsible for explaining a host of facts concerning the combination of conditionals with other constructions. These include: the role of 'then' in the consequent, complex conditionals like 'only if', 'even if', 'unless', modals in the consequent, disjunctions in the antecedent, negative polarity in the antecedent, embedding of conditionals under quantifiers, conditional questions, conditional imperatives.
