TL/DR. Motives, ideas and situations expecting formalization of logic, and in general, mathematics. Expecting of formal symbolic logic languages. Precursors.

In the middle of the XIX century, issues concerning the foundations of mathematics began to arise motivated by problems of calculus and the invention of other non-Euclidean geometries, and proliferation of paradoxes, especially in set theory. Mathematics was seemingly falling apart due to the lack of rigor and firm foundation. Mathematicians had to worry about the formalization and axiomatization of arithmetics in particular, and the mathematics in general.

David Hilbert had it. Crashing the International Congress of Epistemology, held in Paris in 1900, he presented a list of 23 problems that mathematics must solve by the end if the century or else. Confused epistemologist booed him off the stage, which enraged Hilbert countered by laying down the second of his 23 problems, in excrutiating details. Hilbert challenged mathematicians to come up with a set of axioms that would show arithmetic consistent.


The situation made mathematicians pay attention to the foundations of mathematics, something that was avoided at all costs before and ever since this crisis. It was a dirty job but someone had to do it, so a cunning plan was devised: let logicians have at it. It worked marvelously! Logicians immediately started cranking, hoping to show them mathematicans that math is a mere derivation of logic. Soon, their labor paid of marvelously! spawnning a new term that succintly summed the whole affair - *logicism*! It meant that the entirety of mathematics could be derived from logics! Most hilariously, that logic comes before mathematics! That logic rulez! It made many a logicists extatic then institutionalized. Save for the new term, nothing was achieved. It turned out math is more complicated than anyone assumed.


In the first two decades of the XX century, 3 major schools of *mathematical philosophy* developed.

*Platonists* held that mathematical objects had an existence independent of human thought, and thus the job of mathematicians was to discover the truths about these mathematical objects.

*Intuitionists*, led by the Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer held that mathematics should be restricted to concrete operations performed on finite structures. Since vast areas of modern mathematics depended on using infinitary methods, Brouwer's position implied that most of the mathematics of the previous 3000 years should be discarded until the results could be reproved using finitistic arguments.

Hilbert was appalled at this suggestion and he became the leading exponent of the *Formalist* school, which held that mathematics was nothing more than the manipulation of meaningless symbols according to certain rules and that the consistency of such a system was nothing more than saying that the rules prohibited certain combinations of the symbols from occurring.

Hilbert developed a plan to refute the Intuitionist position that most of mathematics was suspect. He proposed to prove, using finite methods that the Intuitionists would accept, that all of classical mathematics was consistent. By using finite methods in his consistency proof, Hilbert was sure that his proof would be accepted by Brouwer and his followers, and then the mathematical community would be able to return to what Hilbert considered the more important work of advancing mathematical knowledge.

In the 1920s many mathematicians became actively involved in Hilbert's project, and there were several partial results that seemed to indicate that Hilbert's plan could be accomplished. Then came the shock. On Sunday, September 7th, 1930, at the Conference on Epistemology of the Exact Sciences held in Königsberg, Germany, a 24-year-old Austrian mathematician **Kurt Gödel** announced that he could show that there is a sentence such that the sentence is true but not provable in a formal system of classical mathematics. In 1931 Gödel published the proof of this claim along with the proof of his *Second Incompleteness Theorem*, which said that no consistent formal system of mathematics could prove its own consistency. Thus Hilbert's program was impossible, and there would be no finitistic proof that the axioms of arithmetic were consistent.

Mathematics, which had reigned for centuries as the embodiment of certainty, lost its way. It cannot prove that it is consistent. Although we believe that mathematics is consistent, we know we cannot prove it, unless we are wrong. For if we are wrong, mathematics is inconsistent. And (as we will see) if mathematics is inconsistent, then it can prove anything, including the statement which says that mathematics is consistent.

Mathematics is still useful and shit, but we must lower our expectation and rephrase the **Gaussian blurb** that mathematics is the queen of sciences.

Formal languages, mathematical structures, deductive systems, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, something something... stfu and suffer in silence like everyone else.
