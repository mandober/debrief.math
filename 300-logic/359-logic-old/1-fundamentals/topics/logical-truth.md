# Logical truth





- a priori vs a posteriori (epistemic)
- analytic vs synthetic (semantic)
- necessity vs contingency/possibility (metaphysical - about the nature of the world and reality; about modalities)
- syllogistic arguments
- validity and soundness



The usual opinion is that these are coextensive:
- necessary = analytic = *a priori*
- contingent = synthetic = *a posteriori*

But is it really so?

Can we have *synthetic a priori* propositions? That is, propositions that depend on the way the world is, but whose truth can be determined independenly of our experience of the world. Kant held that the propositions of arithmetic and geometry are such propositions.
