# Symbolic logic

(`A Survey of Symbolic Logic` - C. I. Lewis, 1918)

The subject we are concerned with is referred to as *symbolic logic*, logicism, logistic, algebra of logic, calculus of logic, mathematical logic, algorithmic logic. We are concerned with logic that uses symbols in a way as exhibited by mathematical procedures. In particular, for a logic system to be called symbolic, it must have symbolic representation for *logical relations*.

Nowadays, however, *symbolic logic* is synonymous with *formal logic* - the choice between these two phrase has most to do with the particular aspect one would like to emphasize - formalization or symbolization (even though they go hand in hand). *Informal logic* is primarily interested in studying fallacies in communication, stayling within the realm of natural languages since it doesn't require the use of symbols. Perhaps the systems of logic that are formal but don't use symbols exists, but it's hard to find examples.

In (t)his book, C. I. Lewis tries to define it: symbolic logic is the development of the most general principles of rational procedure, in ideographic symbols, and in a form which exhibits the connection of these principles one with another. But admits that "such general principles are likewise the subject matter of logic in any form".

The presentation of logic in mathematical form constitutes what we mean by symbolic logic. Hence the essential characteristies of symbolic logic are:
- its subject matter is the same as of any other logic system: the principles of rational procedure in general.
- its medium is an ideographic symbolism, in which each separate character represents a relatively simple and entirely explicit concept.
- variables (the terms of the system) having a definite range of significance to represent individuals or classes, relations, propositions, propositional functions.
- based on deduction so that many theorems may be derived from a few core principles, stated in symbols, using operations that are (or at least can be) precisely defined.
