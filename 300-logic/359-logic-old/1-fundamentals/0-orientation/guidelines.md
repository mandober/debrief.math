This section is about logic. Although it is a pile of articles related to logic, this section tries to organize the topics in a coherent manner suitable for the first encounter with the subject matter.

Coherent manner would be a presentation that starts with the most basic notions in logic and then organically builds upon them, with each introduced concept motivating the next one.

The most basic notion from which the logic proceeds in that of reasoning. Philosophy studies reasoning in general, but logic is concerned with logical reasoning, with the ways in which we derive new facts and with the aim to codify it and make it mechanizable.

This idea of codification of logical reasoning is at the core of the Lebnitz's vision of an universal language which people could use to resolve their arguments.



motivate the need to have a small, formal, symbolic language of logic; which, building on this from the aspect of CS, could even be though to computers. That in turn could be motivated by the need to have a better knowledge management systems and the possibility to store the entirety of human knowledge (for browsing, posterity, or whatever purpose). This then raises the question of tractability of such an attempt, or at least raises concerns about space complexity - with the concusion being that teaching computers how to reason properly could mean storing only a small core of facts and letting the computers derive others.

This segues into the kinds of logical reasoning, singling out deduction as the kind of reasoning that is mechanizable. People like Lebnitz have always wanted to get a tthe essentce of human reasoning, deeming, at least, duductive reasoning to be mechanize, expressable in a step by step manner and thus algorithmizable.

At this point I promise myself to stop dealing with the outlines of topics, making hierarchies and classifications, and to actually do one concrete topic before drifting off. I don't even know why I do this. These are supposed to be notes not exhaustive elaborations. Mention the essentials and sod off, don't stray.

Ideas that have always motivated logic is the identification of
