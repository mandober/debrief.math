# Logical symbol

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(formal)

In FOL, a formal language over an alphabet consisting of non-logical symbols and logical symbols. *Logical symbols* include logical connectives, quantifiers and variables.

The syntactic entities in a formal language: The symbols and strings of symbols may be broadly divided into nonsense and wffs. A formal language can be thought of as identical to its wff set. The wff set may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.

## Overview

Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols of anything. For instance, parentheses only serve as a punctuation. Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to some interpretation.

A symbol or string of symbols may comprise a well-formed formula if it is consistent with the formation rules of the language.

In a formal system, a symbol may be used as a token in formal operations. The set of formal symbols in a formal language is referred to as an alphabet.

A formal symbol as used in first-order logic may be a variable (ranging over the members of the universe), a constant, a function (mapping to another member of universe) or a predicate (mapping to a truth value).

Formal symbols are usually thought of as purely syntactic structures, composed into larger structures using a formal grammar, though sometimes they may be associated with an interpretation or model (a formal semantics).
