>**Argument to moderation** is the fallacy that the truth is supposedly always a compromise between two opposing positions.

Argument to moderation, aka
- argumentum ad temperantiam (Latin)
- fallacy of gray
- false compromise
- argument from middle ground
- the golden mean fallacy

An example is to consider two opposed arguments, one saying that the sky is green and another saying that it is blue, and then concluding that it is grue.
