A logical fallacy is an error of reasoning. When someone makes an argument based on bad reasoning, they are said to commit a fallacy. Weak, twisted, fallacious thinking keeps us from knowing the truth. Fallacies are so common (even among the brightest minds) that philosophers have been able to define these recurring mistakes and give each a name.
