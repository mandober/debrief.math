# Consequent - Wikipedia

A consequent is the second half of a hypothetical proposition.  In the standard form of such a proposition, it is the part that follows "then". In an implication, if P implies Q, then P is called the antecedent and Q is called the consequent.[1] In some contexts, the consequent is called the apodosis.[2]

Look up *__[consequent][1]__* in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

A __consequent__ is the second half of a hypothetical [proposition][2]. In the standard form of such a proposition, it is the part that follows "then". In an [implication][3], if *P* implies *Q*, then *P* is called the [antecedent][4] and *Q* is called the __consequent__.[\[1\]][5] In some contexts, the consequent is called the *__apodosis__*.[\[2\]][6]

Examples:

![Q](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/8752c7023b4b3286800fe3238271bbca681219ed) is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition.

Here, "![X](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab) is an animal" is the consequent.

-   If computers can think, then they are alive.

"They are alive" is the consequent.

The consequent in a hypothetical proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the antecedent.

-   If monkeys are purple, then fish speak Klingon.

"Fish speak Klingon" is the consequent here, but intuitively is not a consequence of (nor does it have anything to do with) the claim made in the antecedent that "monkeys are purple.
