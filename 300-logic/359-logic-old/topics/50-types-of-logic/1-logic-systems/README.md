# Logic :: Logic Systems

* Propositional logic
  - domain of discorse
  - logical constants
  - logical variables
  - logical connectives
  - propositions
    - atomic statements
    - compound statements (atoms with connectives)

* Predicate logic
  - domain of discorse
  - constants
  - logical connectives
  - quantifiers, ∀ and ∃
  - quantified variables
  - functions
  - predicates
    - relations
  - WFFs
    - literals
      - predicates, φ, ψ
      - negated predicates, ¬φ
    - predicates joined with connectives
      - φ ⋀ ψ
      - φ ⋁ ψ
      - φ -> ψ
      - φ <=> ψ
    - predicates with quantified variables
      - ∀x.φ
      - ∃x.φ
  - terms


* Zeroth-order logic
  - FOL without variables or quantifiers

* First-order logic
  - variables
  - quantifiers

* Second-order logic

* Higher-order logic
