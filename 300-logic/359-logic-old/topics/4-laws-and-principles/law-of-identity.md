# The law of identity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_identity

In logic, **the law of identity** states that each thing is identical to itself. Each thing, whether a universal or particular, is made up of own idiosyncratic set of properties - the essence that characterize it. The law of identity is the first of the 3 *laws of thought*, along with the law of noncontradiction, and the law of excluded middle.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz claimed that the law of identity, which he expresses as `"Everything is what it is"`, is the first primitive truth of reason which is affirmative, and the law of noncontradiction is the first negative truth, arguing that "the statement that a thing is what it is, is prior to the statement that it is not another thing". Wilhelm Wundt credits Gottfried Leibniz with the symbolic formulation, `"A is A"`.

*Leibniz's Law* is a similar principle: `x` is the same as `y` iff every predicate true of `x` is true of `y` as well. Or, two objects that have all the same properties, are in fact one and the same object, `P(x) ⟺ P(y) ⟺ x = y`.

## In modern logic

In first-order logic, identity (or equality) is represented as a two-place predicate, or relation, `=`. There, *identity is a relation on individuals*, not a relation between propositions, and is not concerned with the meaning of propositions, nor with equivocation.

The law of identity can be expressed as `∀x(x = x)`, where `x` is a variable ranging over the domain of all individuals.

In logic, there are various different ways identity can be handled. In *FOL with identity*, identity is treated as a logical constant and its axioms are part of the logic itself. Under this convention, the law of identity is a logical truth.

In *FOL without identity*, identity is treated as an interpretable predicate and its axioms are supplied by the theory. This allows a broader equivalence relation to be used that may allow `a = b` to be satisfied by distinct individuals `a` and `b`. Under this convention, a model is said to be normal when no distinct individuals a and b satisfy `a = b`.
