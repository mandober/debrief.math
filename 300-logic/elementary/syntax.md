# Syntax

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(logic)

Syntax is concerned with the rules (grammar) governing the manipulation of expressions that constitute the *well-formed formulas* (wff) of a formal system and its formal language.

A well-formed formula (wff) is a syntactically valid string in a formal language, as opposed to the myriad of other, nonsense, strings.

Syntactic entities of formal languages:
- symbol
- formula
- system
- theorem
- proof
- interpretation

Symbols and strings may be divided into nonsense and well-formed formulas. *A formal language is identical to the set of its well-formed formulas*. The wff set may be divided into *theorems* and *non-theorems*.
