# Theory and proof derivations

Transformation rules
- inference rules
- logic laws
- logic identities
- equivalence rules
  - p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q (classical logic, not intuitionistic)
- transformation rules
  - de Morgan's rules
  - associativity
    - conjunction
    - disjunction
  - commutativity
  - absorption
  - idempotence
  - distributivity
- precedence rules
- additional rules

Formal systems properties
- consistency
- soundness
- completeness

Proof derivations
- Logic systems
  - Hilbert system
  - natural deduction
  - sequent calculus
- Styles of proofs
  - tableau
  - Finch style
- Methods of proofs
  - direct proof
  - indirect proof
  - proof by cases
  - proof by contradiction



Symbols used in proof derivations
- `R`   for reiteration (restatement)
- `AS`  for assumption, possibly labelled, e.g. `AS¹`
- `DP`  for direct proof
- `IP`  for indirect proof
- `RAA` for Reductio ad absurduum
- `↯` or `→←` (or `⊥`) are symbols for contradiction
- `EFQ` for Ex falsum quidlibet or the principle of explosion
- `LEM` for the Law of Excluded Middle
- `LNC` for the Law of Non-contradiction
- `LID` for the Law of Identity


Formation, introduction and elimination inference rules in FOL for
- logical connectives (∧, ∨, ⇒, ¬)
- truth values (⊤, ⊥)
