## Absoluteness
Absoluteness is a property of a formula. A formula is said to be absolute if it has the same truth value in each class of structures/models.

## Ampliative
Ampliative (from Latin *ampliare*, "to enlarge") is a term used mainly in logic, meaning "extending" or "adding to that which is already known".
This term was often used by medieval logicians in the analyses of the temporal content of their subject terms. There were 3 rules outlined in its usage: 1) Common terms in a sentence only represent present things when they stand with a non-ampliating verb about the present; 2) A common term standing in a sentence with a verb about the past is able to stand for present and past things; 3) The common term standing with a verb about the future can indifferently stand for present and future things.

## Ancestral logic
Ancestral logic is the extension of FOL with a transitive closure operation (the transitive closure of a binary relation R on a set X is the smallest relation on X that contains R and is transitive).

## Anti-psychologism
Anti-psychologism or *logical objectivism* is the conviction that the rules of logic are mind-independent. *Objectivism* is a philosophical system created by Ayn Rand that declares real knowledge to be metaphysically objective. *Moral objectivism* or *moral realism*, the meta-ethical position that ethical sentences express factual propositions about robust or mind-independent features of the world, and that some such propositions are true.

## Argumentation theory
Argumentation theory, or argumentation, is the interdisciplinary study of how conclusions can be reached from premises through logical reasoning. It includes debate, dialogue, conversation, persuasion. It studies inference and procedural rules in artificial and real world settings.

## Aristotelian logic
see Term logic

## Assumption
initial premise

## Axiom
An axiom or postulate is a statement considered to always be true  that serves as an initial premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. In classical logics, an axiom is an evident and well-established statement. In modern logics, an axiom is a premise for reasoning.

## Biconditional
Biconditional (bidirectional implication, bijection) is a logical connective, symbolized by `‚ü∫` or `<->`, and usually read "if and only if", that marks two logical formulas as being logically equivalent, symbolically `p ‚ü∫ q`. Two formulas are logically equivalent if they imply each other, `p ‚ü∫ q ‚â° (p ‚Üí q) ‚ãÄ (q ‚Üí p)`. Here, `‚ü∫` denotes logical equality, while `‚â°` denotes syntactic equality (although they are frequently used interchangeably).

## Bijection
In logic, bijection is synonymous with biconditional. But in general math, bijection is a function or relation that is injective, `(dom = ran) < cod`, and surjective, `dom > (cod = ran)`.

## Bivalence
Bivalence is the property of two-value logics. The phrase "classically bivalent" sometimes also implies LEM although the two principles are distinct. A logic may admit LEM without being bivalent, and a logic may be bivalent without admitting LEM (intuitionistic logic).

## Boolean function
A Boolean function is a function whose arguments and result assume values from the Boolean domain, i.e. a two-element set, usually, `{T,F}` or `{0,1}`. Unary `f: ùîπ ‚Üí ùîπ`, binary `g: ùîπ ‚®Ø ùîπ ‚Üí ùîπ` or `g: ùîπ¬≤ ‚Üí ùîπ` or `g: ùîπ ‚Üí ùîπ ‚Üí ùîπ`, and in general `h: ùîπ‚Åø ‚Üí ùîπ`.

## Boolean logic
Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra where values of variables are the truth values 'true' and 'false' and the operators are logical connectives. Boolean algebra is a formal way of describing logical operations, in the same way that elementary algebra describes numerical operations. Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in 1847.

## Boolean algebra
Propositional logic may be reinterpreted from a viewpoint of algebra, in which case the system is called Boolean algebra (BA). Boolean algebra is an algebraic system on the Boolean domain, `ùîπ = {0, 1}`. A logical statement (a proposition) in propositional logic is regarded as an expression in Boolean algebra. Applications of inference rules to derive a theorem in logic are similar to transformations or manipulations of expressions in algebra. In BA, we can manipulate logical statements as algebraic expressions systematically.

## Boolean logic vs Propositional logic


## Bound variable
A bound variable has all of its application occurrences in the scope that is visible (accessible) from its binding occurrence (i.e. from its binding site).

A bound variable `x` has all of its application occurrences under the scope of `x`'s binding site.

## Binding occurrence
A variable's binding occurrence is the appearance of a variable inside a binding context. For example, the quantification context in predicate logic, `‚àÉxPx`, or the Œª-binder in lambda calculus, `(Œªxf.fxx)`. Usually, an identifier (the name of a variable) debuts in a binding context within an expression. In Œª-calculus, an identifier's (variable's) binding occurrence serves to declare a formal parameter (by stating a new name i.e. identifier in the bonding context). Later, when the enclosing function, `Œªxf.fxx`, gets applied to an argument like `Œªzwv.zv(wv)`, the parameter `x` will bind that argument, `x := `Œªzwv.zv(wv)`. From there on, any occurrence of the parameter `x` may be replaced with the bound argument:

```
FUN := (Œªxf.fxx)
ARG := (Œªzwv.zv(wv))

(FUN)(ARG)
= (Œªxf.fxx)(Œªzwv.zv(wv))

## Closed-world assumption
Closed-world assumption is a view that pressuposes that a statement that is true is also known to be true, and a statement not known to be true is false.

## Cogent
adj. comparative more cogent, superlative most cogent.    
Reasonable and convincing; based on evidence. 
Appealing to the intellect or powers of reasoning.

## Collation
Collation is a generalization of a word (string of symbols from an alphabet) as a means to present information in a structured manner. A collation is a structured alignment with certain placeholders that underpins the construction of a formal language. These placeholders may then be replaced by elements of an alphabet (symbols) of the language. A collation in the alphabet is one where all placeholders are replaced by symbols from that alphabet.

## Conjecture
An unproved statement that is believed true is called a conjecture. To be considered a conjecture, a statement must usually be proposed publicly, at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture, as with Goldbach's conjecture. Other famous conjectures include the Collatz conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis. On the other hand, Fermat's Last Theorem has always been known by that name, even before it was proved; it was never known as "Fermat's conjecture".

## Constants symbols
Logical constants (constant symbols) are strings of symbols that (are interpreted to) represent objects.

## Contingency
In philosophy and logic, contingency is the status of propositions that are neither true under every possible valuation (i.e. not tautologies), nor false under every possible valuation (i.e. not contradictions). A contingent proposition is neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.

## Deductive system
A deductive system for a logic, aka a *deductive apparatus* or *a logic*, is a set of logical axioms (or axiom schemata) and inference rules that are used to derive theorems within that system, and that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs.

## Defeasible inference
Defeasible inference is a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, reserving the right to retract their conclusions based on further evidence.

## Defeasible reasoning
Defeasible reasoning is rationally compelling but deductively invalid kind of reasoning.

## Dialetheism
Dialetheism is a view in phylosophy of logic which accepts the existence of contradictory propositions, i.e. proposition that are both true and false. More precisely, it is the belief that there can be a true statement whose negation is also true. Such statements are called "true contradictions", dialetheia, or nondualisms.

## Elementary theory
In mathematical logic, an elementary theory is a theory that involves axioms using only finitary first-order logic, without reference to set theory or using any axioms which have consistency strength equal to set theory.

## Equiconsistent
In mathematical logic, two theories are equiconsistent if the consistency of one theory implies the consistency of the other theory, and vice versa. In this case, they are, roughly speaking, "as consistent as each other".

## Extension
The extension of a predicate (a truth-valued function) is the set of tuples of values that, used as arguments, satisfy the predicate. Such a set of tuples is a relation.

## Extensionality
Extensionality refers to principles that judge objects to be equal if they have the same external properties, as opposed to intensionality, which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same. There are many predicates that are intensionally different but extensionally identical. For example, the expressions, 2+4 and 2*3, are extensionally equal (from outside), but intensionality different (from within).

## Extremal clause
The last clause of a structurally-inductive definition that specifies that nothing else, apart from the given rules, falls within the scope of the definition. For example, following a series of clauses that define wffs (e.g. if `p` and `q` are wffs then so is `p ‚ãÄ q`, and such), the extremal clause will proclaim that no other formula is a wffs.

## Fallacy
A fallacy is a logically incorrect way of reasoning, that undermines the legal arguments in order to paint them as logically invalid and unsound. A fallacy is the use of faulty metods of reasoning whether by accident or deliberately. A fallacious argument may deceive by appearing to be better than it really is. Fallacies are often committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception.

## First-order logic
Predicate logic uses quantified variables over objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets.

## Formal language
A formal language is a language that is defined by a formal system. Like languages in linguistics, formal languages generally have two aspects, syntax and semantics (sometimes also the third aspect, pragmatics). The syntax of a language is what the language looks like; formally, it is the set of possible expressions that are valid statements in the language. The semantics of a language defines the meaning of the statements of the language.

## Formal logic
Formal logic is the study of inference with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule i.e. a rule that is not about any particular thing or property.

## Formal system
A formal system is an abstract structure used for inferring theorems, starting from the set of axioms and according to a set of inference rules. This set of inference rules is the logical calculus of the formal system. A formal system may represent a well-defined system of abstract thought. There are various formal systems. For example, Hilbert-style calculi are characterized by favoring axioms over the rules of inference, as contrasted by sequent calculi. The term *formalism* is sometimes used as a near synonym for formal system, but it also refers to a style of notation (e.g. Fitch notation or Fitch formalism).

## Formula
The symbols of a formal language comprise its alphabet, and the combinations of the symbols produce formulas. However, since most such productions are gobbledygook, the formal grammar specifies how to recognize and build only the well-formed statements, i.e. the well-formed formulas.

## Free variable
A free variable is a variable that has only an application occurrence without a corresponding binding occurence anywhere within its scope.

An application occurrence of a variable is called free if it is not scoped under the variable's binding occurence .

has all of its application occurrences in the same scope as its binding occurrence.

## Truth-functional
A logical connective is truth-functional if the truth value of a compound sentence is a function of the truth-value of its sub-sentences; i.e. if the truth value of the compound sentence can be determined from its atoms. A class of connectives is truth-functional if each of its members is.

## Fuzzy logic
Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

## Higher-order logic
In HOL, quantification is also allowed over other language entities besides variables; second-order logic allows quantification over predicates. HOL allows quantification over variables, predicates, functions, relations, then over the sets of these entities, then over the sets of sets of these entities, and so on.

## Identity
- Leibniz's notion of equality
- Quine's dictum
- Law of identity

## Identity - Law of identity
The law of identity

## Identity - Quine's dictum
The Quine's dictum says: No entity without identity! To know a type of objects is to know what it means to identify representatives of the type. The collection of self-identifications (self-transformations) of a given object form a group.

## Identity of indiscernibles
Leibniz's notion of equality: given any `x` and `y`, `x = y` iff given any predicate `P`, `P(x)` = `P(y)`, `‚àÄxy(x ‚â° y ‚áî ‚àÄP(Px ‚â° Py))`.

## iff
see Biconditional

## Immediate inference
Immediate inference is the operation of drawing an inference from a single premise; an inference drawn from a single premise.

## Informal logic
Informal logic is the study of natural language arguments. The study of fallacies is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.

## Law of non-contradiction
The law of non-contradiction (LNC) states that a proposition cannot be simoultaneously true and false, `¬¨(p ‚ãÄ ¬¨p)` (it denies the case where a proposition `p` is both true and false, which makes `p` a contradiction). LNC is the cornerstone of classical logic, but it is rejected in intuitionistic logic. LNC is logically equivalent to the LEM, i.e. `¬¨(p ‚ãÄ ¬¨p) ‚â° ¬¨p ‚ãÅ p` and to the law of identity, `¬¨(p ‚ãÄ ¬¨p) ‚â° p -> p`.

## Law of Identity
The Law of Identity (ID), admitted in all logics ‚ü®unconfirmed‚ü©, states that every proposition (every formula) entails itself. So `P -> P` is a tautology. This is actually a meta-formula, since `P` stands there for any wff - it can be instantitated to, e.g. `(a ‚à® b ‚Üí c) -> (a ‚à® b ‚Üí c)`.

The ID may also appear as an explicit axiom (a rule of inference without premises) in a logic system. Since it doesn't require any premises, it can always be introduced "out of the thin air".

In some systems of logic, we start a derivation in a top-down manner by first introducing an arbitrary identity formula justified by this rule. Then we derive the subsequent formulas using inference rules until we finally arrive at the conclusion. We can make progress in a derivation because ID is not the only rule that allows the introducion of more arbitrary formulas; for example, the weakening rule also lets us add a formula as a disjunct to an existing formula.

## Law of excluded middle
The Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) states that for every proposition, either it or its negation is true.

The principle should not be confused with the semantical principle of bivalence, which states that every proposition is either true or false. The principle of bivalence always implies the law of excluded middle, while the converse is not always true. A commonly cited counterexample uses statements unprovable now, but provable in the future to show that the law of excluded middle may apply when the principle of bivalence fails.

that the truth value of a proposition must be either true or false, which is usually denoted by `p ‚ãÅ ¬¨p`. 

LEM doesn't allow for any other possibility (like 'unknown' or N/A). LEM is the cornerstone of classical logic, but it is rejected in intuitionistic logic.

## Laws of thought
Laws of thought are the 3 fundamental laws, *the law of identity*, *the law of non-contradiction* and *the law of excluded middle*, often considered as the basis of rational discourse itself. These rules have been known and accepted in logic for centuries, until the modern logicians placed them under detailed scrutiny, which resulted in inventions of new kinds of logic that exercised strict control regarding the three fundamental laws.

## Logic
Logic is the study of rules of inference that allow deriving a conclusion from premises.

## Logical Connectives
Logical connectives (logical operators) are symbols or words used to connect sentences in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective. Logical connectives include negation (¬¨), conjunction (‚àß), inclusive disjunction (‚à®), exclusive disjunction (‚äï), biconditional (‚áî), implication (‚áí), NAND (‚Üë), NOR (‚Üì), sometimes even parentheses.

## Logical Consequence
Logical consequence (also **entailment**) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises.

## Logical Form
A logical form of a syntactic expression is a precisely-specified semantic version of that expression in a formal system. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly ambiguous statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system.

The concept of logical form is central to logic: the validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. A logical form of a syntactic expression is a precisely specified semantic version of that expression in a formal system. It is the formalization of possibly ambiguous statements from a natural language into, often symbolic, statements with precise unambiguous interpretation - their logical form.

## Logical Framework
Logical Framework provides a means to define a logic as a signature in a higher-order type theory in such a way that provability of a formula in the original logic reduces to a type inhabitation problem in the framework type theory.

## Logical positivism
The positivist view was that a statement about the world could be meaningful iff it is either empirically verifiable or it can be shown to be true through logical analysis of its symbols.

## Logical Truth
Logical truth is one of the most fundamental concepts in logic, and there are different theories on its nature. A logical truth is a statement which is true, and remains true under all reinterpretations of its components other than its logical constants.

## Mathematical logic
Mathematical logic is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of model theory, proof theory, set theory, and computability (recursion) theory.

## Metalogic
Metalogic is the study of the metatheory of logic. Whereas logic studies how logical systems can be used to construct valid and sound arguments, metalogic studies the properties of logical systems.

## Metatheorem
A metatheorem is a statement about a formal system proven in a metalanguage. Unlike theorems proved within a given formal system, a metatheorem is proved within a metatheory, and may reference concepts that are present in the metatheory but not the object theory.

## Monotonicity
Monotonicity is a property of relations (and functions) that relates

Having the property of never increasing or never decreasing as the values of independent variables change.

For example, a monotonic function between ordered sets can preserve (or reverse) the given order; for a *monotonically increasing* function it holds that whenever `x <= y`, then so is `f x <= f y`; but for a *monotonically decreasing* function whenever `x <= y` then `f x >= f y` (it reverses the order).

A *logical connective is monotonic* if flipping one input, with the other input remaining the same, also flips the result.

## Na√Øve theory
A theory qualified with the adjective "na√Øve" is an unformalized theory, presented using natural language.

## Natural deduction
In logic and proof theory, natural deduction is a kind of *proof calculus* in which logical reasoning is expressed by inference rules, closely related to the "natural" way of reasoning. In contrast to Hilbert-style systems that use axioms as much as possible to express the logical laws of deductive reasoning, natural deduction favors inference rules over axioms (even if an axiom is just an inference rule without assumptions).

## Necessity and sufficiency
In logic, necessity and sufficiency are terms used to describe an implicational relationship between statements. The assertion that one statement is a necessary and sufficient condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true.

## Non-classical logic
Non-classical logics (and sometimes alternative logics) are formal systems that differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as propositional and predicate logic. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations.

## Objectivism
Objectivism is a philosophical system created by Ayn Rand that declares real knowledge to be metaphysically objective. *Moral objectivism* or *moral realism*, the meta-ethical position that ethical sentences express factual propositions about robust or mind-independent features of the world, and that some such propositions are true. *Anti-psychologism* or *logical objectivism* is the conviction that the rules of logic are mind-independent.

## Occurrence typing
Occurrence typing is a typing discipline that assigns to an occurrence of a variable a subtype, derived from the declared type based on the predicates encountered prior to that variable occurrence.

## Ontological commitment
An ontological commitment of a language are objects postulated to exist by that language. This need not be "real existence", but only an existence in the universe of discourse. For example, legal systems use terms like "legal persons" to descibe collective entities that have rights; so, the legal doctrine has an ontological commitment to non-singular individuals.

## Open-world assumption
Open-world assumption is a view that the truth value of a statement may be true irrespective of whether or not it is known to be true.

## Philosophical logic
Understood in a narrow sense, philosophical logic is the area of philosophy that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems, often in the form of extended logical systems like modal logic. In a wider sense, it is conceived as the study of the scope and nature of logic in general. In this sense, philosophical logic can be seen as identical to the *philosophy of logic*, which includes additional topics like how to define logic or a discussion of the fundamental concepts of logic.

## Philosophy of logic
Following the developments in formal logic with symbolic logic in the late nineteenth century and mathematical logic in the twentieth, topics traditionally treated by logic not being part of formal logic have tended to be termed either philosophy of logic or philosophical logic if no longer simply logic. Compared to the history of logic the demarcation between philosophy of logic and philosophical logic is of recent coinage and not always entirely clear.

## Predicate
A predicate is a statement that takes argument variables, which range over the elements of the domain of discourse, and maps them to a truth value. In the case there are two such input variables, such a predicate is called a (binary) predicate or a (binary) relation. A unary predicate is often called a property. Predicates of larger arity may also be called relations.

If a predicate `P` marks the property "is divisible by 2", then `P(x)` is a statement of one variable `x`. However, the DOD must be specified so we know what individuals this variable ranges over. For example, if used inside a set builder notation like `ùîº = { x | ‚àÄx ‚àà ‚Ñï. P(x) }`, it indicates that a natural number `x` belongs to the set `ùîº` if `P(x)` holds.

## Predicate symbol
Predicates are represented by a predicate symbol used to denote properties of objects and relations between them. Each predicate has an associated arity. Unary predicates represent positive or negative properties of objects. For example, `œÜ(x)` could mean that an object `x` is an odd number, i.e. `x` has a property of being odd. Polyadic predicates represent relations between objects, possibly denoted by `R(x,y)`, or `xRy` for binary relations. Common binary relations frequently have own dedicated infix symbol, e.g. `x <= y`.

## Premise
A premise is a statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion. A premise is an assumption that something is true.

## Prenex normal form
A formula of the predicate calculus is in prenex normal form if it is written as a string of quantifiers and bound variables, called the prefix, followed by a quantifier-free part, called the matrix.

## Primitive notion
In mathematics, a primitive notion is an undefined concept, not defined in terms of previously defined concepts, to be taken for granted. It lacks a proof, and in that regard it's analogous to an axiom of a formal system (axioms don't require proof). Sometimes the primitive notions cannot be avoided because we need to start somewhere lest regress into downward spiral of definitions, forever defining concept in terms of previously defined concept, which also need definition in terms of previous ones, and so on, ad nauseum. Sometimes a concept just doesn't have a formal definition (e.g. "set").

## Primitive symbol
Primitive symbols comprise the alphabet of a formal language. The "primitive" qualifier is sometimes used in order to distinguish them from other symbols, which are either syntactical abbreviations or symbols defined in terms of the primitive ones.

## Principle of bivalence
The principle of bivalence states that every proposition has exactly one of the two truth value - it is either true or false.

## Proof by exhaustion
Proof by exhaustion (aka proof by cases, proof by case analysis, complete induction, brute force method) is a method of mathematical proof in which the statement to be proved is split into a finite number of cases or sets of equivalent cases and each type of case is checked to see if the proposition in question holds. This is a method of direct proof.

## Proof calculus
In mathematical logic, a proof calculus or a proof system is built to prove statements. Usually a given proof calculus encompasses more than a single particular formal system, since many proof calculi are under-determined and can be used for radically different logics. For example, a paradigmatic case is the sequent calculus, which can be used to express the consequence relations of both intuitionistic logic and relevance logic. Thus, loosely speaking, a proof calculus is a template or design pattern, characterized by a certain style of formal inference, that may be specialized to produce specific formal systems, namely by specifying the actual inference rules for such a system. There is no consensus among logicians on how best to define the term.

## Proof system
In mathematical logic, a proof calculus or a proof system is built to prove statements. A proof system includes these components: *Language* - the set of formulas admitted by the system (e.g propositional logic or FOL); *Rules of inference* - list of rules that can be employed to prove theorems from axioms and theorems; *Axioms* - formulas in the language assumed to be valid. All theorems are derived from axioms.

## Propositions
Propositions are declarative sentences that have a truth value.

## Propositional logic
Propositional (sentential) logic is based on propositions and argument flow. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. The propositions without logical connectives are called atomic propositions. Unlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.

## Proposition
Propositions (declarative sentences, statements) occur in both natural and formal languages, but wherever they appear we can always discus their truth value, i.e. whether they are true or false. In both kinds of languages, we can distinguish between *atomic (primitive) propositions* that don't contain connectives and cannot be decomposed further, and *compound (composite) propositions* that are build by joining atomic propositions with connectives (and, or, either‚Ä¶or, but, if‚Ä¶then, if and only if, etc.). The truth value of a compound proposition depends on the truth value of contained atomic propositions and particular connectives.

## Psychologism
The explanation or derivation of mathematical or logical laws in terms of psychological facts. Psychologism is a family of philosophical positions, according to which certain psychological notions play a central role in grounding or explaining certain non-psychological notions. Psychologism is a view or doctrine that a theory of psychology or ideas forms the basis of an account of metaphysics, epistemology, or meaning. John Stuart Mill was accused by Edmund Husserl of being an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, although this may not have been the case. Psychologism was notably criticized by Gottlob Frege in his anti-psychologistic work "The Foundations of Arithmetic", and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl's "Philosophy of Arithmetic". Husserl, in the first volume of his "Logical Investigations", called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. Frege's arguments were largely ignored, while Husserl's were widely discussed.

## Rule of inference
Rules of inference are syntactical transformation rules which one can use to infer a conclusion from a premise to create an argument. A set of rules can be used to infer any valid conclusion if it is complete, while never inferring an invalid conclusion, if it is sound.

## Second-order Logic
Second-order logic is an extension of first-order logic, which itself is an extension of propositional logic. Second-order logic is in turn extended by higher-order logic and type theory. First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals (elements of the domain of discourse), second-order logic additionally quantifies over relations.

## Semantics
Semantics, by contrast to syntax, has meaning as its primary concern. It is the study of the truth, reference, and linguistic meaning that can attach to linguistic expressions.

## Statement
In logic, the term statement is variously understood to mean either: (a) a meaningful declarative sentence that is true or false, or (b) the assertion that is made by a true or false declarative sentence.In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement.

## Strict conditional
In logic, a strict conditional (strict implication) is a conditional governed by a modal operator, that is, a logical connective of modal logic. It is logically equivalent to the material conditional of classical logic, combined with the necessity operator from modal logic.

## Substitution
Substitution is a fundamental concept in logic. A substitution is a syntactic transformation on formal expressions.

## Syllogisms
A syllogism is a kind of logical argument where a quantified statement of a specific form (the conclusion) is inferred from two other quantified statements (the premises). It is a logical argument where one starts with premises and reaches a conclusion. A syllogism is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true. In its earliest form, defined by Aristotle, from the combination of a general statement (the major premise) and a specific statement (the minor premise), a conclusion is deduced.

## Syllogistic logic
see Term logic

## Symbolic logic
A formalized system consisting of primitive symbols, combinations of these symbols, axioms, and rules of inference. Symbolic logic studies symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference. It is often divided into propositional and predicate logic, as its two main branches. Practically, it is synonymous with formal logic, mathematical logic, modern logic.

## Syntax
Syntax, by contrast to semantics, is the study of linguistic expressions abstracted from any meaning they may have. The expressions are understood as mere strings of characters.

## System of logic
In the most general sense, a system of logic is a set endowed with a logical consequence relation. Translattions between logical systems are morphisms that preserce the logical consequence relation.

## Tacit assumption
A tacit or implicit assumption is an assumption that underlies a logical argument, course of action, decision, or judgment that is not explicitly voiced nor necessarily understood by the decision maker or judge. These assumptions may be made based on personal life experiences, and are not consciously apparent in the decision making environment. These assumptions can be the source of apparent paradoxes, misunderstandings and resistance to change in human organizational behavior.

## Theorem
A theorem is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements (other theorems) and generally accepted statements (axioms). It is a logical consequence of the axioms.

## Term logic
Term logic (traditional logic, syllogistic logic, Aristotelian logic) is a system of formal logic mainly concerned with the syllogistic forms of deduction that is based on Aristotle and includes some of the changes and elaborations made by the Stoics and the Scholastics.

## Traditional logic

## Truth value
A truth value of a proposition is something that is up for discussion. A truth value (or logical value) is a value indicating the relation of a proposition to the truth. A proposition has a truth value if it evaluates to true or false (in bivalence logics). However, there are many non-binary systems of logic, that have 3 (false, unknown, true) or more truth values. In fuzzy logic, for instance, truth value is represented by a real number in the inteval (0,1).

## Unique name assumption
Unique name assumption is a simplifying assumption made in some ontology languages and description logics. In logics with the unique name assumption, different names always refer to different entities in the world.

## Universally valid
Valid in every structure that satisfies a particular set of axioms.

## Universal-existential normal form
It is a special case of the prenex normal form where every universal quantifier precedes any existential quantifier.

## Validity
In logic, an argument is valid iff it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false. It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true, but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion.

## Variable symbols
Variables are used as placeholders for quantifying over objects.

## Variable occurrences
A variable, or more precisely, an identifier that identifies it (label, identifier, variable name) can appear any number of times within an expression. Here, however, expressions are taken to be somewhat more orderly constructs that appear as functions or abstractions in lambda calculus, or as logical expressions (formulas, sentences) in predicate logic. In fact, in predicate logic, a sentence is a formula without free variables - such formulas collect all the interest. 


Predicate logic has quantifiers, lambda calculus has lambda-binders, and both serve a similar purpose - they are places intended for parameter declaration. Sometimes, the term "variable" is taken as the most general "container" that includes "parameters". Then, the term "parameter" is used to refer only to *local variables*, i.e. variables that are local to a function or a logical expression.

has 2 types of "occurrences" in an expression. Any variable has at most one *binding occurence*

An occurrence of a variable is any appearance of the varaible following its binding occurrence.

## Weakening
The weakening rule, one of the structural rules that operate directly on the structure of a deduction system, states that the hypotheses or conclusion of a sequent may be extended with additional members and still remain valid.

## Well-formed formula
Let `F` be a formal language whose alphabet is `A`. A well-formed formula (WFF) is a collation in `A` which can be built by using the rules of formation of the formal grammar of `F`. That is, a collation in `A` is a well-formed formula in `F` iff it has a parsing sequence in `F`.

Less formally, a formal language's alphabet consists of symbols, and they are combined to build formulas. However, since most such productions are gobbledygook, the formal grammar decides which of these are well-formed and thus called well-formed formulas.

Semantically, WFFs are symbolic representations of logical statements. For example, in math, the two most universal types of logical formula are propositional formulas and first-order formulas.
