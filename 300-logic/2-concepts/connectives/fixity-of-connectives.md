# Fixity of logical connectives

Fixity of logical connectives is
- associativity of logical connectives, and
- precedence of logical connectives

## Associativity of logical connectives

All logical connectives associate to the right except implication (→), and the other, rarely  used, implicational connectives (→, ←, ⇍, ⇏).

## Precedence of logical connectives

Negation (¬) binds the most tight.
