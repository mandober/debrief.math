This is a demo of a *proof checker* for *Fitch-style natural deduction systems* found in many popular introductory logic textbooks. The specific system used here is the one found in `forall x: Calgary`. Although based on `forall x: an Introduction to Formal Logic`, the proof system in that original version differs from the one used here and in `forall x: Calgary`. However, the system also supports the rules used in the `forall x: Cambridge remix`.
