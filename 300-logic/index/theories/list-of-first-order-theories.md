# List of first-order theories

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first-order_theories

In first-order logic, a first-order theory is given by a set of axioms in a particular formal language. This is a list of common first-order theories and their properties.

## Preliminaries

For every natural mathematical structure, there is a signature `σ` listing the constants, functions and relations of the theory, together with their arities, so that the object is naturally a σ-structure.

Given a signature `σ`, there is a unique first-order language `Lσ` that can be used to capture the first-order expressible facts about the σ-structure.

There are two common ways to specify theories:
* List or describe a set of sentences in the language `Lσ`, called the axioms of the theory.
* Give a set of σ-structures and define a theory to be the set of sentences in `Lσ` holding in all these models; e.g. the "theory of finite fields" consists of all sentences in the language of fields that are true in all finite fields.

An `Lσ` theory may be:
- *consistent*: no proof of contradiction exists
- *satisfiable*: there exists a σ-structure for which the sentences of the theory are all true (by the completeness theorem, satisfiability is equivalent to consistency)
- *complete* (for any statement, either it or its negation is provable)
- have quantifier elimination
- eliminate imaginaries
- finitely axiomatizable
- decidable (there is an algorithm to decide which statements are provable)
- recursively axiomatizable
- model complete or sub-model complete
- κ-categorical (all models of cardinality κ are isomorphic)
- stable or unstable
- ω-stable (same as totally transcendental for countable theories)
- superstable
- have an atomic model
- have a prime model
- have a saturated model
