# Proof calculi

Proof calculi
- Hilbert-style systems
- natural deduction
- Aristotle's syllogistic calculus (from the Organon)
- Frege's two-dimensional notation (in the 'Begriffsschrift', 1879)
- C.S. Peirce's existential graph
- proof nets
- cirquent calculus
- sequent calculus

Classical proof calculi
- Hilbert systems, of which the most famous example is the 1928 Hilbert-Ackermann system of first-order logic
- Gerhard Gentzen's calculus of natural deduction, which is the first formalism of structural proof theory, and which is the cornerstone of the formulae-as-types correspondence relating logic to FP
- Gentzen's sequent calculus, which is the most studied formalism of structural proof theory


Proof theory
- Hilbert-style systems
- natural deduction
- sequent calculus

Structural proof theory
- Gerhard Gentzen's calculus of natural deduction
- display logic
- hypersequents
- calculus of structures
- calculus of bunched implication
