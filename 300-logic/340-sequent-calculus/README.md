# Logic :: Sequent Calculus :: Rules of Inference

Any proof calculus has axioms, rules of inference, and possibly structural rules (e.g. sequent calculus). Axioms may also be considered rules of inference since an axiom ineed is a rule of inference without premises.

Assumption (aka the `I axiom`, identity rule) is a rule of inference (or an axiom since it has no premises) which states that any formula implies itself, `A → A`, it is a tautology, `A → A ≡ ⊤`. It is admissible in any logic system; in sequent calculus, it is the only axiom (there, it is called an initial rule).
