    proof by cases

* laws of logic
  - law of noncontradiction,        `p ⋀ ¬p -> ⟘`
  - law of bivalence,               `p ⋁ ¬p = ¬(¬p ⋀ p)`
  - law of excluded middle (LEM),   `p ⋁ ¬p`
  - true statement is implied by every statement, `a -> a`
  - peirce's law
    - Peirce's law implies law of excluded middle,          `pl -> lem`
    - law of excluded middle implies Peirce's law,          `lem -> pl`
    - Peirce's law is equivalent to law of excluded middle, `pl <=> lem`
