# Equivocation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation

In logic, equivocation (calling two different things by the same name) is an informal fallacy resulting from the use of a particular word/expression in multiple senses within an argument.

It is a type of ambiguity that stems from a phrase having two or more distinct meanings, not from the grammar or structure of the sentence.
