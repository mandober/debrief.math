# Non-logical symbol

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-logical_symbol

A formal logic language consist of symbols, broadly divided into *variables* and *constants*. Constants can further be divided into *logical symbols* (logical constants) and *non-logical symbols* (non-logical constants).

* Formal language
  - variables
  - constants
    - logical symbols
    - non-logical symbols

* Non-logical symbols in FOL
  - predicates
  - individual constants

* FOL logical symbols - logical constants
  - individual constants
  - variables
  - functions
  - predicates

* FOL formal language
  - logical symbols
    - connectives
    - quantifiers
    - variables
  - non-logical symbols



The *non-logical symbols* of a language of first-order logic consist of `predicates` and `individual constants`. These include symbols that, in an interpretation, may stand for *individual constants*, *variables*, *functions*, or *predicates*.

A FOL formal language over the alphabet consisting of its *non-logical symbols* and its *logical symbols*. The logical symbols include logical connectives, quantifiers, and variables that stand for statements.

A *non-logical symbol* only has meaning or semantic content when one is assigned to it by means of an interpretation. Consequently, a sentence containing a non-logical symbol lacks meaning except under an interpretation, so a sentence is said to be true or false under an interpretation.

The *logical constants*, by definition, have the same meaning in all interpretations. They include the symbols for truth-functional connectives and the symbols for the quantifiers.

The *equality symbol* is sometimes treated as a non-logical symbol and sometimes treated as a symbol of logic. If it is treated as a logical symbol, then any interpretation will be required to interpret the equality sign using true equality; if interpreted as a non-logical symbol, it may be interpreted by an arbitrary equivalence relation.
