# Presupposition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presupposition

In pragmatics (a branch of linguistics), a **presupposition** (or PSP) is an *implicit assumption* about the world or background belief relating to an utterance whose truth is taken for granted in discourse.

Examples of presuppositions include:
- "Jane no longer writes fiction." Presupposition: Jane once wrote fiction.
- "Have you stopped eating meat?" Presupposition: you had once eaten meat.
- "Have you talked to Hans?" Presupposition: Hans exists.

A presupposition must be mutually known or assumed by the speaker and addressee for the utterance to be considered appropriate in context. It will generally remain a necessary assumption whether the utterance is placed in the form of an assertion, denial, or question, and can be associated with a specific lexical item or grammatical feature (presupposition trigger) in the utterance.

Crucially, negation of an expression does not change its presuppositions: "I want to do it again" and "I don't want to do it again" both presuppose that the subject has done it already one or more times; "My wife is pregnant" and "My wife is not pregnant" both presuppose that the subject has a wife. In this respect, presupposition is distinguished from *entailment* and *implicature*. For example, "The president was assassinated" entails that "The president is dead", but if the expression is negated, the entailment is not necessarily true.
