# Logical constant - Wikipedia

In logic, a logical constant of a language  is a symbol that has the same semantic value under every interpretation of . Two important types of logical constants are logical connectives and quantifiers.  The equality predicate (usually written '=') is also treated as a logical constant in many systems of logic.
In [logic][1], a __logical constant__ of a [language][2] ![{\mathcal {L}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c) is a [symbol][3] that has the same [semantic value][4] under every [interpretation][5] of ![{\mathcal {L}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9027196ecb178d598958555ea01c43157d83597c). Two important types of logical constants are [logical connectives][6] and [quantifiers][7]. The [equality][8] predicate (usually written '=') is also treated as a logical constant in many [systems of logic][9].

One of the fundamental questions in the [philosophy of logic][10] is "What is a logical constant?"; that is, what special feature of certain constants makes them *logical* in nature?[\[1\]][11]

Some symbols that are commonly treated as logical constants are:

Symbol

Meaning in English

T

"true"

F

"[false][12]"

¬

"[not][13]"

∧

"[and][14]"

∨

"[or][15]"

→

"[implies][16]", "if...then"

∀

"[for all][17]"

∃

"[there exists][18]", "for some"

\=

"[equals][19]"

![\Box ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/029b77f09ebeaf7528fc831fe57848be51f2240b)

"necessarily"

![\Diamond ](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/1e5e6f31a91de53f443e2cd4c7478693a1a6a57b)

"possibly"

Many of these logical constants are sometimes denoted by alternate symbols (*e.g.*, the use of the symbol "&" rather than "∧" to denote the [logical and][20]).

Defining logical constants is a major part of the work of [Gottlob Frege][21] and [Bertrand Russell][22]. Russell returned to the subject of logical constants in the preface to the second edition (1937) of *[The Principles of Mathematics][23]* noting that logic becomes linguistic: "If we are to say anything definite about them, \[they\] must be treated as part of the language, not as part of what the language speaks about."[\[2\]][24] The text of this book uses [relations][25] R, their [converses][26] and [complements][27] as [primitive notions][28], also taken as logical constants in the form aRb.
