# Formal system

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_system

A *formal system* is an abstract structure used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the logical calculus of the formal system. A formal system is essentially an "axiomatic system".

In 1921, David Hilbert proposed to use such a system as the foundation for the knowledge in mathematics. A formal system may represent a well-defined system of abstract thought.

The term "formalism" is sometimes a rough synonym for formal system, but it also refers to a given style of notation (for example, Paul Dirac's bra-ket notation).
