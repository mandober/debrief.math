# Law of noncontradiction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction

In logic, **the law of non-contradiction** (LNC) states that contradictory propositions cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time.

LNC is also known as the law/principle of non/contradiction.

Two propositions "p is true" (`p`) and "p is not true" (`¬p`) are mutually exclusive, which can be formally expressed as the tautology `¬(p ⋀ ¬p)`.

Despite being logically equivalent, LNC should not be confused with **the law of excluded middle** (LEM), which states that *at least* one proposition holds ("p is true" or "p is not true"), formally expressed as `p ⋁ ¬p`.

One reason to have this law is **the principle of explosion** (`⟘ -> p`) , which states that anything follows from a contradiction. The law is employed in a *reductio ad absurdum* proof.

To express the fact that the law is tenseless and to avoid *equivocation*, sometimes the law is amended to say "contradictory propositions cannot both be true 'at the same time and in the same sense'".

It is one of the so called three laws of thought, along with its complement, the law of excluded middle, and the law of identity. However, no system of logic is built on just these laws, and none of these laws provide inference rules, such as modus ponens or De Morgan's laws.

The law of non contradiction and the law of excluded middle create a dichotomy in "logical space", wherein the two parts are "mutually exclusive" and "jointly exhaustive". The law of non-contradiction is merely an expression of the mutually exclusive aspect of that dichotomy, and the law of excluded middle, an expression of its jointly exhaustive aspect.
