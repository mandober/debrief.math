# Downward entailing - Wikipedia

In linguistic semantics, a downward entailing (DE) propositional operator is one that constrains the meaning of an expression to a lower number or degree than would be possible without the expression.  For example, "not", "nobody", "few people", "at most two boys". Conversely, an upward-entailing operator constrains the meaning of an expression to a higher number or degree, for example "more than one".  A context that is neither downward nor upward entailing is non-monotone[citation needed], such as "exactly five".
In [linguistic][1] [semantics][2], a __downward entailing__ (__DE__) propositional operator is one that constrains the meaning of an expression to a lower number or degree than would be possible without the expression. For example, "not", "nobody", "few people", "at most two boys". Conversely, an __upward-entailing__ operator constrains the meaning of an expression to a higher number or degree, for example "more than one". A context that is neither downward nor upward entailing is *non-monotone*\[*[citation needed][3]*\], such as "exactly five".

A downward-entailing operator reverses the relation of *semantic strength* among expressions. An expression like "run fast" is semantically *stronger* than the expression "run" since "John ran fast" [entails][4] "John ran", but not conversely. But a downward-entailing context reverses this strength; for example, the proposition "At most two boys ran" entails that "At most two boys ran fast" but not the other way around.

An upward-entailing operator preserves the relation of semantic strength among a set of expressions; for example "more than three ran fast" entails "more than three ran" but not the other way around.

Ladusaw (1980) proposed that downward entailment is the property that licenses [polarity items][5]. Indeed, "Nobody saw *anything*" is downward entailing and admits the negative polarity item *anything*, while \*"I saw *anything*" is ungrammatical (the upward-entailing context does not license such a polarity item). This approach explains many but not all typical cases of polarity item sensitivity. Subsequent attempts to describe the behavior of polarity items rely on a broader notion of [nonveridicality][6].

## Strawson-DE\[[edit][7]\]

Downward entailment does not explain the licensing of *any* in certain contexts such as with *only*:

Only John ate any vegetables for breakfast.

This is not a downward-entailing context because the above proposition does not entail “Only John ate kale for breakfast” (John may have eaten spinach, for example).

Von Fintel (1999) claims that although *only* does not exhibit the classical DE pattern, it can be shown to be DE in a special way. He defines a notion of Strawson-DE for expressions that come with [presuppositions][8]. The reasoning scheme is as follows:

1.  P → Q
2.  \[\[ only John \]\] (P) is defined.
3.  \[\[ only John \]\] (Q) is true.
4.  Therefore, \[\[ only John \]\] (P) is true.

Here, (2) is the intended presupposition. For example:

1.  Kale is a vegetable.
2.  Somebody ate kale for breakfast.
3.  Only John ate any vegetables for breakfast.
4.  Therefore, only John ate kale for breakfast.

Hence *only* is a Strawson-DE and therefore licenses *any*.

Giannakidou (2002) argues that Strawson-DE allows not just the presupposition of the evaluated sentence but just any arbitrary proposition to count as relevant. This results in over-generalization that validates the use if *any* in contexts where it is, in fact, ungrammatical, such as [clefts][9], preposed exhaustive [focus][10], and *each*/*both*:

\* It was John who talked to *anybody*.

\* John talked to *anybody*.

\* Each student who saw anything reported to the Dean.

\* Both students who saw anything reported to the Dean.
