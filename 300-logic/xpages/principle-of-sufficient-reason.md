The principle of sufficient reason, first written by Leibniz, states that everything must have a reason or a cause.

The principle was articulated and made prominent by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, with many antecedents, and was further used and developed by Arthur Schopenhauer and Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet.
