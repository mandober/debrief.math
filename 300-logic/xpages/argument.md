# Argument

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument

In logic, an **argument** is composed of a series of statements, called the [[premise|premises]], intended to determine the [truth value] of another statement, the [conclusion].

The [logical form] of an argument in a [natural language] can be represented in a [symbolic formal language], and independently of natural language formally defined "arguments" can be made in math and computer science.

Logic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments.

[Deductive arguments] can be [valid], and the valid ones can be [sound]: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if some premises are false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premises necessitate a true conclusion.

[Inductive arguments], by contrast, can have different degrees of [logical strength]: the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability.

The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truth - for example, the persuasiveness of so-called "indispensability claims" in transcendental arguments, the quality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.
