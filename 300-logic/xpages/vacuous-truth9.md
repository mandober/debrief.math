# Vacuous truth - Wikipedia

In mathematics and logic, a vacuous truth is a conditional or universal statement (a universal statement that can be converted to a conditional statement) that is true because the antecedent cannot be satisfied.[1] For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" will be true when no cell phones are in the room. In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned on" would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: "all cell phones in the room are turned on and turned off", which would otherwise be incoherent and false. For that reason, it is sometimes said that a statement is vacuously true because it does not really say anything.[2]
In [mathematics][1] and [logic][2], a __vacuous truth__ is a [conditional][3] or [universal][4] [statement][5] (a universal statement that can be converted to a conditional statement) that is true because the [antecedent][6] cannot be [satisfied][7].[\[1\]][8] For example, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned off" will be [true][9] when no cell phones are in the room. In this case, the statement "all cell phones in the room are turned *on*" would also be vacuously true, as would the [conjunction][10] of the two: "all cell phones in the room are turned on *and* turned off", which would otherwise be incoherent and false. For that reason, it is sometimes said that a statement is vacuously true because it does not really say anything.[\[2\]][11]

More formally, a relatively [well-defined][12] usage refers to a conditional statement (or a universal conditional statement) with a false [antecedent][13].[\[1\]][14][\[3\]][15][\[2\]][16][\[4\]][17] One example of such a statement is "if [London][18] is in [France][19], then the [Eiffel Tower][20] is in [Bolivia][21]".

Such statements are considered vacuous truths, because the fact that the antecedent is false prevents using the statement to infer anything about the truth value of the [consequent][22]. In essence, a conditional statement, that is based on the [material conditional][23], is true when the antecedent ("London is in France" in the example) is false regardless of whether the conclusion or [consequent][24] ("the Eiffel Tower is in Bolivia" in the example) is true or false because the material conditional is defined in that way.

Examples common to everyday speech include conditional phrases like "when hell freezes over..." and "when pigs can fly...", indicating that not before the given (impossible) condition is met will the speaker accept some respective (typically false or absurd) proposition.

In [pure mathematics][25], vacuously true statements are not generally of interest by themselves, but they frequently arise as the base case of proofs by [mathematical induction][26].[\[5\]][27] This notion has relevance in [pure mathematics][28], as well as in any other field that uses [classical logic][29].

Outside of mathematics, statements which can be characterized informally as vacuously true can be misleading. Such statements make reasonable assertions about [qualified][30] objects which [do not actually exist][31]. For example, a child might truthfully tell their parent "I ate every vegetable on my plate", when there were no vegetables on the child's plate to begin with. In this case, the parent can believe that the child has actually eaten some vegetables, even though that is not true. In addition, a vacuous truth is often used colloquially with absurd statements, either to confidently assert something (e.g. "the dog was red, or I'm a monkey's uncle" to strongly claim that the dog was red), or to express doubt, sarcasm, disbelief, incredulity or indignation (e.g. "yes, and I'm the Queen of England" to disagree a previously made statement).

## Scope of the concept\[[edit][32]\]

A statement ![S](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2) is "vacuously true" if it [resembles][33] a [material conditional][34] statement ![P\Rightarrow Q](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/27a57c9bc077d0b20e4f5ec006f5342cfbb18fd2), where the [antecedent][35] ![P](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is known to be false.[\[1\]][36][\[3\]][37][\[2\]][38]

Vacuously true statements that can be reduced ([with suitable transformations][39]) to this basic form (material conditional) include the following [universally quantified][40] statements:

Vacuous truths most commonly appear in [classical logic][41] with [two truth values][42]. However, vacuous truths can also appear in, for example, [intuitionistic logic][43], in the same situations as given above. Indeed, if ![P](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is false, then ![P\Rightarrow Q](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/27a57c9bc077d0b20e4f5ec006f5342cfbb18fd2) will yield a vacuous truth in any logic that uses the [material conditional][44]; if ![P](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a) is a [necessary falsehood][45], then it will also yield a vacuous truth under the [strict conditional][46].

Other non-classical logics, such as [relevance logic][47], may attempt to avoid vacuous truths by using alternative conditionals (such as the case of the [counterfactual conditional][48]).

## In computer programming\[[edit][49]\]

In [JavaScript][50], the [array][51] method `every` executes a provided callback function once for each element present in the array, only stopping (if and when) it finds an element where the callback function returns false. Notably, calling the `every` method on an empty array will return true for any condition.[\[6\]][52]

## Examples\[[edit][53]\]

These examples, one from [mathematics][54] and one from [natural language][55], illustrate the concept of vacuous truths:

-   "For any integer x, if x > 5 then x > 3."[\[7\]][56] – This statement is [true][57] non-vacuously (since some [integers][58] are indeed greater than 5), but some of its implications are only vacuously true: for example, when x is the integer 2, the statement implies the vacuous truth that "if 2 > 5 then 2 > 3".
-   "All my children are goats" is a vacuous truth, when spoken by someone without children. Similarly, "None of my children is a goat" would also be a vacuous truth, when spoken by the same person.
