# Top

- top is a binary `1111₂` or unary `11₂` connective corresponding to the "always true" Boolean function.
- top, aka tautology (verum), denoted by `⟙`
- top is a constant function, ignores both inputs
- top, like bottom, scales beautifully: it just returns 1 no matter the arity
- top is symmetric
- top is P-symmetric: whether P = 1100 or P = 0011, ⟙(P) = 1111
- top is rarely used as an operator
- top is almost exclusively used to denote a tautological formula
- top can be defined as `⟙ := P ⋁ ¬P` (always true)
