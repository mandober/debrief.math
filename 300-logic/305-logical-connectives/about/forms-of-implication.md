# Forms of implication

Implication
- material implication
- strict implication, logical entailment, logical implication
- counterfactual implication, subjunctive implication
- inference line


**Material implication** is a truth-functional relation between propositions, fully specified by the truth table.

In contrast to material implication, **strict implication** is not truth-functional - it requires asking about truth-values that propositions have at all the possible worlds, thereby inviting philosophical controversy making strict implication a lot less transparent from of implication. However, when logicians want to express an implication relation that is stronger than material implication, it is what they reach for.

The notion of strict implication is an important concept in modern logic, although often called by different names, such as *logical entailment* or *logical implication*. A claim that a proposition `φ` entails another proposition `ψ` (most often) means that `φ` strictly implies `ψ`.

The standard notation sign for material implication is the arrow `φ -> ψ`, while logical entailment uses the turnstyle sign, `φ |- ψ`, or less frequently, the fat-arrow symbol, `φ => ψ` (sometimes used to make nested entailments more readable). In fact, between these two forms of implication, entailment is on a higher syntactical level since it can contain a formula that expresses material implication, e.g. `|- φ -> ψ`.

The **inference line** of inference rules is a related form of implication. Inference rules of a particular logic system are often given decomposed into two sets of formulas separated by a horizontal line, the line of inference. If the set of formulas written above the line holds, then, usually a single, formula below the line can be inferred.

**Counterfactual (subjunctive) implication** is another implication relation, but it's even less clear-cut and more controversial than strict implication.

It should also be said that there is nowadays a lot of formal, logical work that is devoted to various forms of implication, like strict implication. Part of this is done within so-called "modal" logic; part of it is done in theories of conditionals generally; some of it concerns non-classical logics like relevant logic.
