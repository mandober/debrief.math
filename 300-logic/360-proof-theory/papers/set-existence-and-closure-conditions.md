## Abstract

It is a striking fact from *reverse mathematics* that almost all theorems of countable and countably representable mathematics are equivalent to just 5 subsystems of second order arithmetic. The standard view is that the significance of these equivalences lies in the set existence principles that are necessary and sufficient to prove those theorems. In this article I analyse the role of *set existence principles* in reverse mathematics, and argue that they are best understood as *closure conditions on the powerset of the natural numbers*.

## Introduction

>What axioms are truly necessary for proving particular mathematical theorems?

To answer this question, Harvey Friedman initiated a research program called *reverse mathematics*. By formalising ordinary mathematical concepts in the language of *second order arithmetic*, Friedman was able to show not only that many theorems of ordinary mathematics could be proved in relatively weak subsystems of second order arithmetic, but that such theorems often turned out to be equivalent to the axioms used to prove them, with this equivalence being provable in a weak base theory.
