# Syllogism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism

A **syllogism** is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true.

The word "syllogism" comes from Greek `συλλογισμός` (syllogismos), meaning conclusion, inference.

Syllogistic logic was first established by Aristotle in his book "Prior Analytics" from 350 BCE. In this form, a syllogism arises when two true premises validly imply a conclusion.

For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form:

All men are mortal.  
Socrates is a man.  
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

In antiquity, two rival syllogistic theories existed: *Aristotelian syllogism* and *Stoic syllogism*.

From the Middle Ages onwards, categorical syllogism and syllogism were usually used interchangeably. This article is concerned only with this historical use. The syllogism was at the core of historical deductive reasoning, whereby facts are determined by combining existing statements, in contrast to inductive reasoning in which facts are determined by repeated observations.

Within an academic context, the syllogism was superseded by first-order predicate logic following *Gottlob Frege's 1879's Begriffsschrift*. However, syllogisms remain useful in some circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic.
