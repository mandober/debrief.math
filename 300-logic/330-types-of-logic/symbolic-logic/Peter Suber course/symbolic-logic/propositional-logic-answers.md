**Answers to Copi's Translation and Derivation Exercises**

***Propositional Logic***

> Remember that there are many ways to prove a valid argument valid with a derivation. If my way differs from your way, yours may still be perfectly good.

> If the steps of a proof are too long for their box and wrap to a second line, then the justifications to their right may become out of step with the lines they justify. To fix this, widen your browser window with your mouse.

**Propositional Logic Derivations at p. 45**

Copi assigns these exercises before he introduces CP and IP, and again after he introduces them. I do them here without CP and IP to show that it can be done. Almost all these problems are considerably easier with CP and/or IP.

There must be an easier way!

Part III, exercise 27 (p. 45)

This is a very short proof with CP. See how much labor CP saves us!

Part III, exercise 28 (p. 45)

This is a very short proof with CP.

The argument is also valid if step 3 is translated, "(T  R) · ~E," but I won't provide the proof here.

Part IV, exercise 17 (p. 47)

The argument is also valid if step 1 is translated, "(T  I) · O," but I won't provide the proof here.
