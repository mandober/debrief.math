# Classical logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic

**Classical logic** (*term logic*, *standard logic*) is 
a widely used class of formal logic systems 
that 

an intensively studied and widely used class of formal logic systems.


Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties.

Principles
1. Law of excluded middle
  - Double negative
  - Reductio ad absurdum
2. Law of noncontradiction
  - The principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet)
3. Monotonicity of entailment (weakening)
4. Idempotency of entailment (contraction)
4. Commutativity of conjunction
5. De Morgan duality: every logical operator is dual to another
6. Principle of bivalence (either true orfalse, not both, not neither)
7. The law of identity


## Characteristics

Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties:
* Law of excluded middle and double negation elimination
* Law of noncontradiction, and the principle of explosion
* Monotonicity of entailment and idempotency of entailment
* Commutativity of conjunction
* De Morgan duality: every logical operator has a dual

Most semantics of classical logic are bivalent, meaning all of the possible denotations of propositions can be categorised as either true or false.

The study of classical logics has mostly been focused on propositional and first-order logic.


## History

Classical logic is a 19th and 20th century innovation; this term doesn't refer to classical antiquity - those logic systems are known as *Aristotelian logic*. In fact, even though they have seemed irreconcilable, classical logic is the reconciliation of Aristotle's logic, which ruled for almost 2000 years, with the propositional Stoic logic.

*Leibniz's calculus ratiocinator* can be seen as foreshadowing classical logic. Bernard Bolzano has the understanding of *existential import* found in classical logic but not in Aristotle's. Though he never questioned Aristotle, George Boole's algebraic reformulation of logic as *Boolean logic* was a predecessor of modern mathematical logic and classical logic. William Stanley Jevons and John Venn, who also had the modern understanding of existential import, expanded the Boole's system.

The original, first-order, classical logic is found in *Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift*, which had a wider application than Aristotle's logic and could in fact express it as a special case. Frege explained the *quantifiers* in terms of functions, and his system was the first one capable of dealing with the problem of multiple generality (for which Aristotle's offered no solution). Frege, now considered the founder of analytic philosophy, invented his system as a vehicle to show that all of mathematics was derivable from logic (the doctrine known as *logicism*), and to make arithmetic as rigorous as David Hilbert had made geometry. The notation that Frege used didn't caught on because it was a highly complex two-dimensional presentation, but the essence of Frege's logic is found in modern logics.

The writings of Augustus De Morgan and Charles Sanders Peirce also pioneered classical logic with the *logic of relations*. Peirce influenced Giuseppe Peano and Ernst Schröder.

Classical logic reached fruition in Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead's "Principia Mathematica", and Ludwig Wittgenstein's "Tractatus Logico Philosophicus". Russell and Whitehead were influenced by Peano and Frege, working under logicism (to show that the enterity of mathematics was derivable from logic alone). Wittgenstein was influenced by Frege and Russell, and initially considered the Tractatus to have solved all problems of philosophy.

Willard Van Orman Quine insisted on classical, *first-order logic* as the true logic, saying higher-order logic was "set theory in disguise".

Jan Łukasiewicz pioneered *non-classical logic*. The results of Kurt Goedel and Alfred Tarski undermined the logicist doctrine.

## Generalized semantics

With the advent of *algebraic logic* it became apparent that *classical propositional calculus* admits other semantics.

In *Boolean-valued semantics* (for classical propositional logic), the truth values are the elements of an arbitrary Boolean algebra; "true" corresponds to the maximal element of the algebra, "false" to the minimal element. Intermediate elements of the algebra correspond to truth values other than "true" and "false". *The principle of bivalence* holds only when the Boolean algebra is taken to be the two-element algebra, with no intermediate elements.
