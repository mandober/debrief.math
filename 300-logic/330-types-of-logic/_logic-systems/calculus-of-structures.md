# Calculus of structures

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_structures

The calculus of structures is a proof calculus with deep inference for studying the structural proof theory of noncommutative logic. The calculus has since been applied to study linear logic, classical logic, modal logic, and process calculi, and many benefits are claimed to follow in these investigations from the way in which deep inference is made available in the calculus.
