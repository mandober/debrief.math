# Possible world

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world

A possible world is a complete and consistent way the world is or could have been.

Possible worlds are widely used as a formal device in logic, philosophy, and linguistics in order to provide a semantics for intensional and modal logic.

Their metaphysical status has been a subject of controversy in philosophy, with modal realists such as David Lewis arguing that they are literally existing alternate realities, and others such as Robert Stalnaker arguing that they are not.
