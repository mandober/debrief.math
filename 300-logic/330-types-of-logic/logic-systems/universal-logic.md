# Universal logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_logic

**Universal logic** is the field of logic that studies the features common to all logical systems, aiming to be to logic what universal algebra is to algebra.

A number of approaches to universal logic have been proposed since the XX century, using model theoretic and categorical approaches.

## Development

The roots of universal logic may go as far back as some work of Alfred Tarski in the early XX century, but the modern notion was first presented in the 1990s by Swiss logician **Jean-Yves Béziau**. In the context defined by Béziau, 3 main approaches to universal logic have been explored in depth:

- an abstract model theory system axiomatized by Jon Barwise.
- a topological/categorical approach based on sketches (sometimes called categorical model theory).
- a categorical approach originating in Computer Science based on Goguen and Burstall's notion of institution.

While logic has been studied for centuries, Mossakowski et al. commented in 2007 that "it is embarrassing that there is no widely acceptable formal definition of logic".

These approaches to universal logic thus aim to address and formalize the nature of what may be called logic as a form of "sound reasoning".

## Congresses and publications

Since 2005, Béziau has been organizing world congresses and schools on universal logic. These events bring together hundreds of researchers and students in the field and offer tutorials and research talks on a wide range of subjects.

There is also a journal "Logica Universalis" with Béziau as editor-in-chief, established in 2007. Springer also started to publish a book series "Studies in Universal Logic" with Béziau as the series editor. An anthology titled "Universal Logic" was published in 2012, giving a new light on the subject.
