**Logical Systems  
Course-Related Links**

[Peter Suber][1], [Philosophy Department][2], [Earlham College][3]

Since 1996 I've made link pages like this one for each of my courses. In the meantime, the size of the web and the power of search engines have both leaped forward. The growth of the web has made representative or comprehensive link pages more difficult to produce, and the improvement of search engines has made them less necessary. Link pages can still be very useful, but to make them more useful than the best search engines takes more work than they are usually worth. So I won't be updating this link page (from the previous iteration of the course) but I leave it online in case it has any remaining utility. When I know of specific web pages helpful for a class discussion, then I'll mail out the URLs to the [class email list][4] during the semester (and I encourage you to do the same). For general online research on the many topics of the course, I recommend [Google][5]. —Peter.
