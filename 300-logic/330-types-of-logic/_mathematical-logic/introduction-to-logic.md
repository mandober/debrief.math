# Introduction to logic

(`An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof`, Peter B. Andrews, 1986)

The ability to reason is one of the marvels of human nature. 

In many situations it is not easy to think logically, but the benefits of doing so are a familiar fact of human experience. 

Since at least the time of Aristotle (384-322 BCE), many questions have been raised by inquisitive and reflective minds about the nature of reasoning, and about ways of improving our use of reason. 

From such questions and attempts to answer them has arisen the intellectual discipline known as logic.

Let us put the study of logic into perspective. 

Humans are born with hands, but the development of tools has vastly expanded what humans can do. Humans are born with eyes, but the study of optics and other relevant disciplines has made it possible to develop sophisticated telescopes and microscopes which vastly expand what we can see, leading to amazing advances in fields such as astronomy and biology. 

We are endowed with the ability to reason, and the study of logic can serve the following purposes:
1. enhance our ability to reason correctly, deeply, with well founded confidence
2. prepare us to use, and perhaps help develop, the automated reasoning tools which are being developed and which will have revolutionary impact on many intellectual activities
3. prepare us to study the many deep and fascinating questions in mathematics, philosophy, and computer science which have their roots in logic.

Note that as the development of automated reasoning tools makes it increasingly practical to use very rigorous reasoning in various disciplines, there will be increasing demand that such standards of rigor be adhered to. 

For example, the day will come when computer hardware and software which has simply been tested on many cases will be regarded as unacceptably unreliable. Only hardware and software which has been proved to meet its specifications will be regarded as acceptable.

Intellectual disciplines, such as scientific or philosophical theories, usually evolve over many years, often many centuries. Starting with isolated statements expressing various facts, they gradually become more organized and systematic as people struggle to find order in the phenomena under consideration. 

Gradually, general principles emerge which enable one to understand many particular facts as manifestations of these general principles. If the process progresses sufficiently far, one may obtain a systematic presentation of these general principles in which all of them can be derived from a few very basic and well specified principles called *the postulates of the theory* that has developed. If one goes a little farther, one specifies not only the postulates, but also the exact language in which the theory is to be expressed and the rules of logical reasoning which are to be used. 

One thus obtains what logicians call a *formal theory* or *logistic system*. 

It can be seen that formalization of a theory is the ultimate act of systematization in a long chain of developments. It removes some of the last potential sources of confusion and vagueness. When one formalizes a theory, one may clarify what assumptions are tacitly made by those who habitually use the theory. (The Axiom of Choice is a striking example of an assumption which was used tacitly in mathematics for a number of years before it was explicitly recognized.)

The development of automated reasoning tools makes it likely that formalization of theories will eventually be regarded as a practical necessity, since such formalization will facilitate the development of comprehensive and sophisticated information systems which incorporate scientific and technical theories, and which can derive relevant consequences of these theories. 

The ability to derive logical consequences from fundamental principles provides an enormously economical way of storing information. Indeed, it permits one to obtain information which was never explicitly put into the system, and obtain it in a variety of forms.

Of course, attempts to understand the nature of reasoning and to build sophisticated information systems which can draw logical conclusions may be regarded as part of an endeavor to fashion more powerful intellectual tools for coping with the increasingly complex problems which confront mankind.

It is sometimes felt that in order to make certain disciplines (such as social sciences) more scientific, one should make them more "mathematical".

To the unsophisticated observer of mathematics, it may appear that the use of numbers is the critical characteristic of disciplines which use mathematics, and that one can thus make a discipline more scientific by involving numbers in it more deeply. However, the really fundamental feature of mathematics is not numbers but *logical rigor*. While arguments involving numbers are often rigorous, it will be seen that a standard of rigor can be defined and maintained whether numbers are involved or not.

Our study of logic will be concerned with only certain aspects of the reasoning process. Our focus will not be on the psychology or physiology of human reasoning, but on *reasoning as an abstract process* which can be used to derive new information from known information.

A striking feature of the reasoning process is the "magic leap" which a reasoner makes from what is known to conclusions which "follow logically" from what is known. As we shall see, this magic leap can be analyzed and studied in a mathematically precise way.

How can something as abstract and apparently nebulous as thoughts be analyzed with mathematical precision? It turns out that there is a correspondence between our thoughts and the words we use to express them, and between our logical processes and manipulations of strings of words.

Thus, we can analyze logical inferences in terms of operations on *symbolic expressions*, and these can be defined precisely and treated as objects of mathematical study.

Indeed, it has been found that valid arguments can be justified by showing that they have correct logical forms, even if one does not understand the meanings of many of the words in the arguments. 

It is important to learn to focus on the form rather than the content of an argument when one is analyzing its correctness, because in complicated situations one can easily be led into error by relying on one's intuition about what is true instead of using careful logical deduction.
