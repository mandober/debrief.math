# Axiom

An axiom is a statement, a well-established truth that is so evident that its acceptence is expected to pass without raising questions or controversy.

At least so it was in the early stages of mathematical development. At that time, mathematics has inherited the notion of axiom from philosophy, and with it came this presuposition that some things are so obviously true (to everyone, everwhere, and at all times) that their truth value, being so evidently true, requires no further justification.

This stands in opposition to mathematical rigor that demands a high level of precision in mathematical expositions, naturally leading to the requirement that no terms are mentioned without previously being defined. But how can we ensure that all terms are defined?

When creating a mathematical theory, an author usually starts by describing the object that is fundamental to the theory. Even if he can come up with a satisfying definition (that is general and specific enough, and catches all the egde-case) for the concept that is central to his theory, that definition must be stated using words that include some other terms - the terms which require a definition as well. More definitions entail more definitions. There is no end to this process known as the *infinite regression* (or downward spiral in NIN terminology). Hence the need for axioms - as the terms, in the infinite sequence of terms, at which we cut the spiral down. Of course, the spiral is not cut willy-nilly, but always at (near) the term that is of the most importance regarding a certain theory. After locating such a term (or terms) the author is relieved of having to define it. He is free to introduce it as an axiom. Another option is to introduce it as a primitive mathematical object.

Mathematical primitives and axioms are practically the same, only axioms usually take the form of formulas, while primitives remain in the vague form as seemingly more univeral qualities. Some common primitives include a set, the empty set, point, space, number.







* This is similar to a programming language, in which a name cannot be referenced without it being previously defined (otherwise, an error about the use of an undefined name is issued).

* Axioms and primitives require no definition.
* Axioms stands in opposition to definitions, which are defined terms.


* An axiom is a statement, expected to be taken as true without a question, that serves as a starting point for further reasoning.
* An axiom is a premise for further argumentation.
* An axiom (postulate, assumption) is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise (starting point) for further argumentation (reasoning).
* Individual axioms are almost always part of a larger axiomatic system.

## Word origin

The term "axiom" comes from the ancient Greek's word `ἀξίωμα` [axíōma] meaning "dignity", "weight", "value"; "that which is thought worthy or fit", "that which commends itself as evident".


* A statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. From ancient Greek `axiōma` "what is thought fitting", from `axios` "worthy" -- Oxford American College Dictionary
 
* A proposition that commends itself to general acceptance; a well-established or universally conceded principle; a maxim, rule, law.

* Axiom is a presupposition, or foundational proposition, in science, especially in deductive theory.



## Def

The term "axiom" exhibits subtle differences across different fields.
* In philosophy, an axiom is understood as a statement that is so obviously true and well-established that it's to be accepted without question or controversy.
* In logic, an axiom is a premise, a starting point of reasoning.
* In mathematics, the term "axiom" has two related but distinct conotations, thus forming two groups called logical axioms and non-logical axioms.

Logical axioms are statements pertaining to logic, thus, they are universal and used in the same form across different theories. This is contrasted with non-logical axioms that are very specific to a particular theory.

Logical axioms are taken to be true within the system of logic they define, and they often have symbolic form, e.g. `a ∧ b → a`.

Non-logical axioms are substantive assertions about the domain of a specific theory, e.g. arithmetic, with the axiom of commutativity, `a + b = b + a`.


When used in the latter sense, "axiom", "postulate", and "assumption" may be used interchangeably. In most cases, a non-logical axiom is simply a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory, and might or might not be self-evident in nature (e.g., parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry). To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms), and there may be multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.

Any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be "true" is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics.
