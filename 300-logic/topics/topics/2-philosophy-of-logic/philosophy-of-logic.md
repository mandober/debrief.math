# Philosophy of logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_logic

**Philosophy of logic** is the area of philosophy that studies the scope and nature of logic. It investigates the philosophical problems raised by logic, such as the presuppositions often implicitly at work in theories of logic and in their application.

This involves questions about how logic is to be defined and how different logical systems are connected to each other. It includes the study of the nature of the fundamental concepts used by logic and the relation of logic to other disciplines. 

According to a common characterization, *philosophical logic* is the part of the philosophy of logic that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems, often in the form of extended logical systems like modal logic. But other theorists draw the distinction between the philosophy of logic and philosophical logic differently or not at all. 

*Metalogic* is closely related to the philosophy of logic as the discipline investigating the properties of formal logical systems, like consistency and completeness.
