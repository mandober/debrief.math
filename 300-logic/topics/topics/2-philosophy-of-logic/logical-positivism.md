# Logical positivism

**Logical positivism**, later called **logical empiricism**, and both of which together are also known as **neopositivism**, is a philosophical movement in analytic philosophy and a *theory of knowledge*, whose central thesis was the *verification principle*, aka the *verifiability criterion of meaning*.

This theory of knowledge asserted that only statements verifiable through direct observation or logical proof are meaningful in terms of conveying truth value, information or factual content.

They used the verification principle to try and rule out all metaphysical discussion about reality, all religious talk about God, and all ethical talk about the good and the right. However, they soon realized that much more would end up being ruled out as a result.

GÃ¶del was a frequent visitor to a group of thinkers who gathered in Vienna to discuss philosophy. This group, known as *the Vienna circle*, consisted of Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Karnap, Otto Neurath (physicalism), and many others. They were inspired by the rapid advancements in science and logic and initiated a movement called logical positivism.

>The positivist view was that a statement about the world could be meaningful iff it is either empirically verifiable or it can be shown to be true through logical analysis of its symbols.

Flourishing in several European centres through the 1930s, the movement sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims by converting philosophy into "scientific philosophy", which, according to the logical positivists, ought to share the bases and structures of empirical sciences' best examples.

After World War II, the movement shifted to a milder variant, *logical empiricism*, led mainly by Carl Hempel. In the ensuing years, the movement's central premises, still unresolved, were heavily criticised by leading philosophers, particularly Willard van Orman Quine and Karl Popper, and even, within the movement itself, by Hempel. The 1962 publication of Thomas Kuhn's landmark book "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" dramatically shifted academic philosophy's focus. In 1967 philosopher John Passmore pronounced logical positivism to be dead as disco.

**Verificationism**, also known as the verification principle or the verifiability criterion of meaning, which asserts that a statement is meaningful only if it is either empirically verifiable (i.e. confirmed through the senses) or a truth of logic (e.g. tautologies). Verificationism rejects statements of metaphysics, theology, ethics, and aesthetics, as "cognitively meaningless". Such statements may be meaningful in influencing emotions or behavior, but not in terms of conveying truth value, information, or factual content. Verificationism was a central theme of logical positivism, a movement in *analytic philosophy* that emerged in the 1920s by philosophers who sought to unify philosophy and science under a common naturalistic theory of knowledge.


Logical positivists argued that most metaphysical discourse is just meaningless. They had a criterion for the meaningfulness for statements, called the verification principle which stated that a statement is cognitively meaningful (in the sense of being true or false) iff it's verifiable. They claimed that most metaphysical discourse was unverifiable and thus nonsense; that the meaningful parts of metaphysical discourse were only definitionally true.

Logical positivism rejected as illegitimate every statement about the world that was not based on direct experience. Understanding the meaning of a proposition now required that you know how to verify it.

A sentence is only meaningful when we can verify it by experience. When a sentence cannot be verified a posteriori, then it is *meaningless*, which meant that it literally has no meaning at all; it doesn't even get to be false. "Like when a cat purrs - it's not right or wrong - it's just noise"; this was tought of metaphysics.

## The problem with verification

Logical positivism had a tremendous impact on XX century philosophy, so for many years metaphysics was off the table as a topic of serious philosophical discourse.

However, when its premises were followed all the way to their logical conclusions, cracks began to appear in the edifice of their principle of verification. If logical positivists rigorously applied verificationist criteria for meaningfulness to physics, for example, they came up against enormous problems. 

*The problems of unobservables*.

In trying to throw out metaphysics, they ended up repeatedly finding themselves throwing out all of science too, which they didn't want. They were never able to come up with a formulation of the verification principle that could distinguish between a priori sciences (metaphysics and the other "bad" discourses) they wanted to get rid of, and a posteriori sciences they wanted to keep.
