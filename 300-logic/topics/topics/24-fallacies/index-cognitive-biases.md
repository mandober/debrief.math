Query languages, data query languages or database query languages (DQLs) are computer languages used to make queries in databases and information systems.

A well known example is the Structured Query Language (SQL).

- Data definition language (DDL)

- Data manipulation language (DML)

- Data query language (DQL), Database query languages

- Data control language (DCM)

* Structured Query Language (SQL)
  As per Microsoft SQL server there are four groups of SQL Commands (MSSQL)
  - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - Data Control Language (DCL)
  - Transaction Control Language (TCL)


## Types

Broadly, query languages can be classified according to whether they are database query languages or information retrieval query languages.
* *database query language* 
  attempts to give factual answers to factual questions.
* *information retrieval query language* 
  attempts to find documents containing information 
  that is relevant to an area of inquiry.
