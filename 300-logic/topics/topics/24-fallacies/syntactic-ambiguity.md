**Syntactic ambiguity**, also called *structural ambiguity*, *amphiboly* or *amphibology*, is a situation where a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due its ambiguous structure.

Example: "She sees more of her children than her husband".

Syntactic ambiguity arises not from the range of meanings of single words, but from the relationship between the words and clauses of a sentence, and the sentence structure underlying the word order therein. In other words, a sentence is syntactically ambiguous when a reader or listener can reasonably interpret one sentence as having more than one possible structure.

In legal disputes, courts may be asked to interpret the meaning of syntactic ambiguities in statutes or contracts. In some instances, arguments asserting highly unlikely interpretations have been deemed frivolous.

A set of possible parse trees for an ambiguous sentence is called a *parse forest*.

The process of resolving syntactic ambiguity is called *syntactic disambiguation*.

## Forms of ambiguity

The ambiguity is question arises in two different forms, as global and local.

### Locally ambiguous

A *locally ambiguous sentence* is a sentence that contains an ambiguous phrase which is eventually resolved, so such sentences have only one interpretation.

The ambiguity in a locally ambiguous sentence persists for a moment but gets disambiguated by the end of the sentence. Sometimes, local ambiguities can result in *garden path sentences*², in which an overall, structurally sound, sentence is difficult to interpret because one interpretation of the ambiguous region is not the ultimate coherent interpretation.

  ² Note: A garden-path sentence is a grammatically correct sentence that starts in such a way that a reader's most likely interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a parse that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning. "Garden path" refers to the saying "to be led down the garden path", meaning to be deceived, tricked, or seduced.

Examples:
- "The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families."
- "The old man the boat."


The examples of initial ambiguity may result from a reduced relative clause with potentially intransitive verb, e.g. "The horse raced in the barn fell"; these can be contrasted with the lack of ambiguity when the clause is not reduced, e.g. "The horse that was raced in the barn fell".

A *reduced relative clause* is a relative clause that is not marked by an explicit relative pronoun or complementizer such as *who*, *which* or *that*.

### Globally ambiguous

A *globally ambiguous sentence* is a sentence that has at least two distinct interpretations. In this type the ambiguity persists even after the entire sentence is comprehended.

Re-interpreting (rereading) the sentence cannot resolve the ambiguity because no feature of the representation (such as word order) distinguishes the distinct interpretations.

Global ambiguities are often unnoticed because the reader tends to choose one of the meanings automatically, perhaps the one that is more easily understoond or is just more probable. Example: "She sees more of her children than her husband".
