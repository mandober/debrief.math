# Fallacy of four terms

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_four_terms

**The fallacy of four terms** (in Latin *quaternio terminorum*) is the formal fallacy that occurs when a syllogism has four (or more) terms rather than the requisite three, rendering it invalid.

## Definition

Categorical syllogisms always have 3 terms:
- (Major premise)   All fish have fins.
- (Minor premise)   All goldfish are fish.
- (Conclusion)      All goldfish have fins.

Here, the 3 terms are "goldfish", "fish" and "fins".

Using four terms invalidates the syllogism:
- (Major premise)   All fish have fins.
- (Minor premise)   All goldfish are fish.
- (Conclusion)      All humans have fins.

The premises don't connect all term: "humans" are not asociated with "fins", so the reasoning is invalid.

Notice that there are 4 terms: "fish", "fins", "goldfish" and "humans". Two premises are not enough to connect four different terms, since in order to establish connection, there must be one term common to both premises.

*Equivocation* is the use of the same phrase, but each time with a different meaning. In everyday reasoning, the fallacy of four terms occurs most frequently by equivocation, creating a fourth term even though only 3 distinct words are used:
- (Major premise) Nothing is better than eternal happiness.
- (Minor premise) A ham sandwich is better than nothing.
- (Conclusion)    A ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness.

The word "nothing" in the example above has two meanings, as presented: "nothing is better" means the thing being named has the highest value possible; "better than nothing" only means that the thing being described has some value. Therefore, "nothing" acts as two different terms in this example, thus creating the fallacy of four terms.

The fallacy of four terms also applies to syllogisms that contain 5 or 6 terms.

## Reducing terms

Sometimes a syllogism that is apparently fallacious because it is stated with more than 3 terms can be translated into an equivalent, valid 3 term syllogism.

For example:

Major premise: No humans are immortal.
Minor premise: All Greeks are people.
Conclusion: All Greeks are mortal.
This EAE-1 syllogism apparently has five terms: "humans", "people", "immortal", "mortal", and "Greeks". However it can be rewritten as a standard form AAA-1 syllogism by first substituting the synonymous term "humans" for "people" and then by reducing the complementary term "immortal" in the first premise using the immediate inference known as obversion (that is, "No humans are immortal." is equivalent to "All humans are mortal.").

## Classification

The fallacy of four terms is a syllogistic fallacy. Types of syllogism to which it applies include statistical syllogism, hypothetical syllogism, and categorical syllogism, all of which must have exactly three terms. Because it applies to the argument's form, as opposed to the argument's content, it is classified as a formal fallacy.

Equivocation of the middle term is a frequently cited source of a fourth term being added to a syllogism; both of the equivocation examples above affect the middle term of the syllogism. Consequently this common error itself has been given its own name: the fallacy of the ambiguous middle.

An argument that commits the ambiguous middle fallacy blurs the line between formal and informal (material) fallacies, however it is usually considered an informal fallacy because the argument's form appears valid.
