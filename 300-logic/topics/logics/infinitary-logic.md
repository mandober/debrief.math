# Infinitary logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_logic

An infinitary logic is a logic that allows infinitely long statements or proofs.

Some infinitary logics may have different properties from those of standard first-order logic. In particular, infinitary logics may fail to be compact or complete. Notions of *compactness* and *completeness* that are equivalent in finitary logic may not be in infinitary logics. Therefore, for infinitary logics, notions of *strong compactness* and *strong completeness* are defined.

This article addresses *Hilbert-type infinitary logics*, as these have been extensively studied and constitute the most straightforward extensions of finitary logic. These are not, however, the only infinitary logics that have been formulated or studied.

Considering whether Ω-logic (also an infinitary logic) is complete promises to throw light on the continuum hypothesis.
