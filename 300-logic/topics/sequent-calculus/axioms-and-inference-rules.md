# Axioms and inference rules in a logic system

In general, logic studies valid forms of inference (such as the modus ponens). Every system (style) of formal logical argumentation admits a particular set of inference rules according to which the derivations proceed.

Besides cosmetic differences pertaining to the way their organize derivations, these systems are distinguished by the particular set of inference rules they admit. Sometimes a set of admitted axioms is also mentioned, but this shouldn't create the impression that axioms and inference rules are separate entities, when in fact, axioms are also rules of inference that lack premises.

>Axioms are rules of inference without premises.

Some authors will cite the set of inference rules together with the axioms, while others will make a point in separating the two. The latter is especially the practice when describing a Hilbert-style system of deduction, since such systems have far more axioms that "regular" rule of inference.
