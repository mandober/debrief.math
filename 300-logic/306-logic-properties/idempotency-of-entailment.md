# Idempotency of entailment

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotency_of_entailment

**Idempotency of entailment** is a property of logical systems that states that one may derive the same consequences from many instances of a hypothesis as from just one.

This property can be captured by a structural rule called contraction, and in such systems one may say that entailment is idempotent if and only if contraction is an admissible rule.
