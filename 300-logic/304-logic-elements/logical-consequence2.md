# Logical consequence

https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/logical-consequence/

A good argument is one whose conclusions follow from its premises; its conclusions are consequences of its premises.

- But in what sense do conclusions follow from premises?
- What is it for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?

Those questions, in many respects, are at the heart of logic, especially logic as a philosophical discipline.

Consider the following argument:
- If we charge high fees for university, only the rich will enroll.
- We charge high fees for university.
- Therefore, only the rich will enroll.

There are many different things one can say about this argument, but many agree that if we don't equivocate[^ยน] (if the terms mean the same thing in the premises and the conclusion) then the argument is valid, i.e., the conclusion follows deductively from the premises. This doesn't mean the conclusion is true; perhaps the premises are not true. However, if the premises are true (or, assuming the premises are true), then the conclusion is necessarily also true, as a matter of logic.

We investigate the relation between the premises and the conclusion of valid arguments. Contemporary analyses of the concept of consequence (of the 'follows from' relation) take it to be both *necessary* and *formal*, and the presentation is often augmented with proofs and/or models. Here, we try to provide a brief characterisation of some of the notions that play a central role in contemporary accounts of logical consequence.

1. Deductive and Inductive Consequence
2. Formal and Material Consequence
3. Proofs and Models
4. Premises and Conclusions
5. One or Many

[^ยน]: equivocation is the use of ambiguous language so as to conceal the truth or to avoid perjuring yourself.
