# Non-logical axioms

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-logical_axioms

**Non-logical axioms** are assumptions that are specific to a theory.

Reasoning about different structures (e.g. ℕ and ℤ) may invoke the same logical axioms; however, non-logical axioms aim to capture the particularities of the structure. Thus, non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not tautologies. Another name for a non-logical axiom is **postulate**.

Almost every mathematical theory starts with a set of non-logical axioms; it was thought that, in principle, every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas.

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as "axioms" in mathematical discourse (but that doesn't mean they are true in some absolute sense).

For example, in some groups, the group operation is commutative, and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom, we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

>Axioms are elementary basis for a logic system and together with inference rules define a deductive system.
