# Logic

- debrief: math
- section: logic
- section-name: mathematical logic
- meta-path:`math/300-logic`

## Rationale

As a math discipline, Mathematical Logic, should be introduced at the earliest occasion since it is needed for any other topic. On the other hand, it's not needed in its entirety (e.g. to go over the set theory), but one the previous hand, it is strictly forbidden to split the section. Perhaps, a "logic primer" of sorts, as a page in the set theory

This section is huge, but for the moment it is divided into:
* *Mathematical Logic*
  - the entry level to math logic
  - particularly the stuff required for e.g. Set Theory, in fact, for all the sections preceding it (which are still very set-theoretical)
  - so the math-logic subbroup/subsection contains entry level topics, and probably all the other general topics that don't fit in other logic-related sections.
* *Propositional logic*
  - it will be hard to separate the topics fro mthe first and this section...
* *Predicate logic*
  - better

page-groups (subfolders):

* *the rundown* (the squeeze, occasional review, quick reminder, hasty ref)
  - summary, summaries, crucial-points
  - indices, index, enums, enumerations, lists, aggregations-of-lists
    - logical-connectives, one-page desc
    - one-page desc of principles and laws
      - logic-laws, or joined woth principles as:
      - logic-principles
    - rules-of-inference, one-page desc
    - types-of-logics, one-page short desc

* *the treatment* (the works, detailed treatment of topics)
  - overview
    (Topics within as bullit-points. Granularity?)
  - basics, basic-concepts, basic-elements, essentials, elementary
    (Should present basic terms and concepts)

* *classes* (groups, categories, sets, topical-family)
  index (indices, enums, lists, "the registry"), one-page index
- index: classification of logic systems
  - index: types of logic systems
  - index: divisions of logic systems
  - index: orders of logic systems
- index: logical connectives
- index: rules of inference
- index: laws and principles

(ohshit)
