# Introduction

Although the concept of functions existed before, it was formalized in terms of set theory as a particular type of relation between sets.

Any subset of the *Cartesian product* between two non-empty sets defines a relation between them.

A particular relation that associates each element of the *domain* set (DOM) to a single element of *codomain* set (COD) is called a function.

Cartesian product, relation and function are all sets: fn is a proper subsets of all relations which are subset of Cartesian product:

$$f(x)=y \ \subset \ xRy \ \subseteq \ X \times Y$$


All functions are relations, but not all relations are functions. Considering two sets: `functions ⊂ relations ⊆ dot product`.
