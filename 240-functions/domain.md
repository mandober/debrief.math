# Domain

The **domain** is the source set in operations or relations on two sets.

Given two sets `A` and `B`, where `∀a ∈ A` and `∀b ∈ B`, set `A` is the domain:
- in set operations (union, intersection, etc.), e.g. `A U B = {a ∨ b}`
- in the dot product, `A x B = {(a,b)}`
- in relations on sets, `aRb` i.e. `{(a,b)} = R ⊆ A x B`
- in functions, `f :: A -> B` and `f = {(a,b)}`

The domain set is sometimes denoted by $$A_{dom}$$.
