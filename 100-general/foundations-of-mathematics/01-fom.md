# The Foundation of Mathematics

The foundation of mathematics, like the foundation of any other theory, deals with these fundamental questions:
1. What objects are the subject of mathematical study and which of these objects can be considered as the most fundamental ones, as the most basic building blocks?
2. What are the most basic properties of the studied objects? These properties have usually the form of laws, principles or axioms.
3. How are more complex objects build from the elemetary ones, and how are other properties derived from the basic properties?

Unification of knowledge is one of the goals of mathematics and, more generally, of all sciences. An important aspect of such unification is identifying the object that is central and most fundamental to the theory. Some lucky theories have it really easy: for example, the group theory has its central object identified right from the start; and the set theory, number theory and category theory as well. However, when we zoom out and shift our perspective into the teritory of the more general theory, such as that of physics or mathematics, the problem of establishing the central object becomes very tricky.

In physics, the most fundamental object needs to be a model for the most fundamental objects found in nature; however, for thousands of years and still today, we keep failing to find one. The philosophers of the ancient Greece have come up with the name atom for a fundamental object of nature they could have only hypothesize about. It was only in the recent times that the concept of an atom finally found the appropriate objects in nature it wouldn't mind being associated with. However, atom as the elementary particle didn't stand for a long time and relatively quickly the object it was composed of were identified. Today we have a zoo consisting of the 17 elementary particles (6 quarks, 6 leptons, 5 bosons) arranged in *the standard model* that undelines "The Theory of (almost) Everything" (gravity proves elusive still) as we work towards the full coverage.

**The Standard Model** (SM) of particle physics is the theory describing 3 of the 4 fundamental forces in the universe (electromagnetic force, weak and strong interactions, with gravity remaining elusive), as well as classifying all known elementary particles. The SM was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world. The current formulation was finalized in the mid-1970s, after the existence of quarks was experimentally confirmed. Since then, confirmation of the *top quark* (1995), the *tau neutrino* (2000), and the *Higgs boson* (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. To its further credit, the SM has also accurately predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the `W` and `Z` bosons.
