# Mathematical Objects

"Mathematics consists of true facts about imaginary objects." -- P. Davis and R. Hersh.
*"Mathematics consists of true facts about imaginary objects."* -- P. Davis and R. Hersh.

Of course we know that a rectangle is not a physical object like a house and that the number 42 is not a person. Nevertheless:

These facts about how we *talk* about math objects show how we *think* about them. We *talk* about math objects in these ways because we *think* of them as things, although not as *physical* things.

Remember: I am discussing how we *think* and *talk about* mathematical objects, *not what they really are.*

Rowena: "111 is not a prime. It is divisible by 37."

Eudora: "Well my stars, you're right. I never noticed that."

Eudora: "That tree must be ten feet tall".

Rowena: "It can't be that short, it's taller than the two-story house next to it."

We expect that there is always  
an explanation of an apparent contradiction  
in math, even if we cannot find it.

## Kinds and properties

#### Mathematical objects come in different kinds and have various properties.

One __kind__ of mathematical object is "[integer][1]". Another is "[real number][2]". The number 42 is both an integer and a real number. The number π is a real number but not an integer. A kind of object can be named by a noun or a [noun phrase][3].

The number 42 has the __property__ of being even. The number 43 is an integer but not an even integer. Both numbers have the property that they are greater than 40. Thus properties can be named by adjectives ("even") or phrases ("greater than 40").

#### The ideas of kind and property are not really different.

You could define a kind of mathematical object called __ent__ to denote an even integer and another kind __ont__ to denote odd integers. Then you could say "42 is an ent" using the same grammar as when you say "42 is an integer". So although we think of "integer" as a __kind__ of thing and "even" as a __property__ of things, calling even integers ents allows us to think of "even integer" as a *kind*.

Your mental image of "kind" may be that it is a more permanent and intrinsic thing than "property". (Being human is a kind but being red-headed is a property.) This distinction is not important when thinking rigorously about math because in [rigorous mode,][4] math objects are thought of as *inert and unchanging*.

## Constructors

#### Math objects can be constructed from other math objects by many different procedures.

-   The integers 1, 2 and 4 are math objects, and from them you can construct the set {1,2,4}.
-   You can construct the [ordered pair][5] (1,2) from the numbers 1 and 2.
-   From those same numbers you can construct *another* ordered pair (2,1) and a bunch of ordered triples such as (1,2,1).
-   For any given *set* you can construct its __set of subsets__. For example, the set {∅,{1},{2},{1,2}} is the set of subsets of {1,2}.

#### In abstractmath.org, we construct math objects only out of math objects.

In abmath, we don't (usually) talk about the set of pairs of people consisting of husbands and wives. We don't talk about the list of American states ordered alphabetically. This is to avoid certain philosophical complications that would be distracting and largely irrelevant.

Other websites and texts *do* make constructions using math constructors on physical objects. They are not wrong to do this. Here I am merely wimping out on getting into the complexities they involve!

## Objects, processes and relationships

#### A math object is like a physical object in that you can do things to it.

-   You can burn a piece of wood.
-   You can add 77 to itself, getting 154.
-   You can take the derivative of the function x3, getting 3x2.

#### You can't do most operations to *every* object, though.

-   You can burn a piece of wood but you can't burn a molecule of helium.
-   You can add 77 to itself but you can't add a triangle to itself.
-   You can't take the derivative of the function defined by:
    
    F(x)\={1if xis rational0if xis irrational
    
    (more about that function [here][6]).

#### You can perform more complicated operations involving several objects.

-   You can nail a birdhouse to a tree.
-   You can add 42 and 63.
-   You can calculate
    
    ∫353x2dx\=98
    
    which means applying the process of calculating the definite integral to *three objects*: two numbers, 3 and 5, and one [function][7] x↦3x2.

#### Math objects can have various relationships with each other.

-   The Washington Monument is taller than the White House.
-   42 is less than 63.
-   Two triangles may or may not be [congruent][8]__.__ If they are not congruent, they may or may not be [similar][9]

## What IS a mathematical object?

*I am myself and my circumstances.* [José Ortega y Gasset][10].

As I said at the top of this chapter, I am not going to talk about what math objects *are*, but how you should think about them.

#### Example

The number 42 is an object about which you know a bunch of things:

-   It is called "42" in decimal notation and "101010" in binary notation.
-   It is an [integer][11].
-   It is divisible by 2.
-   It is one more than 41.
-   You can add, subtract and multiply it by other numbers.

In other words, you know some of its __properties__, some __processes__ you can apply to it, and some __relationships__ it has with other objects. That is all you ever need to know about a math object. "What it is" is irrelevant.

All you can know about a math object is its properties,  
the processes you can apply to it,  
and its relationships with other math objects.  
There is nothing else to know.

## Abstract objects

### Interactive abstract objects

There are other kinds of __abstract objects__ besides math objects. I will give some examples here. But note: you can get carried away and write *books* about abstract objects and classify them in also sorts of ways. You may think I have got carried away a bit too much here!

-   "__September__" is an abstract object with a [proper name][12]. It certainly is not a physical object. Its properties *change over time* (sometimes "this month is September" is true and sometimes it is false) and *it affects what people do* (some of us have to go back to school). Neither of these is true of mathematical objects (see [rigorous][13]).
-   A __schedule__ is an abstract object. When we think about our schedule for Wednesday afternoon, it *may* be represented as a physical piece of handwriting, or as a bunch of [pits][14] on our hard disk (which if we push the right buttons becomes characters for us to read on a screen), or it may be *only in our mind.* The schedule is an abstract object with possible physical representations, and we refer to it as we refer to physical objects. We say "my schedule" and "I need to make a schedule". A schedule is not a mathematical object: *it affects what people do* and *it changes over time.*

### Fictional objects

I am using the word “object” in the philosophical sense of *object of thought*. Such a thing can be animate or inanimate.

A [unicorn][15] is a __fictional object__. We may talk about them as if they are real physical objects, and we think of them as having many of the properties of physical objects.

A unicorn has a horn in the middle of its forehead, allows only virgins to ride it, and has cloven hooves. If you show a picture of a supposed unicorn that shows horse-type non-split hooves to certain types of fantasy fans, they will object strongly and say, "That's wrong! Unicorns have cloven hooves!"

But what does that __mean__? Why not define unicorns any way you want, since they are not real? Answer: For the same reason we must not define π to be equal to 3: The meaning of the symbol π and the concept of unicorn are *part of our common cultur*e (at least the common culture of the intersection of fantasy fans and mathematicians) and we violate our expectations and confuse people if we use these symbols and words with other meanings.

The preceding paragraph is controversial. Many mathematicians would say you *certainly* may define "unicorn" to be anything you want. Some of them *redefine common terminology in mathematics books* they write. Those books are very confusing to read.

Another type of fictional object is a __character in a book__, for example Sherlock Holmes. The source of information we have about Sherlock Holmes is the set of stories Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about him.

### What math objects, abstract objects and fictional objects have in common

-   Each one corresponds to a physical arrangement in our brain that connects the concept to certain properties, relationships with other objects, and expectations of behaviors.
-   Each one is talked about using many of the same grammatical constructions as for physical objects.-   We use [proper nouns][16] to refer to them. We say:

-   "42 is an even number."
-   "September has thirty days."
-   "Darth Vader wears a ventilator."

-   We also refer to them using common nouns:

-   "An integer is even if it is divisible by 2."
-   "A month has at least 28 days."
-   "A unicorn has cloven hooves."

-   You can experiment with coming up with sentences in which each type of object is referred to as the object of a verb, the object or a preposition, and so on.
-   This suggests that these concepts are all stored and manipulated in the brain in the same way words denoting physical objects are.

The idea of distinguishing between abstract objects and math objects and in particular the schedule example are from [*What is Mathematics, Really?*][17] by Reuben Hersh.

## Foundational aspects

Sometimes, when asked about how they think about an object, a mathematician will give a description of the object based on some particular construction used in the study of the [foundations of mathematics][20]. Such constructions are useful for showing that some part of math is consistent if some other more primitive part is. However, in my opinion *they are not usually much help in studying the particular object.*

#### Example

It is common in texts on foundations to define each kind of mathematical object as a special kinds of set. For example, the ordered pair (a,b) may be defined to be the set {{a},{a,b}}. This has technical importance in foundations, but it is *totally misleading* to say things such as "The first coordinate of (a,b) *is* {a}".

[Wikipedia][21] has an illuminating discussion of how ordered pairs have been defined.

#### Specification for ordered pairs

All we need to know about the ordered pair (a,b) is that *if two ordered pairs are equal, then their first coordinates are equal and their second coordinates are equal.* So for example, if (a,b)\=(c,d), then a\=c and b\=d. For example, (1,3)≠(2,3) because 1≠2. That is essentially the definition of "ordered pair" in [homotopy type theory][22], a proposed system for providing a foundation for math other than set theory.

#### Example

Usually, a mathematician will simply talk about the number 2 as if it were a specific individual that we are all familiar with. That is because *that is the way a mathematician thinks about it.*

For purposes of foundations, the natural numbers may be defined by the [Peano axioms][23]. It is correct to say that in that axiom system, 2 may be defined by saying that it is something like "the successor of the successor of 0." Other axiom systems define 2 in other ways. It is wrong to say that what 2 *really is* (its "true inner essence") is the successor of the successor of 0.

#### Two controversial statements:

What mathematicians say about math when they *philosophize* about it is (in my opinion) not necessarily trustworthy.

The discussions in this chapter was influenced by these books and papers.
