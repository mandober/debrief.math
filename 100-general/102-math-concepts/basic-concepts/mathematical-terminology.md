# Math :: Mathematical terminology :: Debrief

(debriefs are summaries by the author aka me)

Mathematical entity is a generic name for any *mathematical object* and *mathematical notion*, doubling also as the catch-all *collection* of all mathematical things. Whatever thing you want to discuss in math, it is a math entity. The term entity is just an euphemism for "thing", used in preference to it because it has a strictly more sophisticated ring to it.
