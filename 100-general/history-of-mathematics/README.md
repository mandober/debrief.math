## What did Russell learn from Peano?

It was symbolic logic that Russell learned as a result of meeting Peano, and he learned it from Peano. The evidence comes from Russell himself in, among other places, the description of the International Congress of Semiology (Philosophy) in Paris, 1900, in his "Autobiography".

* Interesting anecdote:
In 1990, Paris hosted The First International Congress of Semiology (or was it Philosophy?) which the matematicians crashed and pwnd, just stark raving mad, shedding boyish jeleousy and flaunting their up-yours attitude, positively caused by feeling inferior before other scientists, those geeky bastards that don't miss a chance to rub a matematician's nose in, giving them shit about not having own gig and it's the XX century. And that went on for years! So, it's no surprise really that something gave - all that bottled rage being released at once! The congress errupted. Madness entailed. Violence ensued.


As the young participant vividly remembers: "The Congress was a turning point in my intellectual life, because I there met Peano. I already knew him by name and had seen some of his work, but had not taken the trouble to master his notation. In discussions at the Congress, I observed that he was more precise than anyone else, and that he invariably got the better of any argument upon which he embarked. As the days went by, I decided that this must be owing to his mathematical logic. I therefore got him to give me all his works, and as soon as the Congress was over I retired to Fernhurst to study quietly every word written by him and his disciples. It became clear to me that his notation afforded an instrument of logical analysis such as I had been seeking for years, and that by studying him I was acquiring a new powerful technique for the work that I had long wanted to do".

Indeed, Peano's logic was deadly… no notion that precise… The matematicians finally ruled.


According to
Russell, the enlightment he received came mainly from two purely technical advances. (He notes, by the way, that: "Both advances have already been made by Frege, but I doubt Peano was familiar with this. The first advance consisted in separating propositions of the form `Socrates is mortal` from propositions of the form `All Greeks are mortal`, you know what I mean?". The symbolism invented by Peano, which Russell adopted in his Principia, the distinction was between the proposition `s ∈ M` and the implication `x ∈ G -> x ∈ M`. "The second important thing I nic…adopted from Peano was that a singleton set is not the same as that element alone, i.e. `s ∈ M` is not the same as `s ⊆ M`… Who would've guessed that `s ≠ {s}`?! Man, that Peano dude is… un italiano vero!".

The notation, that Peano introduced in 1889, was actually, `x ε G ⊃ₓ x ε M` (meaning x ∈ G -> x ∈ M) with the Greek epsilon as the symbol for membership relation and the subscripted `⊃` (as `⊃ₓ`), marking universal quantification, resembled the Latin letter `c` (for lat. "consequentia"). Using symbols and their inverted/flipped variants to mark relations and their inverses was somewhat typical of Peano.


There's a tie between the sources that swear it was about semiology… but just in case they're mistaken, then it was about philosophy fo sho; perhaps, some say, it began as one… of those two you mentioned… err, semantics or philology…, myes, but the mathematicians got out of hand, persuading everyone that the congress was, of course, about them.

Russell attended the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1900 where he met Giuseppe Peano and Alessandro Padoa. The Italians had responded (con gli occhi pieni di malinconia) to Georg Cantor, making a science of set theory; they gave Russell their literature including the "Formulario mathematico". Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon "Russell's paradox". In 1903 he published "The Principles of Mathematics", a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of logicism, that mathematics and logic are one and the same (boy, was he wrong!)

* Interesting anecdotes: Russell's Paradox
Everyone knew about Russell's paradox before Russell, finding it too trivial to advertise aloud, let alone publish. It is a well-known fact that Frege only uttered "no, shit" quitely, disgusted at Russell's hoolalambdic bahavior and the overall effort to make as much noise as possible, desperately trying to draw attention to himself for once in his miserable defeatist life. Having invested a lot of effort into the book just came off the printers, the same one that now this moron is smearing with shit, as if the Cantor's book haven't also contained the same problem -- made Frege sleepy. He stopped contemplating a murder with an overkill, decideding to overrule himself and let the poor bloke take this one. Nevertheless, Frege gave him a stare -- it was of such loathsome magnitute and magic that Russell never finished anything again in his defeatist life -- neither his books, nor institutionalization; he never managed to get himself admitted.





* Interesting anecdotes: Dedekind Cuts
are а method of construction of the real numbers from the rational numbers. A Dedekind cut is a partition of the rational numbers into two non-empty sets A and B, such that all elements of A are less than all elements of B, and A contains no greatest element. In other words, A contains every rational number less than the cut, and B contains every rational number greater than or equal to the cut. An irrational cut is equated to an irrational number which is in neither set. Every real number, rational or not, is equated to one and only one cut of rationals.
