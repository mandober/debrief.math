The earliest records of mathematics show it arising in response to practical needs in agriculture, business, and industry. In Egypt and Mesopotamia, where evidence dates from the 2d and 3d millennia BC, it was used for surveying and mensuration; estimates of the value of π  ([pi][8]) are found in both locations. There is some evidence of similar developments in India and China during this same period, but few records have survived. This early mathematics is generally empirical, arrived at by trial and error as the best available means for obtaining results, with no proofs given. However, it is now known that the Babylonians were aware of the necessity of proofs prior to the Greeks, who had been presumed the originators of this important step.

A profound change occurred in the nature and approach to mathematics with the contributions of the Greeks. The earlier (Hellenic) period is represented by [Thales][9] (6th cent. BC), [Pythagoras][10], [Plato][11], and [Aristotle][12], and by the schools associated with them. The Pythagorean theorem, known earlier in Mesopotamia, was discovered by the Greeks during this period.

During the Golden Age (5th cent. BC), Hippocrates of Chios made the beginnings of an axiomatic approach to geometry and [Zeno of Elea][13] proposed his famous paradoxes concerning the infinite and the infinitesimal, raising questions about the nature of and relationships among points, lines, and numbers. The discovery through geometry of irrational numbers, such as 2, also dates from this period. [Eudoxus of Cnidus][14] (4th cent. BC) resolved certain of the problems by proposing alternative methods to those involving infinitesimals; he is known for his work on geometric proportions and for his exhaustion theory for determining areas and volumes.

The later (Hellenistic) period of Greek science is associated with the school of Alexandria. The greatest work of Greek mathematics, [Euclid][15]'s *Elements* (c.300 BC), appeared at the beginning of this period. Elementary geometry as taught in high school is still largely based on Euclid's presentation, which has served as a model for deductive systems in other parts of mathematics and in other sciences. In this method primitive terms, such as *point* and *line,* are first defined, then certain axioms and postulates relating to them and seeming to follow directly from them are stated without proof; a number of statements are then derived by deduction from the definitions, axioms, and postulates. Euclid also contributed to the development of arithmetic and presented a geometric theory of quadratic equations.

In the 3d cent. BC, [Archimedes][16], in addition to his work in mechanics, made an estimate of π  and used the exhaustion theory of Eudoxus to obtain results that foreshadowed those much later of the integral calculus, and [Apollonius of Perga][17] named the conic sections and gave the first theory for them. A second Alexandrian school of the Roman period included contributions by Menelaus (c.AD 100, spherical triangles), [Heron of Alexandria][18] (geometry), [Ptolemy][19] (AD 150, astronomy, geometry, cartography), [Pappus][20] (3d cent., geometry), and [Diophantus][21] (3d cent., arithmetic).

Following the decline of learning in the West after the 3d cent., the development of mathematics continued in the East. In China, Tsu Ch'ung-Chih estimated π  by inscribed and circumscribed polygons, as Archimedes had done, and in India the numerals now used throughout the civilized world were invented and contributions to geometry were made by [Aryabhata][22] and [Brahmagupta][23] (5th and 6th cent. AD). The Arabs were responsible for preserving the work of the Greeks, which they translated, commented upon, and augmented. In Baghdad, [Al-Khowarizmi][24] (9th cent.) wrote an important work on algebra and introduced the Hindu numerals for the first time to the West, and [Al-Battani][25] worked on trigonometry. In Egypt, [Ibn al-Haytham][26] was concerned with the solids of revolution and geometrical optics. The Persian poet Omar Khayyam wrote on algebra.

Word of the Chinese and Middle Eastern works began to reach the West in the 12th and 13th cent. One of the first important European mathematicians was Leonardo da Pisa (Leonardo [Fibonacci][27]), who wrote on arithmetic and algebra (*Liber abaci,* 1202) and on geometry (*Practica geometriae,* 1220). With the Renaissance came a great revival of interest in learning, and the invention of printing made many of the earlier books widely available. By the end of the 16th cent. advances had been made in algebra by Niccolò [Tartaglia][28] and Girolamo [Cardano][29], in trigonometry by François [Viète][30], and in such areas of applied mathematics as mapmaking by Mercator and others.

The 17th cent., however, saw the greatest revolution in mathematics, as the scientific revolution spread to all fields. Decimal fractions were invented by Simon [Stevin][31] and logarithms by John [Napier][32] and Henry [Briggs][33]; the beginnings of projective geometry were made by Gérard [Desargues][34] and Blaise [Pascal][35]; number theory was greatly extended by Pierre de [Fermat][36]; and the theory of probability was founded by Pascal, Fermat, and others. In the application of mathematics to mechanics and astronomy, [Galileo][37] and Johannes [Kepler][38] made fundamental contributions.

The greatest mathematical advances of the 17th cent., however, were the invention of analytic geometry by René [Descartes][39] and that of the calculus by Isaac [Newton][40] and, independently, by G. W. [Leibniz][41]. Descartes's invention (anticipated by Fermat, whose work was not published until later) made possible the expression of geometric problems in algebraic form and vice versa. It was indispensable in creating the calculus, which built upon and superseded earlier special methods for finding areas, volumes, and tangents to curves, developed by F. B. [Cavalieri][42], Fermat, and others. The calculus is probably the greatest tool ever invented for the mathematical formulation and solution of physical problems.

The history of mathematics in the 18th cent. is dominated by the development of the methods of the calculus and their application to such problems, both terrestrial and celestial, with leading roles being played by the [Bernoulli][43] family (especially Jakob, Johann, and Daniel), Leonhard [Euler][44], Guillaume de L'Hôpital, and J. L. [Lagrange][45]. Important advances in geometry began toward the end of the century with the work of Gaspard [Monge][46] in descriptive geometry and in differential geometry and continued through his influence on others, e.g., his pupil J. V. [Poncelet][47], who founded projective geometry (1822).

The modern period of mathematics dates from the beginning of the 19th cent., and its dominant figure is C. F. [Gauss][48]. In the area of geometry Gauss made fundamental contributions to differential geometry, did much to found what was first called analysis situs but is now called topology, and anticipated (although he did not publish his results) the great breakthrough of non-Euclidean geometry. This breakthrough was made by N. I. [Lobachevsky][49] (1826) and independently by János [Bolyai][50] (1832), the son of a close friend of Gauss, whom each proceeded by establishing the independence of Euclid's fifth (parallel) postulate and showing that a different, self-consistent geometry could be derived by substituting another postulate in its place. Still another non-Euclidean geometry was invented by Bernhard [Riemann][51] (1854), whose work also laid the foundations for the modern tensor calculus description of space, so important in the general theory of relativity.

In the area of arithmetic, number theory, and algebra, Gauss again led the way. He established the modern theory of numbers, gave the first clear exposition of complex numbers, and investigated the functions of complex variables. The concept of number was further extended by W. R. [Hamilton][52], whose theory of quaternions (1843) provided the first example of a noncommutative algebra (i.e., one in which ab ≠ ba). This work was generalized the following year by H. G. [Grassmann][53], who showed that several different consistent algebras may be derived by choosing different sets of axioms governing the operations on the elements of the algebra.

These developments continued with the group theory of M. S. [Lie][54] in the late 19th cent. and reached full expression in the wide scope of modern abstract algebra. Number theory received significant contributions in the latter half of the 19th cent. through the work of Georg [Cantor][55], J. W. R. [Dedekind][56], and K. W. [Weierstrass][57]. Still another influence of Gauss was his insistence on rigorous proof in all areas of mathematics. In analysis this close examination of the foundations of the calculus resulted in A. L. [Cauchy][58]'s theory of limits (1821), which in turn yielded new and clearer definitions of continuity, the derivative, and the definite integral. A further important step toward rigor was taken by Weierstrass, who raised new questions about these concepts and showed that ultimately the foundations of analysis rest on the properties of the real number system.

In the 20th cent. the trend was toward increasing generalization and abstraction, with the elements and operations of systems being defined so broadly that their interpretations connect such areas as algebra, geometry, and topology. The key to this approach was the use of formal axiomatics, in which the notion of axioms as self-evident truths was discarded. Instead the emphasis was placed on such logical concepts as consistency and completeness. The roots of formal axiomatics lie in the discoveries of alternative systems of geometry and algebra in the 19th cent.; the approach was first systematically undertaken by David Hilbert in his work on the foundations of geometry (1899).

The emphasis on deductive logic inherent in this view of mathematics and the discovery of the interconnections between the various branches of mathematics and their ultimate basis in number theory led to intense activity in the field of mathematical logic after the turn of the century. Rival schools of thought grew up under the leadership of Hilbert, Bertrand [Russell][59] and A. N. [Whitehead][60], and L. E. J. Brouwer. Important contributions in the investigation of the logical foundations of mathematics were made by Kurt [Gödel][61] and A. Church.
