A *finitary operation* is an operation with a finite arity (the number of input values is finite).

An *infinitary operation* is an operation with an infinite arity (the number of input values is infinite).

In standard mathematics, an operation is finitary by definition, so these terms are usually only used in the context of infinitary logic.
