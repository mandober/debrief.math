# Mathematics :: Elementary mathematical concepts

What should be called an elementary mathematical concept? Historically, math concepts have often appeared in an unsensible ordering, but probably the oldest mathematical concept is that of *quantity* concretized as a *number*. The concept of space and objects within it have probably followed. Imperfect objects encountered in the world have been conceptualized into perfect abstractions in the mind. 

Discerning triangular from the various patterns and recognizing that different triangular shapes nevertheless fall into the same category is a gigantic display of abstraction powers of the modern homini no other species could even begin to understand (except dolphins).
