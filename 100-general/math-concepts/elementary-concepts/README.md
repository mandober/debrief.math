# Mathematics :: Elementary mathematical concepts

What should be called an elementary mathematical concept?

Historically, math concepts have often appeared in an unsensible ordering, but probably the oldest mathematical concept is that of *quantity* concretized as a *number*. The concept of space and objects within space have probably followed. Imperfect objects encountered in the world have been conceptualized into perfect abstractions in the mind in the field of geometry.

Discerning triangular from the various patterns and recognizing that different triangular shapes nevertheless fall into the same category is a gigantic display of abstraction powers of the modern homini no other species could even begin to understand (except dolphins).

Thus, arithemtic and geometry, known to the ancient greeks, are the oldest areas of math. Initiations of new fields have been advancing since then, but the first development in a relatively small period was calculus in XVI. The fifth gear was reached around the turn of the XIX to XX century.
