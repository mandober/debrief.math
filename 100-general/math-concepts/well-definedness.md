# Well-definedness

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined

In mathematics, a *well-defined expression* (unambiguous expression) is an expression whose definition assigns it a unique *interpretation* or *value*. Otherwise, the expression is said to be ill-defined or ambiguous.

A *function* is well defined if it gives the same result when the *representation* of the input changes (without changing the input value), e.g. if `f : ℝ → ℝ`, and `f(0.5) = f(1/2)`, then `f` is well-defined.

We have to be careful when defining functions on quotient sets obtained from equivalence relations so that changing representatives of an equivalence class remains compatible with the function (operation).
