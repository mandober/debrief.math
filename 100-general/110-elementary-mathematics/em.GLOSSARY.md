# GLOSSARY

## Equation
An equation is a *formula* of the form `A = B`, where `A` and `B` are *expressions* that may contain one or several *variables*, called *unknowns*, and "=" denotes the *equality* binary relation. Although written in the form of a *proposition*, an equation is not a *statement* (it doesn't have a truth value), but represents a problem that is to be solve by finding the values, called solutions, that, when substituted in for the unknowns, establishes the equality between the expressions on the left and right side, `A = B`. (For example, -42 is the unique solution, for x ∈ ℤ, of the equation "x ÷ 7 - 1 = x ÷ 6"). The same principle is encountered in the pure FPLs, which don't have assignment, so an expression like `sum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs` also establishes the equality between the left and right side, that can be made evident by repeatedly and consistently *substituting equals for equals*, in the process known as the *simplification*.

## Formula
A formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and *formation rules* of a given *logical language*. For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion; but, having done this once in terms of some parameter, mathematicians have produced a formula (V = 4/3 π r³) that can be used to calculate the volume. Syntactically, a *well-formed formula* is a syntactically valid expression (mathematical object) constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language (given a set of symbols of a logical language, all constructible expressions are formulas, but only the syntactically valid are expressions are WFFs; they may still be semantically weird, however). In mathematics, a formula generally refers to an *identity*, which is a logical proposition (possibly in the form of a formula) that should hold; however, the goal is the same to that of equality binary relation, i.e. to establish the equality between two mathematical expressions. Some of the most important propositions (identity) are awarded the status of mathematical *theorems*.
