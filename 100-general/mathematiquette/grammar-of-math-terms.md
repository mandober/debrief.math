## Definiteness and articles

- Definite article `the`, before a singular or plural noun
- Indefinite article, `a` (before a singular noun beginning with a consonant sound), `an` (before a singular noun beginning with a vowel sound). The plural form is `some` - use it to indicate an unspecified, limited amount (but more than one), e.g. (an apple, some apples).

- *Count nouns* - refers to items that can be counted and are either singular or plural. Count nouns are either singular (one) or plural (more than one).

- *Noncount nouns* - refers to items that are not counted and are always singular. Noncount nouns are always in singular form.

Noncount nouns are those which usually cannot be counted.
- Most abstract nouns (advice, anger, beauty, confidence, courage, employment, fun, happiness, health, honesty, information, intelligence, knowledge, love, poverty, satisfaction, truth, wealth).
- Areas of study (history, math, biology).
- Languages (Chinese, Spanish, Russian, English).
- Other (clothing, equipment, furniture, homework, jewelry, luggage, lumber, machinery, mail, money, news, poetry, pollution, research, scenery, traffic, transportation, violence, weather, work).
- Geographical names: some require `the` (the Gobi Desert, the United Arab Emirates, the Sacramento River) and some `∅` (streets, parks, cities, states, counties, most countries, continents, bays, single lakes, single mountains, islands; Japan, Mt. Everest, San Francisco Bay).


FUN: In Gaelic there are 8 different forms of the definite article: 
`an`, `am`, `a'`, `an t-`, `na`, `na h-`




Articles                    | COUNT | NON-COUNT
----------------------------|-------|-----------
specific identity not known | a/an  | ∅
specific identity known     | the   | the
things in general           | ∅     | ∅


Use the null article with plural count nouns or noncount nouns used to mean "all" or "in general":
- Trees are beautiful in the fall.
- He was asking for advice.
- I do not like ◌ coffee.

## Zero and null articles in English

definedness: ◌ ⊑ an ⊑ the ⊑ ∅
- The **zero article**, ◌, occurs in indefinite noun phrases (least defined)
- The **null article**, ∅, occurs in definite noun phrases (most defined)



- "up to isomorphism" vs "up to an isomorphism"
- "unique up to isomorphism" vs "unique up to an isomorphism"

Definite articles must not be used in things like "in Figure 3" or "see Equation 7", because here "Figure" and "Equation" are treated as proper nouns (and thus capitalized).

- A line that intersects (the) circle C.
- We can see that (the) function f has a maximum at x=0.
- Draw a line past (the) edge E. 

In mathtextbook-speak the use of "the" is optional (and usually omitted).

No article is necessary if NPs can be proper nouns.


## Zero Article

This is the absence of an article before a noun that is a general, indefinite concept, or is a plural noun. For example, "math" is a noun that is general and no article needs to be applied; likewise, "reactions" is a plural, general concept that does not require an article.

The zero article differs from an indefinite article as zero-article nouns are typically uncountable, while indefinite nouns are just not specified. For example, "an equation" is an indefinite noun as we do not know what equation the writer is referring to, while "equations" is plural and, in this case, conceptual, as we do not have an identified quantity, so this noun has no article.

To determine whether an article is definite or indefinite, first determine if the noun is countable or uncountable. If it is uncountable, use the zero article. If it is countable, determine if this is the first usage or if the noun refers to a non-specific usage. If the noun is non-specific or if this is the first time using the noun, it is indefinite and an indefinite article must be used. If it is countable and specific, the definite article should be used. 

## The null article

In English grammar, the term null (zero) article refers to an occasion in speech or writing where a noun phrase is not preceded by an article. The zero article is also known as the zero determiner.

In general, no article is used with
- proper nouns
- mass nouns where the reference is indefinite
- plural count nouns where the reference is indefinite (in sandy soil)
- means of transport (by plane)
- common expressions of time and place (in winter, at midnight, in jail)
- before words for institutions (when used in their "institutional" sense): school, college, class, prison, camp


e.g.
- to hold `the` position of `∅` director
- `the` students start `∅` school in `the` fall
- every mile is two in `∅` winter
- `∅` college provides opportunities
- when he was in `the` hospital (en-us)
- when he was in `∅` hospital (en-uk)

### Zero article with plural count nouns and mass nouns

"The loosest and therefore most frequent type of generic statement is that expressed by the zero article with plural count nouns or with mass nouns."

**Count nouns** are those that can form a plural (propostion, axiom, theory). In their plural form, count nouns are sometimes used without an article, especially when they are referred to generically. The same is true when the noun is plural but of indefinite number.

e.g.
- Dogs love to run around outside.
- The boy loves to play with toys.

**Mass nouns** are those that cannot be counted, such as air or sadness. They also include nouns that are not usually counted but that can be counted in some situations, such as water or meat. These nouns can be counted using certain measurement words like "some" or "much".

e.g.
- Clean air is important for a healthy environment.
- The man was overcome by sadness when he lost his home.
