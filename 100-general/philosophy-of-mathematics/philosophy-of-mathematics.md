# Philosophy of mathematics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics

*The philosophy of mathematics* is the branch of philosophy that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics, aiming to understand the nature and methods of mathematics, and to reveal the place of mathematics in everyday life.

The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.

The philosophy of mathematics has two major themes:
1. Mathematical realism
2. Mathematical anti-realism

## History

The origin of mathematics is subject to arguments and disagreements. Whether the birth of mathematics was a random happening or induced by necessity during the development of other subjects, like physics, is still a matter of prolific debates.

**Pythagoras** is considered the father of geometry and mathematics, setting the foundation for Euclid and Euclidean Geometry; he is also the founder of Pythagoreanism, which is a mathematical and philosophical model to map the universe.
