The Russell's paradox and similar mishaps had a variety of effects, especially on people interested in the foundations of mathematics, for it began to appear that the whole structure of their beloved discipline was shaky or perhaps was built on a weak foundation. Clearly, the traditional view of mathematics as an exact, logical, and certain discipline had been badly eroded. Starting around the turn of the 20th century, a fairly large group of mathematicians became engaged in studies along this line, but they divided into several mutually antagonistic groups. These gradually formed into three main groups, or schools.

The first school we talk about is *logicism*, whose main exponent was `Bertrand Russell`. Russell believed that pure mathematics could be built on a small group of fundamental logical concepts, and that all its propositions could be deduced from a small number of basic logical principles. He also hoped to deal with the paradoxes, which he attempted to do by introducing some new approaches to the problem. Yet Russell had built much of his work on the foundation supplied by `Cantor`'s set theory, and `Henri Poincare`, a world-class French mathematician, had been, after `Kronecker`'s death in 1891, the prime opponent of Cantor's mathematics. Result: Poincare turned his guns on Russell's logicism. Though the two men had high respect for each other, they had no hesitation in attacking the other's position.

The other two schools that arose at about the same time were *intuitionism* and *formalism*, whose leaders were `L. E. J. Brouwer` and `David Hilbert`. In this battle, all sorts of differences, including the players' nationalities, came into play. When the battle enlarged to bring in supporters, Albert Einstein, who chose to remain neutral, described it as "the War of the Frogs and the Mice".
