# Areas of mathematics - Wikipedia

Mathematics encompasses a growing variety and depth of subjects over its history, and comprehension of it requires a system to categorize and organize these various subjects into a more general areas of mathematics. A number of different classification schemes have arisen, and though they share some similarities, there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve.
[Mathematics][1] encompasses a growing variety and depth of subjects over its [history][2], and comprehension of it requires a system to categorize and organize these various subjects into a more general __areas of mathematics__. A number of different classification schemes have arisen, and though they share some similarities, there are differences due in part to the different purposes they serve.

A traditional division of mathematics is into [pure mathematics][3]; mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest, and [applied mathematics][4]; the mathematics that can be directly applied to real-world problems.[\[note 1\]][5] This division is not always clear and many subjects have been developed as pure mathematics to find unexpected applications later on. Broad divisions, such as [discrete mathematics][6], [computational mathematics][7] and so on have emerged more recently.

An ideal system of classification permits adding new areas into the organization of previous knowledge, and fitting surprising discoveries and unexpected interactions into the outline. For example, the [Langlands program][8] has found unexpected connections between areas previously thought unconnected, at least [Galois groups][9], [Riemann surfaces][10] and [number theory][11].

## Classification systems\[[edit][12]\]

-   Wikipedia uses a [Category: Mathematics][13] system on its articles, and also has a [list of mathematics lists][14].
-   The [Mathematics Subject Classification][15] (MSC) is produced by the staff of the review databases [Mathematical Reviews][16] and [Zentralblatt MATH][17]. Many mathematics journals ask authors to label their papers with MSC subject codes. The MSC divides mathematics into over 60 areas, with further subdivisions within each area.
-   In the [Library of Congress Classification][18], mathematics is assigned the many subclass QA within the class Q (Science). The LCC defines broad divisions, and individual subjects are assigned specific numerical values.
-   The [Dewey Decimal Classification][19] assigns mathematics to division 510, with subdivisions for [Algebra][20] & [Number theory][21], [Arithmetic][22], [Topology][23], [Analysis][24], [Geometry][25], [Numerical analysis][26], and [Probabilities][27] & [Applied mathematics][28].
-   The [Categories within Mathematics][29] list is used by the [arXiv][30] for categorizing [preprints][31]. It differs from MSC; for example, it includes things like [Quantum algebra][32].
-   The [IMU][33] uses its [programme structure][34] for organizing the lectures at its [ICM][35] every four years. One top-level section that MSC doesn't have is [Lie theory][36].
-   The [ACM Computing Classification System][37] includes a couple of mathematical [categories][38] F. Theory of Computation and G. Mathematics of Computing.
-   [MathOverflow][39] has a [tag system][40].
-   Mathematics book publishers such as [Springer][41] ([subdisciplines][42]), [Cambridge][43] ([Browse Mathematics and statistics][44]) and the [AMS][45] ([subject area][46]) use their own subject lists on their websites to enable customers to browse books or filter searches by subdiscipline, including topics such as [mathematical biology][47] and [mathematical finance][48] as top-level headings.
-   Schools and other educational bodies have [syllabuses][49].
-   [SIAM][50] divides the areas of applied mathematics in [activity groups][51].

## Major divisions of mathematics\[[edit][52]\]

### Pure mathematics\[[edit][53]\]

#### [Foundations][54]\[[edit][55]\]

Mathematicians have always worked with logic and [symbols][56], but for centuries the underlying laws of logic were taken for granted, and never expressed symbolically. __Mathematical logic__, also known as __symbolic logic__, was developed when people finally realized that the tools of mathematics can be used to study the structure of logic itself. Areas of research in this field have expanded rapidly, and are usually subdivided into several distinct subfields.

-   [Proof theory][57] and [constructive mathematics][58] : Proof theory grew out of [David Hilbert][59]'s ambitious program to formalize all the proofs in mathematics. The most famous result in the field is encapsulated in [Gödel's incompleteness theorems][60]. A closely related and now quite popular concept is the idea of [Turing machines][61]. __Constructivism__ is the outgrowth of [Brouwer][62]'s unorthodox view of the nature of logic itself; constructively speaking, mathematicians cannot assert "Either a circle is round, or it is not" until they have actually exhibited a circle and measured its roundness.

-   [Model theory][63] : Model theory studies mathematical [structures][64] in a general framework. Its main tool is [first-order logic][65].

-   [Set theory][66] : A [set][67] can be thought of as a collection of distinct things united by some common feature. Set theory is subdivided into three main areas. [Naive set theory][68] is the original set theory developed by mathematicians at the end of the 19th century. [Axiomatic set theory][69] is a rigorous [axiomatic][70] theory developed in response to the discovery of serious flaws (such as [Russell's paradox][71]) in naive set theory. It treats sets as "whatever satisfies the axioms", and the notion of collections of things serves only as motivation for the axioms. [Internal set theory][72] is an axiomatic extension of set theory that supports a [logically consistent][73] identification of *illimited* (enormously large) and *infinitesimal* (unimaginably small) elements within the [real numbers][74]. See also [List of set theory topics][75].

-   [Category theory][76] : A [category][77] expands on the notion of sets to consider both collections of distinct objects and relationships between them, referred to as "maps," "morphisms," or "arrows," organizing mathematical information into the structure of a [labeled][78] [directed graph][79]. As an organizational structure, category theory finds common usage throughout many areas of pure mathematics, particularly in subjects with algebraic connections such as [representation theory][80], [algebraic topology][81], [algebraic geometry][82], [homology theory][83], [homotopy theory][84], and [homological algebra][85]. However, due to its ubiquitous structure, category theory has seen applications in many other areas of mathematics, as well as in computer science (particularly [functional programming][86]), physics, and other subjects.

#### [Analysis][87]\[[edit][88]\]

Within mathematics, *analysis* is the branch that focuses on [functions][89], [limits][90], [derivatives][91], [rates of change][92], [integrals][93], and multiple things changing relative to (or independently of) one another.

Major branches of analysis include [real analysis][94], [complex analysis][95], [functional analysis][96], [measure theory][97], and analysis is frequently used in other mathematical disciplines such as [differential equations][98], [numerical analysis][99], and [differential geometry][100].

Modern analysis is a vast and rapidly expanding branch of mathematics that touches almost every other subdivision of the discipline, finding direct and indirect applications in topics as diverse as [number theory][101], [cryptography][102], and [abstract algebra][103]. It is also the language of science itself and is used across [chemistry][104], [biology][105], and [physics][106], from [astrophysics][107] to [X-ray crystallography][108].

#### [Algebra][109]\[[edit][110]\]

The study of structure begins with [numbers][111], first the familiar [natural numbers][112] and [integers][113] and their [arithmetical][114] operations, which are recorded in [elementary algebra][115]. The deeper properties of these numbers are studied in [number theory][116]. The investigation of methods to solve equations leads to the field of [abstract algebra][117], which, among other things, studies [groups][118], [rings][119], and [fields][120], structures that generalize the properties possessed by everyday numbers. Long standing questions about [compass and straightedge][121] constructions were finally settled by [Galois theory][122]. The physically important concept of [vectors][123], generalized to [vector spaces][124], is studied in [linear algebra][125]. The study of general [algebraic structures][126] by their behavior in vector spaces is known as [representation theory][127]. Themes common to all kinds of algebraic structures are studied in [universal algebra][128].

-   [Order theory][129] : For any two distinct real numbers, one must be greater than the other. Order theory extends this idea to sets in general. It includes notions like [lattices][130] and ordered [algebraic structures][131]. See also the [order theory glossary][132] and the [list of order topics][133].

-   General [algebraic systems][134] : Given a [set][135], different ways of combining or relating members of that set can be defined. If these obey certain rules, then a particular algebraic structure is formed. [Universal algebra][136] is the more formal study of these structures and systems.

-   [Field theory][137] and polynomials : Field theory studies the properties of [fields][138]. A field is a mathematical entity for which addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are [well-defined][139]. A polynomial is an expression in which constants and variables are combined using only addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

-   [Commutative rings][140] and [algebras][141] : In [ring theory][142], a branch of abstract algebra, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation obeys the [commutative law][143]. This means that if *a* and *b* are any elements of the ring, then *a*×*b* = *b*×*a*. Commutative algebra is the field of study of commutative rings and their [ideals][144], [modules][145] and algebras. It is foundational both for [algebraic geometry][146] and for algebraic number theory. The most prominent examples of commutative rings are [rings of polynomials][147].

##### [History][148] and [biography][149]\[[edit][150]\]

The history of mathematics is inextricably intertwined with the subject itself. This is perfectly natural: mathematics has an internal organic structure, deriving new theorems from those that have come before. As each new generation of mathematicians builds upon the achievements of their ancestors, the subject itself expands and grows new layers.

##### [Recreational mathematics][151]\[[edit][152]\]

From [magic squares][153] to the [Mandelbrot set][154], numbers have been a source of amusement and delight for millions of people throughout the ages. Many important branches of "serious" mathematics have their roots in what was once a mere puzzle and/or game.

#### [Number theory][155]\[[edit][156]\]

[Number theory][157] is the study of numbers and the properties of operations between them. Number theory is traditionally concerned with the properties of [integers][158], but more recently, it has come to be concerned with wider classes of problems that have arisen naturally from the study of integers.

-   [Arithmetic][159] : An elementary part of number theory that primarily focuses upon the study of [natural numbers][160], [integers][161], [fractions][162], and [decimals][163], as well as the properties of the traditional operations on them: [addition][164], [subtraction][165], [multiplication][166] and [division][167]. Up until the 19th century, *arithmetic* and *number theory* were synonyms, but the evolution and growth of the field has resulted in arithmetic referring only to the elementary branch of number theory.

-   Elementary number theory: The study of integers at a higher level than [arithmetic][168], where the term 'elementary' here refers to the fact that no techniques from other mathematical fields are used.

-   [Analytic number theory][169] : [Calculus][170] and [complex analysis][171] are used as tools to study the integers.

-   [Algebraic number theory][172] : The techniques of [abstract algebra][173] are used to study the integers, as well as [algebraic numbers][174], the roots of [polynomials][175] with integer [coefficients][176].

-   Other number theory subfields : [Geometric number theory][177]; [combinatorial number theory][178]; [transcendental number theory][179]; and [computational number theory][180]. See also the [list of number theory topics][181].

#### [Combinatorics][182]\[[edit][183]\]

Combinatorics is the study of finite or discrete collections of objects that satisfy specified criteria. In particular, it is concerned with "counting" the objects in those collections ([enumerative combinatorics][184]) and with deciding whether certain "optimal" objects exist ([extremal combinatorics][185]). It includes [graph theory][186], used to describe interconnected objects (a graph in this sense is a network, or collection of connected points). See also the [list of combinatorics topics][187], [list of graph theory topics][188] and [glossary of graph theory][189]. A *combinatorial flavour* is present in many parts of [problem solving][190].

#### [Geometry][191]\[[edit][192]\]

Geometry deals with spatial relationships, using fundamental qualities or [axioms][193]. Such axioms can be used in conjunction with mathematical definitions for [points][194], [straight lines][195], [curves][196], [surfaces][197], and solids to draw logical conclusions. See also [List of geometry topics][198].

-   [Convex geometry][199]: Includes the study of objects such as [polytopes][200] and [polyhedra][201]. See also [List of convexity topics][202].

-   [Discrete geometry][203] and [combinatorial geometry][204]: The study of geometrical objects and properties that are [discrete][205] or [combinatorial][206], either by their nature or by their representation. It includes the study of shapes such as the [Platonic solids][207] and the notion of [tessellation][208].

-   [Differential geometry][209]: The study of geometry using calculus. It is very closely related to [differential topology][210]. Covers such areas as [Riemannian geometry][211], [curvature][212] and [differential geometry of curves][213]. See also the [glossary of differential geometry and topology][214].

-   [Algebraic geometry][215]: Given a [polynomial][216] of two real [variables][217], the points on a plane where that function is zero will form a curve. An [algebraic curve][218] extends this notion to polynomials over a [field][219] in a given number of variables. Algebraic geometry may be viewed as the study of these curves. See also the [list of algebraic geometry topics][220] and [list of algebraic surfaces][221].
    -   [Real algebraic geometry][222]: The study of [semialgebraic sets][223], i.e. real number solutions to algebraic [inequalities][224] with real number coefficients, and mappings between them.

-   [Arithmetic geometry][225]: The study of [schemes][226] of finite type over the [spectrum][227] of the [ring of integers][228]. Alternatively defined as the application of the techniques of algebraic geometry to problems in [number theory][229].

-   [Diophantine geometry][230]: The study of the points of [algebraic varieties][231] with coordinates in [fields][232] that are not [algebraically closed][233] and occur in [algebraic number theory][234], such as the field of [rational numbers][235], [number fields][236], [finite fields][237], [function fields][238], and [*p*\-adic fields][239], but not including the [real numbers][240].

-   [Fractal geometry][241]: The study of fractals, geometric objects exhibiting [self-similar][242] behavior. Common examples such as the [mandelbrot set][243] and the [cantor set][244] motivate the study of fractal geometry, and the subject enjoys applications toward many other disciplines both within mathematics and the sciences.

#### [Topology][245]\[[edit][246]\]

Deals with the properties of a figure that do not change when the figure is continuously deformed. The main areas are point set topology (or [general topology][247]), [algebraic topology][248], and the topology of [manifolds][249], defined below.

-   [General topology][250]: Also called *point set topology*. Properties of [topological spaces][251]. Includes such notions as [open][252] and [closed][253] [sets][254], [compact spaces][255], [continuous functions][256], [convergence][257], [separation axioms][258], [metric spaces][259], [dimension theory][260]. See also the [glossary of general topology][261] and the [list of general topology topics][262].

-   [Algebraic topology][263]: Properties of algebraic objects associated with a topological space and how these algebraic objects capture properties of such spaces. (Some of these algebraic objects are examples of [functors][264].) Contains areas like [homology theory][265], [cohomology theory][266], [homotopy theory][267], and [homological algebra][268]. Homotopy deals with [homotopy groups][269] (including the [fundamental group][270]) as well as [simplicial complexes][271] and [CW complexes][272] (also called *cell complexes*). See also the [list of algebraic topology topics][273].

-   [Differential topology][274]: The field dealing with [differentiable functions][275] on [differentiable manifolds][276], which can be thought of as an *n*:[dimensional][277] generalization of a [surface][278] in the usual 3-dimensional [Euclidean space][279].

### Applied mathematics\[[edit][280]\]

#### Probability and statistics\[[edit][281]\]

-   [Probability theory][282]: The mathematical theory of [random][283] phenomena. Probability theory studies [random variables][284] and [events][285], which are mathematical abstractions of [nondeterministic][286] events or measured quantities. See also [Category:probability theory][287], and the [list of probability topics][288].
    -   [Stochastic processes][289]: An extension of probability theory that studies collections of random variables, such as [time series][290] or [spatial processes][291]. See also [List of stochastic processes topics][292], and [Category:Stochastic processes][293].
-   [Statistics][294]: The science of making effective use of numerical [data][295] from experiments or from populations of individuals. Statistics includes not only the collection, analysis and interpretation of such data, but also the planning of the collection of data, in terms of the design of [surveys][296] and [experiments][297]. See also the [list of statistical topics][298].

#### Computational sciences\[[edit][299]\]

-   [Numerical analysis][300]: Many problems in mathematics cannot in general be solved exactly. Numerical analysis is the study of [iterative methods][301] and [algorithms][302] for approximately solving problems to a specified error bound. Includes [numerical differentiation][303], [numerical integration][304] and [numerical methods][305]; c.f. [scientific computing][306]. See also [List of numerical analysis topics][307].

-   [Computer algebra][308]: This area is also called __symbolic computation__ or __algebraic computation__. It deals with exact computation, for example with integers of arbitrary size, polynomials or elements of finite fields. It includes also the computation with non numeric mathematical objects like polynomial [ideals][309] or series.

#### Mathematical physics\[[edit][310]\]

-   [Classical Mechanics][311]: Addresses and describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies.

-   [Mechanics of structures][312]: Mechanics of structures is a field of study within [applied mechanics][313] that investigates the behavior of structures under mechanical loads, such as bending of a beam, buckling of a column, torsion of a shaft, deflection of a thin shell, and vibration of a bridge.

-   [Mechanics of deformable solids][314]: Most real-world objects are not point-like nor perfectly rigid. More importantly, objects change shape when subjected to forces. This subject has a very strong overlap with [continuum mechanics][315], which is concerned with continuous matter. It deals with such notions as [stress][316], [strain][317] and [elasticity][318].

-   [Fluid mechanics][319]: [Fluids][320] in this sense includes not just [liquids][321], but flowing [gases][322], and even [solids][323] under certain situations. (For example, dry [sand][324] can behave like a fluid). It includes such notions as [viscosity][325], [turbulent flow][326] and [laminar flow][327] (its opposite).

-   [Particle mechanics][328]: In mathematics, a [particle][329] is a point-like, perfectly rigid, solid object. Particle mechanics deals with the results of subjecting particles to forces. It includes [celestial mechanics][330]—the study of the motion of celestial objects.

#### Other applied mathematics\[[edit][331]\]

-   [Operations research][332] (OR): Also known as operational research, OR provides optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. OR uses [mathematical modeling][333], [statistical analysis][334], and [mathematical optimization][335].

-   [Mathematical programming][336]: Mathematical programming (or mathematical optimization) minimizes (or maximizes) a real-valued function over a domain that is often specified by constraints on the variables. Mathematical programming studies these problems and develops [iterative methods][337] and [algorithms][338] for their solution.
