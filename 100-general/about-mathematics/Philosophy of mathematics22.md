The __philosophy of mathematics__ is the [branch][2] of [philosophy][3] that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of [mathematics][4]. It aims to understand the nature and [methods][5] of mathematics, and find out the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.

The philosophy of mathematics has two major themes; Mathematical realism and Mathematic anti-realism.

## History\[[edit][6]\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Pythagoras_in_the_Roman_Forum%2C_Colosseum.jpg/250px-Pythagoras_in_the_Roman_Forum%2C_Colosseum.jpg)][7]

The origin of mathematics is subject to arguments and disagreements. Whether the birth of mathematics was a random happening or induced by necessity during the development of other subjects, like physics, is still a matter of prolific debates.[\[1\]][8][\[2\]][9]

Many thinkers have contributed their ideas concerning the nature of mathematics. Today, some\[*[who?][10]*\] philosophers of mathematics aim to give accounts of this form of inquiry and its products as they stand, while others emphasize a role for themselves that goes beyond simple interpretation to critical analysis. There are traditions of mathematical philosophy in both [Western philosophy][11] and [Eastern philosophy][12]. Western philosophies of mathematics go as far back as [Pythagoras][13], who described the theory "everything is mathematics" ([mathematicism][14]), [Plato][15], who paraphrased Pythagoras, and studied the [ontological status][16] of mathematical objects, and [Aristotle][17], who studied [logic][18] and issues related to [infinity][19] (actual versus potential).

[Greek philosophy][20] on mathematics was strongly influenced by their study of [geometry][21]. For example, at one time, the Greeks held the opinion that 1 (one) was not a [number][22], but rather a unit of arbitrary length. A number was defined as a multitude. Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus not "truly" a number. At another point, a similar argument was made that 2 was not a number but a fundamental notion of a pair. These views come from the heavily geometric straight-edge-and-compass viewpoint of the Greeks: just as lines drawn in a geometric problem are measured in proportion to the first arbitrarily drawn line, so too are the numbers on a number line measured in proportion to the arbitrary first "number" or "one".\[*[citation needed][23]*\]

These earlier Greek ideas of numbers were later upended by the discovery of the [irrationality][24] of the square root of two. [Hippasus][25], a disciple of [Pythagoras][26], showed that the diagonal of a unit square was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the unit square to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea. [Simon Stevin][27] was one of the first in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16th century. Beginning with [Leibniz][28], the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of [Frege][29] and of [Russell][30], but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

### Contemporary philosophy\[[edit][31]\]

A perennial issue in the philosophy of mathematics concerns the relationship between logic and mathematics at their joint foundations. While 20th-century philosophers continued to ask the questions mentioned at the outset of this article, the philosophy of mathematics in the 20th century was characterized by a predominant interest in [formal logic][32], [set theory][33] (both [naive set theory][34] and [axiomatic set theory][35]), and foundational issues.

It is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their "truthfulness" remains elusive. Investigations into this issue are known as the [foundations of mathematics][36] program.

At the start of the 20th century, philosophers of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical [epistemology][37] and [ontology][38]. Three schools, [formalism][39], [intuitionism][40], and [logicism][41], emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and [analysis][42] in particular, did not live up to the standards of [certainty][43] and [rigor][44] that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.

Surprising and counter-intuitive developments in formal logic and set theory early in the 20th century led to new questions concerning what was traditionally called the *foundations of mathematics*. As the century unfolded, the initial focus of concern expanded to an open exploration of the fundamental axioms of mathematics, the axiomatic approach having been taken for granted since the time of [Euclid][45] around 300 BCE as the natural basis for mathematics. Notions of [axiom][46], [proposition][47] and [proof][48], as well as the notion of a proposition being true of a mathematical object (see [Assignment][49]), were formalized, allowing them to be treated mathematically. The [Zermelo–Fraenkel][50] axioms for set theory were formulated which provided a conceptual framework in which much mathematical discourse would be interpreted. In mathematics, as in physics, new and unexpected ideas had arisen and significant changes were coming. With [Gödel numbering][51], propositions could be interpreted as referring to themselves or other propositions, enabling inquiry into the [consistency][52] of mathematical theories. This reflective critique in which the theory under review "becomes itself the object of a mathematical study" led [Hilbert][53] to call such study *[metamathematics][54]* or *[proof theory][55]*.[\[3\]][56]

At the middle of the century, a new mathematical theory was created by [Samuel Eilenberg][57] and [Saunders Mac Lane][58], known as [category theory][59], and it became a new contender for the natural language of mathematical thinking.[\[4\]][60] As the 20th century progressed, however, philosophical opinions diverged as to just how well-founded were the questions about foundations that were raised at the century's beginning. [Hilary Putnam][61] summed up one common view of the situation in the last third of the century by saying:

> When philosophy discovers something wrong with science, sometimes science has to be changed—[Russell's paradox][62] comes to mind, as does [Berkeley][63]'s attack on the actual [infinitesimal][64]—but more often it is philosophy that has to be changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that "philosophical interpretation" is just what mathematics doesn't need.[\[5\]][65]: 169–170 

Philosophy of mathematics today proceeds along several different lines of inquiry, by philosophers of mathematics, logicians, and mathematicians, and there are many schools of thought on the subject. The schools are addressed separately in the next section, and their assumptions explained.

## Major themes\[[edit][66]\]

### Mathematical realism\[[edit][67]\]

__Mathematical realism__, like [realism][68] in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human [mind][69]. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; [triangles][70], for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.

Many working mathematicians have been mathematical realists; they see themselves as discoverers of naturally occurring objects. Examples include [Paul Erdős][71] and [Kurt Gödel][72]. Gödel believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the [continuum hypothesis][73] conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. Gödel suggested that quasi-empirical methodology could be used to provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture.

Within realism, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them. Major forms of mathematical realism include [Platonism][74] and [Aristotelianism][75].

### Mathematical anti-realism\[[edit][76]\]

__Mathematical anti-realism__ generally holds that mathematical statements have truth-values, but that they do not do so by [corresponding][77] to a special realm of immaterial or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include [formalism][78] and [fictionalism][79].

## Contemporary schools of thought\[[edit][80]\]

### Artistic\[[edit][81]\]

The view that claims that [mathematics][82] is the [aesthetic][83] combination of assumptions, and then also claims that mathematics is an [art][84]. A famous [mathematician][85] who claims that is the British [G. H. Hardy][86].[\[6\]][87] For Hardy, in his book, *[A Mathematician's Apology][88]*, the definition of mathematics was more like the aesthetic combination of concepts.[\[7\]][89]

### Platonism\[[edit][90]\]

__Mathematical Platonism__ is the form of realism that suggests that mathematical entities are abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging. This is often claimed to be the view most people have of numbers. The term *Platonism* is used because such a view is seen to parallel [Plato][91]'s [Theory of Forms][92] and a "World of Ideas" (Greek: *eidos* (εἶδος)) described in Plato's [allegory of the cave][93]: the everyday world can only imperfectly approximate an unchanging, ultimate reality. Both Plato's cave and Platonism have meaningful, not just superficial connections, because Plato's ideas were preceded and probably influenced by the hugely popular *[Pythagoreans][94]* of ancient Greece, who believed that the world was, quite literally, generated by [numbers][95].

A major question considered in mathematical Platonism is: Precisely where and how do the mathematical entities exist, and how do we know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the [Ultimate Ensemble][96], a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kurt_g%C3%B6del.jpg)][97]

[Kurt Gödel][98]'s Platonism[\[8\]][99] postulates a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things [Husserl][100] said about mathematics, and supports [Kant][101]'s idea that mathematics is [synthetic][102] *[a priori][103]*.) [Davis][104] and [Hersh][105] have suggested in their 1999 book *The Mathematical Experience* that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to [formalism][106]. The mathematician [Alexander Grothendieck][107] was also a Platonist.

__Full-blooded Platonism__ is a modern variation of Platonism, which is in reaction to the fact that different sets of mathematical entities can be proven to exist depending on the axioms and inference rules employed (for instance, the law of the [excluded middle][108], and the [axiom of choice][109]). It holds that all mathematical entities exist. They may be provable, even if they cannot all be derived from a single consistent set of axioms.[\[9\]][110]

__Set-theoretic realism__ (also __set-theoretic Platonism__)[\[10\]][111] a position defended by [Penelope Maddy][112], is the view that [set theory][113] is about a single universe of sets.[\[11\]][114] This position (which is also known as __naturalized Platonism__ because it is a [naturalized][115] version of mathematical Platonism) has been criticized by Mark Balaguer on the basis of [Paul Benacerraf][116]'s [epistemological problem][117].[\[12\]][118] A similar view, termed __Platonized naturalism__, was later defended by the [Stanford–Edmonton School][119]: according to this view, a more traditional kind of Platonism is consistent with [naturalism][120]; the more traditional kind of Platonism they defend is distinguished by general principles that assert the existence of [abstract objects][121].[\[13\]][122]

### Mathematicism\[[edit][123]\]

[Max Tegmark][124]'s [mathematical universe hypothesis][125] (or [mathematicism][126]) goes further than Platonism in asserting that not only do all mathematical objects exist, but nothing else does. Tegmark's sole postulate is: *All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically*. That is, in the sense that "in those \[worlds\] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures \[they\] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".[\[14\]][127][\[15\]][128]

### Logicism\[[edit][129]\]

[Logicism][130] is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic.[\[16\]][131]: 41  Logicists hold that mathematics can be known *a priori*, but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus [analytic][132], not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, [logic][133] is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary [logical truths][134].

[Rudolf Carnap][135] (1931) presents the logicist thesis in two parts:[\[16\]][136]

1.  The *concepts* of mathematics can be derived from logical concepts through explicit definitions.
2.  The *theorems* of mathematics can be derived from logical axioms through purely logical deduction.

[Gottlob Frege][137] was the founder of logicism. In his seminal *Die Grundgesetze der Arithmetik* (*Basic Laws of Arithmetic*) he built up [arithmetic][138] from a system of logic with a general principle of comprehension, which he called "Basic Law V" (for concepts *F* and *G*, the extension of *F* equals the extension of *G* if and only if for all objects *a*, *Fa* equals *Ga*), a principle that he took to be acceptable as part of logic.

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Bertrand_Russell_1957.jpg/250px-Bertrand_Russell_1957.jpg)][139]

Frege's construction was flawed. [Bertrand Russell][140] discovered that Basic Law V is inconsistent (this is [Russell's paradox][141]). Frege abandoned his logicist program soon after this, but it was continued by Russell and [Whitehead][142]. They attributed the paradox to "vicious circularity" and built up what they called [ramified type theory][143] to deal with it. In this system, they were eventually able to build up much of modern mathematics but in an altered, and excessively complex form (for example, there were different natural numbers in each type, and there were infinitely many types). They also had to make several compromises in order to develop so much of mathematics, such as an "[axiom of reducibility][144]". Even Russell said that this axiom did not really belong to logic.

Modern logicists (like [Bob Hale][145], [Crispin Wright][146], and perhaps others) have returned to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as [Hume's principle][147] (the number of objects falling under the concept *F* equals the number of objects falling under the concept *G* if and only if the extension of *F* and the extension of *G* can be put into [one-to-one correspondence][148]). Frege required Basic Law V to be able to give an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.

### Formalism\[[edit][149]\]

Formalism holds that mathematical statements may be thought of as statements about the consequences of certain string manipulation rules. For example, in the "game" of [Euclidean geometry][150] (which is seen as consisting of some strings called "axioms", and some "rules of inference" to generate new strings from given ones), one can prove that the [Pythagorean theorem][151] holds (that is, one can generate the string corresponding to the Pythagorean theorem). According to formalism, mathematical truths are not about numbers and sets and triangles and the like—in fact, they are not "about" anything at all.

Another version of formalism is often known as [deductivism][152]. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth, but a relative one: *if* one assigns meaning to the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), *then* one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to [structuralism][153].) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/79/Hilbert.jpg/250px-Hilbert.jpg)][154]

A major early proponent of formalism was [David Hilbert][155], whose [program][156] was intended to be a [complete][157] and [consistent][158] axiomatization of all of mathematics.[\[17\]][159] Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the "finitary arithmetic" (a subsystem of the usual [arithmetic][160] of the positive [integers][161], chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. Hilbert's goals of creating a system of mathematics that is both complete and consistent were seriously undermined by the second of [Gödel's incompleteness theorems][162], which states that sufficiently expressive consistent axiom systems can never prove their own consistency. Since any such axiom system would contain the finitary arithmetic as a subsystem, Gödel's theorem implied that it would be impossible to prove the system's consistency relative to that (since it would then prove its own consistency, which Gödel had shown was impossible). Thus, in order to show that any [axiomatic system][163] of mathematics is in fact consistent, one needs to first assume the consistency of a system of mathematics that is in a sense stronger than the system to be proven consistent.

Hilbert was initially a deductivist, but, as may be clear from above, he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a realist with respect to the finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.

Other formalists, such as [Rudolf Carnap][164], [Alfred Tarski][165], and [Haskell Curry][166], considered mathematics to be the investigation of [formal axiom systems][167]. [Mathematical logicians][168] study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists.

Formalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic, non-standard number systems, new set theories etc. The more games we study, the better. However, in all three of these examples, motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns. The "games" are usually not arbitrary.

The main critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent on the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.

Recently, some\[*[who?][169]*\] formalist mathematicians have proposed that all of our *formal* mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in [computer-readable][170] formats, so as to facilitate [automated proof checking][171] of mathematical proofs and the use of [interactive theorem proving][172] in the development of mathematical theories and computer software. Because of their close connection with [computer science][173], this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the "computability" tradition—see [QED project][174] for a general overview.

### Conventionalism\[[edit][175]\]

The French [mathematician][176] [Henri Poincaré][177] was among the first to articulate a [conventionalist][178] view. Poincaré's use of [non-Euclidean geometries][179] in his work on [differential equations][180] convinced him that [Euclidean geometry][181] should not be regarded as *a priori* truth. He held that [axioms][182] in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with human intuitions about the physical world.

### Intuitionism\[[edit][183]\]

In mathematics, intuitionism is a program of methodological reform whose motto is that "there are no non-experienced mathematical truths" ([L. E. J. Brouwer][184]). From this springboard, intuitionists seek to reconstruct what they consider to be the corrigible portion of mathematics in accordance with Kantian concepts of being, becoming, intuition, and knowledge. Brouwer, the founder of the movement, held that mathematical objects arise from the *a priori* forms of the volitions that inform the perception of empirical objects.[\[18\]][185]

A major force behind intuitionism was [L. E. J. Brouwer][186], who rejected the usefulness of formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student [Arend Heyting][187] postulated an [intuitionistic logic][188], different from the classical [Aristotelian logic][189]; this logic does not contain the [law of the excluded middle][190] and therefore frowns upon [proofs by contradiction][191]. The [axiom of choice][192] is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted.

In intuitionism, the term "explicit construction" is not cleanly defined, and that has led to criticisms. Attempts have been made to use the concepts of [Turing machine][193] or [computable function][194] to fill this gap, leading to the claim that only questions regarding the behavior of finite [algorithms][195] are meaningful and should be investigated in mathematics. This has led to the study of the [computable numbers][196], first introduced by [Alan Turing][197]. Not surprisingly, then, this approach to mathematics is sometimes associated with theoretical [computer science][198].

#### Constructivism\[[edit][199]\]

Like intuitionism, constructivism involves the regulative principle that only mathematical entities which can be explicitly constructed in a certain sense should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction. Important work was done by [Errett Bishop][200], who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in [real analysis][201] as [constructive analysis][202] in his 1967 *Foundations of Constructive Analysis.* [\[19\]][203]

#### Finitism\[[edit][204]\]

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Leopold_Kronecker_%28ca._1880%29.jpg/250px-Leopold_Kronecker_%28ca._1880%29.jpg)][205]

[Finitism][206] is an extreme form of [constructivism][207], according to which a mathematical object does not exist unless it can be constructed from [natural numbers][208] in a [finite][209] number of steps. In her book *Philosophy of Set Theory*, [Mary Tiles][210] characterized those who allow [countably infinite][211] objects as classical finitists, and those who deny even countably infinite objects as strict finitists.

The most famous proponent of finitism was [Leopold Kronecker][212],[\[20\]][213] who said:

> God created the natural numbers, all else is the work of man.

[Ultrafinitism][214] is an even more extreme version of finitism, which rejects not only infinities but finite quantities that cannot feasibly be constructed with available resources. Another variant of finitism is Euclidean arithmetic, a system developed by [John Penn Mayberry][215] in his book *The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets*.[\[21\]][216] Mayberry's system is Aristotelian in general inspiration and, despite his strong rejection of any role for operationalism or feasibility in the foundations of mathematics, comes to somewhat similar conclusions, such as, for instance, that super-exponentiation is not a legitimate finitary function.

### Structuralism\[[edit][217]\]

[Structuralism][218] is a position holding that mathematical theories describe structures, and that mathematical objects are exhaustively defined by their *places* in such structures, consequently having no [intrinsic properties][219]. For instance, it would maintain that all that needs to be known about the number 1 is that it is the first whole number after 0. Likewise all the other whole numbers are defined by their places in a structure, the [number line][220]. Other examples of mathematical objects might include [lines][221] and [planes][222] in geometry, or elements and operations in [abstract algebra][223].

Structuralism is an [epistemologically][224] [realistic][225] view in that it holds that mathematical statements have an objective truth value. However, its central claim only relates to what *kind* of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of *existence* mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their [ontology][226]). The kind of existence mathematical objects have would clearly be dependent on that of the structures in which they are embedded; different sub-varieties of structuralism make different ontological claims in this regard.[\[22\]][227]

The *ante rem* structuralism ("before the thing") has a similar ontology to [Platonism][228]. Structures are held to have a real but abstract and immaterial existence. As such, it faces the standard epistemological problem of explaining the interaction between such abstract structures and flesh-and-blood mathematicians (see [Benacerraf's identification problem][229]).

The *in re* structuralism ("in the thing") is the equivalent of [Aristotelean realism][230]. Structures are held to exist inasmuch as some concrete system exemplifies them. This incurs the usual issues that some perfectly legitimate structures might accidentally happen not to exist, and that a finite physical world might not be "big" enough to accommodate some otherwise legitimate structures.

The *post rem* structuralism ("after the thing") is [anti-realist][231] about structures in a way that parallels [nominalism][232]. Like nominalism, the *post rem* approach denies the existence of abstract mathematical objects with properties other than their place in a relational structure. According to this view mathematical *systems* exist, and have structural features in common. If something is true of a structure, it will be true of all systems exemplifying the structure. However, it is merely instrumental to talk of structures being "held in common" between systems: they in fact have no independent existence.

### Embodied mind theories\[[edit][233]\]

[Embodied mind][234] theories hold that mathematical thought is a natural outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which finds itself in our physical universe. For example, the abstract concept of [number][235] springs from the experience of counting discrete objects. It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.

With this view, the physical universe can thus be seen as the ultimate foundation of mathematics: it guided the evolution of the brain and later determined which questions this brain would find worthy of investigation. However, the human mind has no special claim on reality or approaches to it built out of math. If such constructs as [Euler's identity][236] are true then they are true as a map of the human mind and [cognition][237].

Embodied mind theorists thus explain the effectiveness of mathematics—mathematics was constructed by the brain in order to be effective in this universe.

The most accessible, famous, and infamous treatment of this perspective is *[Where Mathematics Comes From][238]*, by [George Lakoff][239] and [Rafael E. Núñez][240]. In addition, mathematician [Keith Devlin][241] has investigated similar concepts with his book *[The Math Instinct][242]*, as has neuroscientist [Stanislas Dehaene][243] with his book *The Number Sense*. For more on the philosophical ideas that inspired this perspective, see [cognitive science of mathematics][244].

#### Aristotelian realism\[[edit][245]\]

Aristotelian realism holds that mathematics studies properties such as symmetry, continuity and order that can be literally realized in the physical world (or in any other world there might be). It contrasts with Platonism in holding that the objects of mathematics, such as numbers, do not exist in an "abstract" world but can be physically realized. For example, the number 4 is realized in the relation between a heap of parrots and the universal "being a parrot" that divides the heap into so many parrots.[\[23\]][246] Aristotelian realism is defended by [James Franklin][247] and the [Sydney School][248] in the philosophy of mathematics and is close to the view of [Penelope Maddy][249] that when an egg carton is opened, a set of three eggs is perceived (that is, a mathematical entity realized in the physical world).[\[24\]][250] A problem for Aristotelian realism is what account to give of higher infinities, which may not be realizable in the physical world.

The Euclidean arithmetic developed by [John Penn Mayberry][251] in his book *The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets*[\[21\]][252] also falls into the Aristotelian realist tradition. Mayberry, following Euclid, considers numbers to be simply "definite multitudes of units" realized in nature—such as "the members of the London Symphony Orchestra" or "the trees in Birnam wood". Whether or not there are definite multitudes of units for which Euclid's Common Notion 5 (the whole is greater than the part) fails and which would consequently be reckoned as infinite is for Mayberry essentially a question about Nature and does not entail any transcendental suppositions.

#### Psychologism\[[edit][253]\]

[Psychologism][254] in the philosophy of mathematics is the position that [mathematical][255] [concepts][256] and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts (or laws).

[John Stuart Mill][257] seems to have been an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, as were many 19th-century German logicians such as [Sigwart][258] and [Erdmann][259] as well as a number of [psychologists][260], past and present: for example, [Gustave Le Bon][261]. Psychologism was famously criticized by [Frege][262] in his *[The Foundations of Arithmetic][263]*, and many of his works and essays, including his review of [Husserl][264]'s *[Philosophy of Arithmetic][265]*. Edmund Husserl, in the first volume of his *[Logical Investigations][266]*, called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. The "Prolegomena" is considered a more concise, fair, and thorough refutation of psychologism than the criticisms made by Frege, and also it is considered today by many as being a memorable refutation for its decisive blow to psychologism. Psychologism was also criticized by [Charles Sanders Peirce][267] and [Maurice Merleau-Ponty][268].

#### Empiricism\[[edit][269]\]

[Mathematical empiricism][270] is a form of realism that denies that mathematics can be known *a priori* at all. It says that we discover mathematical facts by [empirical research][271], just like facts in any of the other sciences. It is not one of the classical three positions advocated in the early 20th century, but primarily arose in the middle of the century. However, an important early proponent of a view like this was [John Stuart Mill][272]. Mill's view was widely criticized, because, according to critics, such as A.J. Ayer,[\[25\]][273] it makes statements like "2 + 2 = 4" come out as uncertain, contingent truths, which we can only learn by observing instances of two pairs coming together and forming a quartet.

Contemporary mathematical empiricism, formulated by [W. V. O. Quine][274] and [Hilary Putnam][275], is primarily supported by the [indispensability argument][276]: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and if we want to believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about [electrons][277] to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must [exist][278]. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.

Putnam strongly rejected the term "[Platonist][279]" as implying an over-specific [ontology][280] that was not necessary to [mathematical practice][281] in any real sense. He advocated a form of "pure realism" that rejected mystical notions of [truth][282] and accepted much [quasi-empiricism in mathematics][283]. This grew from the increasingly popular assertion in the late 20th century that no one [foundation of mathematics][284] could be ever proven to exist. It is also sometimes called "postmodernism in mathematics" although that term is considered overloaded by some and insulting by others. Quasi-empiricism argues that in doing their research, mathematicians test hypotheses as well as prove theorems. A mathematical argument can transmit falsity from the conclusion to the premises just as well as it can transmit truth from the premises to the conclusion. Putnam has argued that any theory of mathematical realism would include quasi-empirical methods. He proposed that an alien species doing mathematics might well rely on quasi-empirical methods primarily, being willing often to forgo rigorous and axiomatic proofs, and still be doing mathematics—at perhaps a somewhat greater risk of failure of their calculations. He gave a detailed argument for this in *New Directions*.[\[26\]][285] Quasi-empiricism was also developed by [Imre Lakatos][286].

The most important criticism of empirical views of mathematics is approximately the same as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the [empirical justification][287] comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. [consilience][288] after [E.O. Wilson][289]. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is extraordinarily central, and that it would be extremely difficult for us to revise it, though not impossible.

For a philosophy of mathematics that attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of Quine and Gödel's approaches by taking aspects of each see [Penelope Maddy][290]'s *Realism in Mathematics*. Another example of a realist theory is the [embodied mind theory][291].

For experimental evidence suggesting that human infants can do elementary arithmetic, see [Brian Butterworth][292].

### Fictionalism\[[edit][293]\]

__Mathematical fictionalism__ was brought to fame in 1980 when [Hartry Field][294] published *Science Without Numbers*,[\[27\]][295] which rejected and in fact reversed Quine's indispensability argument. Where Quine suggested that mathematics was indispensable for our best scientific theories, and therefore should be accepted as a body of truths talking about independently existing entities, Field suggested that mathematics was dispensable, and therefore should be considered as a body of falsehoods not talking about anything real. He did this by giving a complete axiomatization of [Newtonian mechanics][296] with no reference to numbers or functions at all. He started with the "betweenness" of [Hilbert's axioms][297] to characterize space without coordinatizing it, and then added extra relations between points to do the work formerly done by [vector fields][298]. Hilbert's geometry is mathematical, because it talks about abstract points, but in Field's theory, these points are the concrete points of physical space, so no special mathematical objects at all are needed.

Having shown how to do science without using numbers, Field proceeded to rehabilitate mathematics as a kind of [useful fiction][299]. He showed that mathematical physics is a [conservative extension][300] of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every physical fact provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field's system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, talking as if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like "2 + 2 = 4" is just as fictitious as "[Sherlock Holmes][301] lived at 221B Baker Street"—but both are true according to the relevant fictions.

By this account, there are no metaphysical or epistemological problems special to mathematics. The only worries left are the general worries about non-mathematical physics, and about [fiction][302] in general. Field's approach has been very influential, but is widely rejected. This is in part because of the requirement of strong fragments of [second-order logic][303] to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require [quantification][304] over abstract models or deductions.

### \[[edit][305]\]

[Social constructivism][306] sees mathematics primarily as a [social construct][307], as a product of culture, subject to correction and change. Like the other sciences, mathematics is viewed as an empirical endeavor whose results are constantly evaluated and may be discarded. However, while on an empiricist view the evaluation is some sort of comparison with "reality", social constructivists emphasize that the direction of mathematical research is dictated by the fashions of the social group performing it or by the needs of the society financing it. However, although such external forces may change the direction of some mathematical research, there are strong internal constraints—the mathematical traditions, methods, problems, meanings and values into which mathematicians are enculturated—that work to conserve the historically-defined discipline.

This runs counter to the traditional beliefs of working mathematicians, that mathematics is somehow pure or objective. But social constructivists argue that mathematics is in fact grounded by much uncertainty: as [mathematical practice][308] evolves, the status of previous mathematics is cast into doubt, and is corrected to the degree it is required or desired by the current mathematical community. This can be seen in the development of analysis from reexamination of the calculus of Leibniz and Newton. They argue further that finished mathematics is often accorded too much status, and [folk mathematics][309] not enough, due to an overemphasis on axiomatic proof and peer review as practices.

The social nature of mathematics is highlighted in its [subcultures][310]. Major discoveries can be made in one branch of mathematics and be relevant to another, yet the relationship goes undiscovered for lack of social contact between mathematicians. Social constructivists argue each speciality forms its own [epistemic community][311] and often has great difficulty communicating, or motivating the investigation of [unifying conjectures][312] that might relate different areas of mathematics. Social constructivists see the process of "doing mathematics" as actually creating the meaning, while social realists see a deficiency either of human capacity to abstractify, or of human's [cognitive bias][313], or of mathematicians' [collective intelligence][314] as preventing the comprehension of a real universe of mathematical objects. Social constructivists sometimes reject the search for foundations of mathematics as bound to fail, as pointless or even meaningless.

Contributions to this school have been made by [Imre Lakatos][315] and [Thomas Tymoczko][316], although it is not clear that either would endorse the title.\[*[clarification needed][317]*\] More recently [Paul Ernest][318] has explicitly formulated a social constructivist philosophy of mathematics.[\[28\]][319] Some consider the work of [Paul Erdős][320] as a whole to have advanced this view (although he personally rejected it) because of his uniquely broad collaborations, which prompted others to see and study "mathematics as a social activity", e.g., via the [Erdős number][321]. [Reuben Hersh][322] has also promoted the social view of mathematics, calling it a "humanistic" approach,[\[29\]][323] similar to but not quite the same as that associated with Alvin White;[\[30\]][324] one of Hersh's co-authors, [Philip J. Davis][325], has expressed sympathy for the social view as well.

### Beyond the traditional schools\[[edit][326]\]

#### Unreasonable effectiveness\[[edit][327]\]

Rather than focus on narrow debates about the true nature of mathematical [truth][328], or even on practices unique to mathematicians such as the [proof][329], a growing movement from the 1960s to the 1990s began to question the idea of seeking foundations or finding any one right answer to why mathematics works. The starting point for this was [Eugene Wigner][330]'s famous 1960 paper "[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences][331]", in which he argued that the happy coincidence of mathematics and physics being so well matched seemed to be unreasonable and hard to explain.

#### Popper's two senses of number statements\[[edit][332]\]

Realist and constructivist theories are normally taken to be contraries. However, [Karl Popper][333][\[31\]][334] argued that a number statement such as "2 apples + 2 apples = 4 apples" can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and logically true. In the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable. Another way of putting this is to say that a single number statement can express two propositions: one of which can be explained on constructivist lines; the other on realist lines.[\[32\]][335]

#### Philosophy of language\[[edit][336]\]

Innovations in the philosophy of language during the 20th century renewed interest in whether mathematics is, as is often said, the *language* of science. Although some mathematicians and philosophers would accept the statement "[mathematics is a language][337]", linguists believe that the implications of such a statement must be considered. For example, the tools of [linguistics][338] are not generally applied to the symbol systems of mathematics, that is, mathematics is studied in a markedly different way from other languages. If mathematics is a language, it is a different type of language from [natural languages][339]. Indeed, because of the need for clarity and specificity, the language of mathematics is far more constrained than natural languages studied by linguists. However, the methods developed by Frege and Tarski for the study of mathematical language have been extended greatly by Tarski's student [Richard Montague][340] and other linguists working in [formal semantics][341] to show that the distinction between mathematical language and natural language may not be as great as it seems.

Mohan Ganesalingam has analysed mathematical language using tools from formal linguistics.[\[33\]][342] Ganesalingam notes that some features of natural language are not necessary when analysing mathematical language (such as [tense][343]), but many of the same analytical tools can be used (such as [context-free grammars][344]). One important difference is that mathematical objects have clearly defined [types][345], which can be explicitly defined in a text: "Effectively, we are allowed to introduce a word in one part of a sentence, and declare its [part of speech][346] in another; and this operation has no analogue in natural language."[\[33\]][347]: 251 

## Arguments\[[edit][348]\]

### Indispensability argument for realism\[[edit][349]\]

This argument, associated with [Willard Quine][350] and [Hilary Putnam][351], is considered by [Stephen Yablo][352] to be one of the most challenging arguments in favor of the acceptance of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets.[\[34\]][353] The form of the argument is as follows.

1.  One must have [ontological][354] commitments to *all* entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities *only* (commonly referred to as "all and only").
2.  Mathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,
3.  One must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities.[\[35\]][355]

The justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke [naturalism][356] to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the "only" part of "all and only". The assertion that "all" entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by [confirmation holism][357]. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the [nominalist][358] who wishes to exclude the existence of [sets][359] and [non-Euclidean geometry][360], but to include the existence of [quarks][361] and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.[\[35\]][362]

### Epistemic argument against realism\[[edit][363]\]

The [anti-realist][364] "[epistemic][365] argument" against Platonism has been made by [Paul Benacerraf][366] and [Hartry Field][367]. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are *[abstract][368]* entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact [causally][369] with concrete, physical entities ("the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving Platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time"[\[36\]][370]). Whilst our knowledge of concrete, physical objects is based on our ability to [perceive][371] them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.[\[37\]][372][\[38\]][373][\[39\]][374] Another way of making the point is that if the Platonic world were to disappear, it would make no difference to the ability of mathematicians to generate [proofs][375], etc., which is already fully accountable in terms of physical processes in their brains.

Field developed his views into [fictionalism][376]. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of [mathematical structuralism][377], according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

The argument hinges on the idea that a satisfactory [naturalistic][378] account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special [intuition][379] that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by [Sir Roger Penrose][380].[\[40\]][381]

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non-causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by [Jerrold Katz][382] in his 2000 book *[Realistic Rationalism][383]*.

A more radical defense is denial of physical reality, i.e. the [mathematical universe hypothesis][384]. In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.

## Aesthetics\[[edit][385]\]

Many practicing mathematicians have been drawn to their subject because of a sense of [beauty][386] they perceive in it. One sometimes hears the sentiment that mathematicians would like to leave philosophy to the philosophers and get back to mathematics—where, presumably, the beauty lies.

In his work on the [divine proportion][387], H.E. Huntley relates the feeling of reading and understanding someone else's proof of a theorem of mathematics to that of a viewer of a masterpiece of art—the reader of a proof has a similar sense of exhilaration at understanding as the original author of the proof, much as, he argues, the viewer of a masterpiece has a sense of exhilaration similar to the original painter or sculptor. Indeed, one can study mathematical and scientific writings as [literature][388].

[Philip J. Davis][389] and [Reuben Hersh][390] have commented that the sense of mathematical beauty is universal amongst practicing mathematicians. By way of example, they provide two proofs of the irrationality of [√2][391]. The first is the traditional proof by [contradiction][392], ascribed to [Euclid][393]; the second is a more direct proof involving the [fundamental theorem of arithmetic][394] that, they argue, gets to the heart of the issue. Davis and Hersh argue that mathematicians find the second proof more aesthetically appealing because it gets closer to the nature of the problem.

[Paul Erdős][395] was well known for his notion of a hypothetical "Book" containing the most elegant or beautiful mathematical proofs. There is not universal agreement that a result has one "most elegant" proof; [Gregory Chaitin][396] has argued against this idea.

Philosophers have sometimes criticized mathematicians' sense of beauty or elegance as being, at best, vaguely stated. By the same token, however, philosophers of mathematics have sought to characterize what makes one proof more desirable than another when both are logically sound.

Another aspect of aesthetics concerning mathematics is mathematicians' views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition of this view occurs in [G. H. Hardy][397]'s book *[A Mathematician's Apology][398]*, in which Hardy argues that pure mathematics is superior in beauty to [applied mathematics][399] precisely because it cannot be used for war and similar ends.
