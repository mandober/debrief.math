# Predicates

*Predication* is the act of basing or establishing something (statement, action) on another thing ("I predicated my argument on the facts"), or stating something as an attribute of a thing ("The lecture predicated the perfectibility of humankind"). To predicate means to carry the connotation of, to imply, state, assert, declar, proclaim.

In grammar of natural languages, *subject* and *predicate* are the two main constituents of sentences or clauses. A predicate modifies the subject and consists of a verb and phrases governed by the verb, including even the object, whose existence is predicated by the type of the verb in the predicate (e.g. whether it is transitive and thus requires an object). For example, in the sentence "She opened the door", the predicate is "opened the door" (i.e. it includes the object "door"); In "He is very sleepy", the predicate is "is very sleepy", which is the adverbial phase.

In logic, *predication* is the act of making an expression the predicate of a proposition. We normally consider the entire *propositional statement* as having a true value, but really, it is the *predicate* that is the part of a proposition that can be affirmed or denied about the subject.

A predicate is obtained from a proposition by removing the subject.

In the proposition "Socrates is mortal", the predicate is "is mortal" or just "mortal".

In symbolic logic, predicates are represented by a single, usually capital, letter (e.g. `M` for mortal).






A property, characteristic, or attribute that may be affirmed or denied of something. The categorial statement "all men are mortal" relates two predicates, "is a man" and "is mortal".

The term of a categorial proposition that is affirmed or denied of its subject. In this example "all men" is the subject, and "mortal" is the predicate.

A function from individuals to truth values, the truth set of the function being the extension of the predicate.


## Predicates and relations

In general, a predicate is a property of an n-tuple of objects. Predicates are `n`-ary relations.

A predicate can always be considered as an n-place *relation*, and it is especially referred to as a relation in case the predicate is *polyadic* (when `n > 1`).

In case `n = 2`, it is called a binary relation (e.g. "A is the son of B"). When `n = 3`, it is a ternary relation (e.g. "A gave B to C", "A is between B and C").

In the special case when `n = 1`, i.e. in the case of unary (1-place) predicate (e.g. "X is mortal", "X is blue"), it is also called a *property*, and it is then a property of an individual object.

The extreme case when `n = 0` (*nullary relation*) brings the predicativity itself in question. In such a case it may be considered as a *constant* - an individual object itself, similarly to how 'true' and 'false' are logical constants, but are sometimes treated as nullary logical functions (logical connectives).
