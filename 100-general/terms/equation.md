# Equation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation

In mathematics, an equation is a formula that expresses the equality of two expressions, by relating them with the equals sign.


An equation is a problem of finding values of some variables, called unknowns, for which the specified equality is true. The term "equation" may also refer to an equality relation that is satisfied only for the values of the variables that one is interested in. For example, `x² + y² = 1` is the equation of the unit circle.

There is no standard notation that distinguishes an equation from an identity, or other use of the *equality relation*: one has to guess an appropriate interpretation from the semantics of expressions and the context.

An identity is asserted to be true for all values of variables in a given domain.

An "equation" may sometimes mean an identity, but more often than not, it specifies a subset of the variable space to be the subset where the equation is true.
