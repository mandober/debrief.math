## Nature of mathematics

* Definitions of mathematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_mathematics
Definitions of mathematics - Mathematics has no generally accepted definition; different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.

* Language of mathematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_of_mathematics
Language of mathematics is the system used by mathematicians to communicate mathematical ideas among themselves, and is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity.

* Philosophy of mathematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics
Philosophy of mathematics - its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.

- Classical mathematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mathematics
Classical mathematics refers generally to the mainstream approach to mathematics, which is based on classical logic and ZFC set theory.

- Constructive mathematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)
Constructive mathematics asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a mathematical object to prove that it exists. In classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption.

- Predicative mathematics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impredicativity
In mathematics, logic and philosophy of mathematics, something that is impredicative is a self-referencing definition.


## About Mathematics

* Mathematics as a *academic discipline* - branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_discipline

* Mathematics as a *formal science* - branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.

## Mathematical Concepts

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_concept

* Mathematical object
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object
an abstract concept in mathematics; an object is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Each branch of mathematics has its own objects.

* Mathematical structure
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure
a set endowed with some additional features on the set (e.g., operation, relation, metric, topology). A partial list of possible structures are measures, algebraic structures (groups, fields, etc.), topologies, metric structures (geometries), orders, events, equivalence relations, differential structures, and categories.

* Algebraic structures
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structure

* Equivalent definitions of mathematical structures
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_definitions_of_mathematical_structures

* Abstraction
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(mathematics)
the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.

* Generalization
