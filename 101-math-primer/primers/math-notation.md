# Mathematical notation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_notation

Mathematical notation is a system of symbolic representations of mathematical objects and ideas. Mathematical notations are used in mathematics, the physical sciences, engineering, and economics. Mathematical notations include relatively simple symbolic representations, such as the numbers 0, 1 and 2; function symbols such as sin; operator symbols such as "+"; conceptual symbols such as lim and dy/dx; equations and variables; and complex diagrammatic notations such as Penrose graphical notation and Coxeterâ€“Dynkin diagrams.


Implication:
- $$n \in \mathbb{N} \to S(n)\in \mathbb{N}$$    
- IF n is a natural number THEN the successor of n is a natural number.
