# Functional

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)

In mathematics, the term functional (noun) has at least 3 meanings:

1. In modern linear algebra, it refers to a linear mapping from a vector space V into its field of scalars, i.e. it refers to an element of the dual space Vâˆ—

2. In mathematical analysis, more generally and historically, it refers to a mapping from a space X into the real numbers, or sometimes into the complex numbers, for the purpose of establishing a calculus-like structure on X. Depending on the author, such mappings may or may not be assumed to be linear, or to be defined on the whole space X.

3. In CS, the term "functional" is a synonym for higher-order function.
