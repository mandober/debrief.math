# Abstraction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(mathematics)

**Abstraction** is the process in which the previously studied and well-understood details (of the studied object or concept) are going through the deliberate simplification as the process of understanding moves from the lower to higher levels, from particularity toward totality.

**Abstraction in mathematics** is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns and properties of a *mathematical concept*, extracting its essence while removing any dependencies it might had with the real world objects.

and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena. Two of the most highly abstract areas of modern mathematics are *category theory* and *model theory*.






In math, **abstraction** is the process of extracting the underlying *essence* of a *mathematical concept* (by removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected) and *generalizing* it so that it has wider applications among other abstract descriptions and phenomena.

> In philosophy, **essence** is the property that makes an entity what it fundamentally is, which it has by necessity, without which it loses its identity. Essence is contrasted with **accident** - a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity.

"I've sure loved playing with them toy trucks but I've preferred analyzing them into bits and pieces in search form their essence. The accompanying phase, the synthesis, wasn't even an afterthought" -- Nesaac Iwton

Major abstractions:
- Zero
- Hindu-Arabic numerals
- Positional numeral system
- Arithmetic operations: 1 + 3 - 2 ⨯ 4 ÷ 2
- Basic algebra has abstracted numbers: a + b - c ⨯ d ÷ c
- Abstract algebra has abstracted operations: a 🚌 b 🚏 c 🐀 d 👜 c
- Functions


sets -> structures -> groups, filed, ring -> categories
