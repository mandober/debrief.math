# Introduction to functions

A **function** is         (*what?*)    
a relation between sets     
that associates           (*what?*)    
to every element 
of the first set      (*what?*)    
exactly one element      
of the second set.    (*ah-huh*)


Historically, functions were representations of how a varying quantity depends on another; e.g. the position of a planet is a function of time. At the end of XVII century, with the introduction of *calculus*, the concept of functions was further developed, but it was not until XIX century that concept grew beyond *differentiable functions*. i.e. functions with high degree of regularity. At the end of the XIX century, with the introduction of sets, the concept of function was formalized in terms of set theory.



Typical examples are functions from integers to integers or from the real numbers to real numbers.





A function is a process or a relation that associates each element x of a set X, the domain of the function, to a single element y of another set Y (possibly the same set), the codomain of the function. If the function is called f, this relation is denoted y = f (x) (read f of x), the element x is the argument or input of the function, and y is the value of the function, the output, or the image of x by f.[2] The symbol that is used for representing the input is the variable of the function (one often says that f is a function of the variable x).

A function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs (x, f (x)), called the graph of the function.[3] When the domain and the codomain are sets of numbers, each such pair may be considered as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane. In general, these points form a curve, which is also called the graph of the function. This is a useful representation of the function, which is commonly used everywhere.

Functions are widely used in science, and in most fields of mathematics. Their role is so important that it has been said that they are "the central objects of investigation" in most fields of mathematics.[4]
