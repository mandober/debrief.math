- Representation of a Set


In set theory we will learn about representation in roster form and set builder form , types of sets (Empty set, singleton set, finite and infinite sets, equal and equivalent sets), cardinal number of a set, subsets (Proper subset, super set, power set), number of proper subsets, universal set, operation on sets (Union, intersection, difference and complement of sets).
