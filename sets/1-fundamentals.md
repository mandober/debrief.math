# Set Fundamentals

- set
- set element
- set inclusion
- set membership


Sets were introduced by the German mathematician **Georg Cantor** at the end of the XIX century: _"A set is a gathering into a whole of definite distinct objects of our perception or thought, called the elements of the set."_ (loose translation, [^1])

Loosely, a set is a container and an object in its own right; it is a collection of discrete and finite objects; an object contained in a set is called a **set member** or a **set element**.

## Set is a primitive
Set is primitive mathematical notion - it is not defined in terms of any previously defined concepts. It escapes any attempt to formally define it, so it must be taken for granted, usually by appealing to one's intuition.

The *empty set* is also a primitive notion. To state that it exists would require an implicit axiom.

## Fundamental set properties
The most fundamental properties of a set are in terms of ordering and uniqueness: elements in a set are **unordered** (their order is immaterial), and the elements are **unique** (multiple instances of the same element are treated as a single object)[^2].

Sets can contain anything, but since we're concerned with math here, sets will contain well-defined mathematical objects. Being well-defined should enforce the requirement that only unambiguously defined candidates are to be accepted into a set.





[^1]: _"Unter einer **Menge** verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung *M* von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten *m* unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die **Elemente** von *M* genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen."_   
By a Set we mean any collection M of certain well-differentiated Objects of our Intuition or our Thinking (which are named the Elements of M) into a Whole.

[^2]: As for the ordering, the situation is pretty clear, but concerning the uniqueness of elements, it is less clear as to whether any element can freely spawn duplicates of itself as needed, or whether any duplicates emerging from the set operations are immediately collapsed. (To be investigated later with the introduction of order pairs)
