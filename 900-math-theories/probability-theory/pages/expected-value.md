# Expected value

Expected value
- expectation
- mathematical expectation
- first moment
- mean
- average
is the sum of the probabilities of each possible outcome of an experiment multiplied by their corresponding payoff or "value".

Thus, it represents the average amount, one "expects" to win per bet if bets with identical odds are repeated many times.

For example, the expected value of rolling a die is 3.5 (the sum of all values from 1 to 6, divided by 6: 21 รท 6 = 3.5).

The concept is, intuitively, a generalization of the weighted average of all possible outcomes of a particular procedure or experiment, and can be viewed as the *arithmetic mean* of a large number of independent realizations of the experiment.

The expected value of random variable `X` is typically written as `E(X)` for the expectation operator, and `ฮผ` for the parameter.
