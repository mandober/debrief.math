# Probability Theory :: Index :: Probability Interpretations

1. Physical probability, Objective probability, Frequency probability
  - Frequentist approach (Venn, Reichenbach and von Mises)
  - Propensity approach (Popper, Miller, Giere and Fetzer)
2. Evidential probability, Bayesian probability
  - Classical interpretation (Laplace)
  - Subjective interpretation (de Finetti and Savage)
  - Epistemic or inductive interpretation (Ramsey, Cox)
  - Logical interpretation (Keynes and Carnap)
  - Probability covering groups, "intersubjective" (Gillies and Rowbottom)

## By approach

A summary of some interpretations of probability:

- Classical
  - Main hypothesis:      Principle of indifference
  - Conceptual basis:     Hypothetical symmetry
  - Conceptual approach:  Conjectural
  - Single case possible: Yes
  - Precise:              Yes
  - Problems:             Ambiguity in principle of indifference
- Frequentist
  - Main hypothesis:      Frequency of occurrence
  - Conceptual basis:     Past data and reference class
  - Conceptual approach:  Empirical
  - Single case possible: No
  - Precise:              No
  - Problems:             Circular definition
- Subjective
  - Main hypothesis:      Degree of belief
  - Conceptual basis:     Knowledge and intuition
  - Conceptual approach:  Subjective
  - Single case possible: Yes
  - Precise:              No
  - Problems:             Reference class problem
- Propensity
  - Main hypothesis:      Degree of causal connection
  - Conceptual basis:     Present state of system
  - Conceptual approach:  Metaphysical
  - Single case possible: Yes
  - Precise:              Yes
  - Problems:             Disputed concept
