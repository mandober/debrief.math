**Scientific computation (SC)**, aka *computational science* or *scientific computing*, is a field in mathematics that uses advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems.

SC is an area of science that spans many disciplines, but at its core involves the development of models and simulations to understand natural systems.

Algorithms (numerical and non-numerical)
- mathematical models
- computational models
- computer simulations

The algorithms are developed to solve scientific (biological, physical, social) problems, as well as the problems in engineering and humanities.

Computer hardware that develops and optimizes the advanced system hardware, firmware, networking, and data management components needed to solve computationally demanding problems.

The computing infrastructure that supports both the science and engineering problem solving and the developmental computer and information science.

In practical use, it is typically the application of computer simulation and other forms of computation from numerical analysis and theoretical computer science to solve problems in various scientific disciplines.

The field is different from theory and laboratory experiments, which are the traditional forms of science and engineering. The scientific computing approach is to gain understanding through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers.

Scientists and engineers develop computer programs and application software that model systems being studied and run these programs with various sets of input parameters.

>The essence of computational science is the application of numerical algorithms and computational mathematics.

In some cases, these models require massive amounts of calculations (usually floating-point) and are often executed on supercomputers or distributed computing platforms.
