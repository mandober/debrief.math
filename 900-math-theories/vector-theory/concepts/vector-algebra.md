**Vector algebra** is a branch of **vector calculus** dealing with the simplest operations involving (free) vectors including
- linear operations of addition of vectors
- multiplication of a vector by a scalar


The sum `a + b` of two vectors `a` and `b` 
is the vector drawn from the origin of `a` to the end of `b`, 
if the end of `a` and the origin of `b` coincide.

## Vector addition

The properties of the addition of vectors:
* commutativity, `a + b = b + a`
* associativity, `(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)`
* existence of a zero-element, `a+0=a`
* existence of an inverse element, `a+(−a)=0`

where
- `0` is the zero vector 
- `−a` is the vector opposite to the vector `a` (its inverse)

The *difference* `a − b` of two vectors `a` and `b`
is the vector `x` for which `x + b = a`.

The *product* `λa` of a vector `a` by a number `λ` is, 
* if `λ ≠ 0`, `a ≠ 0`, a vector whose modulus equals `|λ||a|` 
  and whose direction is
  - if `λ > 0`: the direction of `a`
  - if `λ < 0`: the direction of `-a`
  - if `λ = 0` and `a = 0`, then `λa = 0`

## Vector multiplication

The properties of the multiplication of a vector by a scalar:
* distributivity with respect to vector addition, `λ(a + b) = λa + λb`
* distributivity with respect to addition of numbers, `(λ + μ)a = λa + μa`
* associativity, `λ(μa) = (λμ)a`
* multiplication by one, `1 ⋅ a = a`
