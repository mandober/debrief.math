# Type Theory: Summary


Two type theories that can serve as *the foundations of mathematics*
- _Typed Lambda Calculus_ by Alonzo Church
- _Intuitionistic Type Theory_ by Per Martin-LÃ¶f


- in tt concepts like "and" and "or" can be encoded as types
- terms generally belong to only one type
- when subset is needed, tt creates a new _dependent sum type_ with new terms
- union is similarly achieved by a new sum type and new terms
- types that combine unrelated types do so by creating new terms
