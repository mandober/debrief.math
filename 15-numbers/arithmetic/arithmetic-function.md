# Arithmetic function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_function

In number theory, an **arithmetic function** or **number-theoretic function** is any function $$f(n)$$ whose domain is the positive integers and whose range is a subset of the complex numbers.

$$f: \mathbb{Z^+} \to \mathbb{C}$$

An example of an arithmetic function is the **divisor function** whose value at a positive integer $$n$$ is equal to the number of divisors of $$n$$.

$$divisors(28) = |\{1,2,4,7,14,28\}| = 6$$
