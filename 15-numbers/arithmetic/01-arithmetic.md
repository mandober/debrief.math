# Arithmetic

**Arithmetic** is a branch of math that studies numbers and operations that can be performed on numbers, especially the four traditional basic operations.

Being at the bottom of mathematical abstraction, arithmetic uses concrete numbers (as opposed to variables) because it is more concerned with immediate results of equations, and the exploration of ways to calculate the result more efficiently (whether manually or using a machine).

Besides the 4 basic operations, arithmetic also includes many other operations (exponentiation, roots, logarithms, percentages, etc.).

A mathematical object that supports all 4 basic arithmetic operations, with respect to a set of axioms, is called a *field*.

The word arithmetic comes from the Greek `αριθμητική`, which is a compound of `ἀριθμός` (number) and `τέχνη, -τική` (art, skill, craft).
