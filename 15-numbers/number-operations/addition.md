Addition, denoted by the symbol `+`, along with subtraction, multiplication and division makes the four basic arithmetic operations.

Addition is defined over the fundamental sets of numbers (ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ), but it is also generalized to other mathematical structures, like sets, vectors, matrices, categories, etc..

Potential properties of addition:
- commutative (frequently, but not always)
- associative meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does not matter
- Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting;
- addition of 0 does not change a number.
- Addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication.
