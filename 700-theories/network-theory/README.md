# Network theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory

Network theory is the study of graphs as a representation of either symmetric relations or asymmetric relations between discrete objects.

In computer science and network science, network theory is a part of graph theory: a network can be defined as a graph in which nodes and/or edges have attributes (e.g. names).

Euler's solution of the Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem is considered to be the first true proof in the theory of networks.

Network theory has applications in many disciplines including statistical physics, particle physics, computer science, electrical engineering, biology,economics, finance, operations research, climatology, ecology, public health,sociology and neuroscience.

Applications of network theory include logistical networks, the World Wide Web, Internet, gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks, social networks,epistemological networks, etc.
