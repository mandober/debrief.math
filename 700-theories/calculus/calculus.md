*Differential Calculus* breaks an object into pieces to find how it *changes*. *Integral Calculus* integrates the pieces to find the *quantity*.

differential calculus is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of the rates at which quantities change. It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus, the other being integral calculus, the study of the area beneath a curve.
