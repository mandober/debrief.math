# Boolean algebra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra

* Boolean algebras are models of the equational theory of two values.

* Examples of Boolean algebras: `The algebra of binary digits` under the logical operations (disjunction, conjunction, negation). Applications: propositional calculus, theory of digital circuits. `The algebra of sets` under the set operations (union, intersection, complement).

* All finite Boolean algebras share the same theorems and have a decidable first-order theory.

* Boolean algebra treats the equational theory of the maximal two-element finitary algebra, called the Boolean prototype, and the models of that theory, called Boolean algebras.

* An algebra (or algebraic structure) is a mathematical structure consisting of 3 components: an underlying (or carrier) set, a family of operations on the set, and a set of axioms they together satisfy.
