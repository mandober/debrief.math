# Properties of algebras

- Fundamental properties
  - closure (totality)
  - associativity
  - identity
    - identity element
  - inversion
    - inverse element
    - invertability
    - involution
  - distributivity
  - commutativity

- Common properties
  - idempotence
  - cencellativity
  - absorption
    - Absorption law:
      `a + (a * b) = a`
      `a * (a + b) = a`
      `b'+(a b')=b'`
  - annihilation
    - zero element
  - domination
    - in Boolean algebra
      - a * 0 = 0
      - a + 1 = 1
  - De Morgan's Laws:
    `(a * b)' <=> a' + b'`
    `(a + b)' <=> a' * b'`

- Relational properties
  - reflexivity
  - transitivity
  - symmetry
  - asymmetry
  - antisymmetry
  - dichotomy
  - trichotomy

- Frequent properties
  - homomorphism, `F (f ∘ g) = F f ∘ F g`

- Infrequent properties
  - closure operator
    - in star semiring, closed semiring
      - `a⃰ = 1 + a + a⃰`
  - decomposition
    - in algebraic graphs: `+` (overlay) and `∙` (connect)
    - `xyz = xy + xz + yz`
