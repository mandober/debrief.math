# Free object

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_object

The idea of a free object is one of the basic concepts of abstract algebra. Informally, a free object over a set `A` can be thought of as being a "generic" algebraic structure over `A`: the only equations that hold between elements of the free object are those that follow from the defining axioms of some algebraic structure.

In other words, a free object - particularly, a free algebra - is an algebraic structure that only upholds the defining (i.e. the absolutely necessary) axioms. So, for example, a *pure or free monid* is a monoid that only upholds closure, associativity and identity, and nothing else. Normally, any algebraic structure that upholds these 3 axioms may be considered a monoid; e.g. any group is also a monoid, and a group is a magma and semigroup as well.

Examples of free objects include free monoids, free groups, tensor algebras, free lattices.

The concept of a free object in part belongs to universal algebra, in the sense that it affects all types of algebraic structures (with finitary ops). 
The concept of a free object also has a formulation in terms of category theory (although in yet more abstract terms).
