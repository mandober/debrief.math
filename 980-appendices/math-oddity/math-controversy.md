## Currying

Currying is the transformation of an n-ary (where n > 1) function into a stack of nested unary functions. The need for such a transformation came from the desire to more strictly fomalize functions. Namely, functions are considered to always have a single output value which is not the case for function's input, yielding the notion of function's arity. In order to formalize both input and output of functions and fix it to a single value, Moses Schönfinkel first described such a device.

for reducing operators with several operands to the successive application of single operand operators

In the last line we have used a trick called Currying (after the logician H. Curry) to solve the problem of introducing a binary operation into a language where all functions must accept a single argument. The referee comments that although `"Currying"` is tastier, `"Schönfinkeling"` might be more accurate.
