# Development of mathematical concepts

- classic and modern treatment of math concepts
- the development of intepretation of mathematical concepts
- math concepts: from classic to modern treatment
- how the understanding of math concepts shifted through math history

* Axioms
  - classic: axioms are obvious implications of definitions
  + modern: axioms are conventional, conditional statements
* theorems
  - are absolute objective truth
  + are implications of the corresponding axioms; derivable from the axioms
* relationships between points, lines etc.
  - are determined by their nature
  + are essential; their nature is not
* mathematical objects
  - are given to us with their structure
  + each mathematical theory describes its objects by some of their properties
* geometry
  - corresponds to an experimental reality
  + geometry is a mathematical truth
  - all geometric properties of the space follow from the axioms
  + axioms of a space need not determine all geometric properties
* geometry
  - is an autonomous and living science	classical
  + geometry is a universal language of mathematics
* space
  - is three-dimensional
  + different concepts of dimension apply to different kind of spaces
* space
  - is the universe of geometry
  + spaces are just mathematical structures, occur in various math branches


## Treatment of axioms

Even today, a lot of (copypasta) books still talk about "self-evident truths", "intuitive understandings" and similar, hopelessly moot stances. The modern interpretation of mathematical axioms dispenses with all that jumbo and lifts all restrictions: axioms are finally free to be whatever the author (of the enclosing theory) wants! The authors need not seek permission, nor plead their readers by appealing to their intuition. Shit, they need not base them axioms on any version (or even notion) of truth!

Now, it is as it should have always been: each theory is a conditinal thing - it is based on a set of arbitrary axioms - if you accept its axioms then here is what follows, here's your collection of (derived) truths. You don't stumbe at the start no more, but are free to proceed laying out your theory, provided you extract a set of fundamental statements at the end - the axioms; and anyone interesting can analyze the thery, acknowedging it relies conditionally on that set of axioms.

However, this opens the door for competition: a theorem that relies on a smaller number, or a more elegant set, or a practical set of axioms wins and the loser theorem is forever forgotten. So, despite the apparent loosening of requirements, one needs to pay even more attention how they define their set of axioms.
