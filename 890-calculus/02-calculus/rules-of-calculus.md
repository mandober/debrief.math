# Calculus rules

- Rules of limits
  - L'Hopital rule
- Rules of differentiation
  - power rule of differentiation (derivative)
  - sum rule
  - product rule
  - quitient rule
  - chain rule
  - additional identities
- Integration rules
  - power rule of integration (antiderivative)
  - u-substitution
  - integration by parts
  - additional identities


## Differentiation rules

- power rule: xᵏ = kxᵏ⁻¹

## Integration rules

>ₐ∫ᵇ f(x) dx = F(x) = F(b) - F(a)

- power rule: xᵏ = xᵏᐩ¹/(k+1)

### Integration by parts



### Additional identities

- antiderivative of `1/(1+x²)` is `arctan x + C`
