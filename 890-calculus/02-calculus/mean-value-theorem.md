# Mean Value Theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem

The *Mean Value Theorem* (or Lagrange's mean value theorem) states, roughly, that for a given planar arc between two endpoints, there is at least one point at which the tangent to the arc is parallel to the secant through its endpoints. It is one of the most important results in real analysis. This theorem is used to prove statements about a function on an interval starting from local hypotheses about derivatives at points of the interval.
