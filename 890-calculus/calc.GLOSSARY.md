# Calculus :: GLOSSARY

## Asymptote
An asymptote is a line the graph of a function approaches (but never touches) as the value of a function tends to infinity. The distance between a function's graph and the asymptote line approaches zero as both tend to infinity, but they never touch.

## Slope
The slope (gradient) of a line is a number that describes (the direction and) the steepness (incline, grade) of the line. A straight line is defined in terms of two distinct points, but another way to define it is in terms of one point and a slope, according to the equation (function) `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope.

## 2-D Cartesian coordinate system
The 2-D Cartesian coordinate system pertains to a 2-D Euclidean (flat) plane. The two dimensions are labelled `x` and `y` (they may stand for two dimensions like height and width). Each dimension is represented by a line, called *axis*. One line (usually drawn horizontally) is the *x-axis*, while the other line (usually drawn vertically) is the *y-axis*. The axes intersect at the right angle and that intersection point is called the *origin*, and labelled (0, 0). An axis contains numbers, called *coordinates*, so each axis is a number line, ℝ. The plane is then ℝ². The 2-D Cartesian coordinate system can describe any point in this plance by a pair of coordinates. Any point in this plane is defined by an x-coordinate and y-coordinate, packed together as an ordered pair, `(x, y)`, e.g. (-3.28, 4.12).

## x-intercept
The x-intercept is a point on the x-axis where a line or curve intersects the x-axis. Together with y-intercept, zero of a function, fixedpoints, etc. it belongs to a set of function's interesting properties.

## y-intercept
The y-intercept is a point on the y-axis where a line or curve intersects the y-axis. The y-intercept
