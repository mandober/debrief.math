# Calculus :: GLOSSARY

## Antiderivative
An antiderivative is the result of integration. In fact it is called a general antiderivative since it represents a whole family of functions.

## Asymptote
An asymptote is an imaginary line in the (Cartesian) coordinate system that the graph of function approaches (but never touches) as the function value tends to infinity. The distance between a function's graph and an asymptote keeps closing in as both tend to infinity, but never reaches zero. There are horizontal, vertical and oblique asymptotes.

## Calculus
Calculus is a branch of math that studies change and the rate of change. Calculus is traditionally divided into differential and integral calculus.

## Calculus of variations
The calculus of variations (or variational calculus) is a field of mathematical analysis that uses variations (small changes in functions) to find maxima and minima, which map a set of functions to real numbers.

## Critical point
Critical points (Critical numbers or values) are points in the graph of a function where the derivative is either zero or undefined. Critical points include extrema (minimum and maximum), inflection points, x- and y-intercepts.

## Complex Analysis
Complex Analysis is a part of math dealing with complex numbers and functions of complex variables. It is mostly used to emphasize the use of complex numbers as opposed to real numbers.

## Continuous function
A continuous function is a function without discontinuity in the form of jumps and asymptotes.

## Curve
A curve is a shape plotted in the 2D Cartesian coordinate plane. Broadly, a curve can be any geometric shape, including straight lines. In a more narrow sense, curves are generally the graphs of functions or defined by equations, excluding straight lines.

## Dependent variable
A variable that depends on an independent variable. In functions `f(x) = y`, `y` is a dependent variable that depends on `x`.

## Derivative
A derivative quantifies the sensitivity of change of a function's output with respect to its input.

A derivative of a function at a particular input value is the slope of the tangent line at that point (the point determined by the input value). 

Tangent line is the best *linear approximation* of the function cosidering a small patch of its curve around the point (determined by the input value). 

For this reason, the derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change, or the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable.

## Differentiation
The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.

## Differential
A differential wrt a variable `x` is an infinitesimal `dx`.

## Differential equations
A differential equation, `du = 2x dx`, groups a differential on the same side with the same-named variables.

## Differential algebra
Broadly speaking, differential algebra is the area of mathematics consisting of the study of *differential equations* and *differential operators* as algebraic objects in view of deriving properties of differential equations and operators without computing the solutions, similarly as polynomial algebras are used for the study of algebraic varieties, which are solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Weyl algebras and Lie algebras may be considered as belonging to differential algebra.

## Differentiable function
A function of a real variable, `f : ℝ → ℝ`, is differentiable at a point determined by the input value `x  ∈ ℝ`, if the function's domain contains an open interval `(a, b) ∈ ℝ`, such that `x ∈ (a, b)`, as well as the limit exists, `lim{h → 0} (f(x + h) − f x)/h`.

A function is said to be differentiable over an interval (an interval is a subset of its domain). This implies that a function need not be differentiable everywhere, but sometimes it is enough if it is differentiable over an interval of interest (then we say that it is differentiable over that interval).

## Δx
`Δx` represents the (absolute) difference between two input values (relevant to of some function in the context). If we have fixed an input value of interest `x₀`, then we can vary the other input value by a quantity `h`, leaving that other point to be determined by `x₀ + h`. `Δx` stands for any difference between two inputs, big or small, but in the context of calculus, it represents a difference that keeps decreasing as `h` tends to 0. In this sense, `Δx` is similar to `dx`.

## dx
`dx` (and other variables like `dt`, `dy`) is called a *differential*, and it occurs in differential equations. `dx` represents the difference between two input values of some function (in context), but unlike `Δx` which may be of any size, `dx` is so small (yet larger then 0) it belongs to a kind of numbers called *infinitesimals*.

## Fractional calculus
Fractional calculus is a branch of mathematical analysis that studies the several different possibilities of defining real number powers or complex number powers of the differentiation operator `D`.

## Function
A function is a special kind of relation. A unary function is a binary relation, so it is an association between two sets. A binary relation betwern set `A` and `B` consists of order pairs `(a, b)`, where elements of domain `A` are associated to elements of codomain `B`, providing a sense of direction. A function is similar except each element of the domain must participate in the relation and it may be associated to at most one element of the codomain. A function, or, more precisely, function's graph is a set of order pairs, (a, b), like for relations. The difference is a constraint that `f(a) = b`. So an order pair belonging to the function's graph may be denoted by `(a,b)` or `(a,f(a))`. Formal definition of function's graph: `f = {(x, y)|x ∈ A, y ∈ B, f(x)=y}`. Besides its graph, a function is only fully defined if its codomain is also stated. In fact, domain may be elided as it can be inferred from its graph by selecting all the first components from ordered pairs. So a fully defined function is a triple `(A, f, B)` or a tuple `(f, B)`. The need to state the codomain is obvious when we consider two functions that are the same in everything except their codomain set; e.g. the only difference between `f:ℕ→ℚ` and `g:ℕ→ℝ`, with both having the same definition, is the expanded codomain of `g`. All elements that are a first component in ordered pairs that is the function's graph are unique.

Functions are very important in calculus; we often plot their graphs as curves in the coordinate plane, then aim to find the tangent lines related to some point on the curve. We also often want to know the area under a curve defined by some function, or the area between two curves. Functions are their curves have many properties we are interested in, such as interceptions, extrema, inflection and other crictical points. If nothing else, we want to plot functions so we can visualize them.

## Integral


## Integral Transforms
Integral transforms are linear mathematical operators that act on functions to alter the domain. Transforms are used to make certain integrals and differential equations easier to solve algebraically. There are many types of integral transforms with a wide variety of uses, including image and signal processing, physics, engineering, statistics and mathematical analysis.

## Indefinite integral
An unbounded integral is an indefinite integral, the result of which is called a general antiderivative since it is a whole family of functions.

## Independent variable
A variable that does not depend on any variable. In functions `f(x) = y`, `x` is the independent variable.

## Interval
An interval is a contiguous range of numbers between two endpoints. The endpoints themselves may or may not be included in the interval. When excluded, the interval is open, `(a, b)`; when included, it is closed, `[a, b]`. There is also a half-open, `[a, b)`, and half-closed interval, `(a, b]`. Related to a function, an interval is a subset of the function's domain. Sometimes, we are interested if the function satisfies given properties over the interval.

## Intercept
In general, the x-intercept is a point on the x-axis where a line (or curve, in general) intersects it, and similarly for the y-intercept. The equation for defining a line in point-intercept form, `y = mx + b`, explicitly mentions the y-intercept as `b`. 

In the coordinate plane, a vertical line only intersects the x-axis, and a horizontal line only intersects the y-axis. All other lines are bound to cross both axes.

These two intercepts, along with zero of a function, extrema, concavity, inflection and other critical points comprise properties we are often interested in when considering a curve.

## Lamina
In geometery, lamina is a collective noun for flat 2D objects with no thickness (contrasted by solid objects). A planar lamina (or plane lamina) is a figure representing a thin, usually uniform, flat layer of the solid. It serves also as an idealized model of a planar cross section of a solid body in integration. Planar laminas can be used to determine moments of inertia, or center of mass of flat figures, as well as an aid in corresponding calculations for 3D bodies.

## Line
A line is a 1D geometric object consisting of an infinite set of points. In the coordinate plane, a line may be defined in several ways, perphaps the most intuitively via two distinct points that it intersects. Another common way to define a line is using the slope-intercept form, `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope of the line, and `b` is the y-intercept, while `(x, y)` coordinates make up the set of all points belonging to the line.

## Method of exhaustion
The method of exhaustion was an integral-like limiting process used by Archimedes to compute the area and volume of 2D lamina (2D objects) and 3D solids.

## Real analysis
The part of math dealing with functions of real variables, `ℝ → ℝ`. While this includes some portions of topology, it is most commonly used to make a distinction between real and complex functions.

## Relation
A binary relation is a directed association between two sets: elements of the first set, called domain, `A`, are associated to elements of the second set, called codomain, `B`, thus providing a sense of directionality. A relation, `R`, is thus a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets, `R ⊆ A×B`. If `R` coincides with the Cartesian product then it is called a full relation. Domain of a function may be inferred from its graph, which is not the case for relations. So, a relation is only fully defined if, besides its graph set, we also know the domain and codomain sets, `(A, R, B)`. The need to know all three of these things is undelined by existence of the null (empty) relation between two sets.

## Rolle's theorem
Rolle's theorem (or Rolle's lemma) essentially states that any real-valued differentiable function that attains equal values at two distinct points must have at least one point, somewhere between them, at which the slope of the tangent line is zero. Such a point is known as a stationary point. It is a point at which the first derivative of the function is zero. The theorem is named after Michel Rolle.

## Slope
The slope (gradient) of a line describes its steepness (incline, grade). The slope of a line is given by a difference quotient, `Δy/Δx`, where Δy is the "rise", `Δy = f(x+h) - f(x)`, i.e. offset in vertical direction, while `Δx = h` is the "run" or offset in horizontal direction from some point. Given a point at `(x, y)` on a line with slope 2, the next point on the line can be found at `(x+2, y+1)`, i.e. by going 2 up and 1 across since the slope is 2 = 2/1, i.e. it is the ratio of vertical (2) vs horizontal (1) offset.

The slope is conveniently expressed as a rational number, `m = p/q`, e.g. the slope of 1 should be understood as 1/1. This means that given a point `A` on the line, along with its slope `m = p/q`, we can figure out the coordinates of another point on the line by going `p` units up then `q` units right. If the slope is a negative number, `m = -p/q`, then we'd go `p` units down and `q` units right. A line with a positive slope subtends an angle between 0ᵒ and 90ᵒ with the x-axis. A line with a negative slope subtends an angle between 90ᵒ and 180ᵒ with the x-axis. When the slope is 0, it is a *horizontal line*, and its equation is reduced to `y = b` (`b` is still the y-intercept, i.e. the place on the y-axis where the horizontal line crosses it). A *vertical line* has undefined slope, and its equation is `x = c` (where `c` is the place on the x-axis where the vertical line crosses it). The slope-intercept form is another common way to define a line, `y = mx + b`, where `m` is the slope and `b` is the y-intercept. A (perfectly) *diagonal line* has the shape of a slash charcter, (`/`), and it is defined by the identity function, `f(x) = x`. This is the same as the equation `y = x`. The slope of this line is 1. The function `f(x) = -x`, or equation `y = -x`, defines the other kind of diagonal, the one with the opposite orientation, that has the shape of a backslash charcter (`\`). The slope of this line is -1.
