# Calculus :: Precalculus

## Precursor to calculus

This, `precalculus`, section is just an alias for the `algebra` section. Algebra has its own section, but some of its topics were aggregated here as a precursor to studying calculus. Eventually all these topics will be moved to an adequate folder inside the algebra folder (which is far more vast topic then its parts mentioned here).
