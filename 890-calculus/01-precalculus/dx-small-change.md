# Introduction to Derivatives

https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html

The process of differentiation produces derivatives of functions, and derivatives are about the *slope*. A line is defined by one of several line equations, the most common of which is `y = mx + b`, where `m` stands for the slope of the line.

```js
         Δy     change in y
slope = ----- = ------------
         Δx     change in x
```

The slope is the ratio between the "rise over run", i.e. the ratio between the change in `y` over the change in `x`. The rise is the offset from some stationary point on the line in the vertical direction, and run is the offset in horizontal direction.

If we know the coordinates of two points on the line `P₀ = (x₀, y₀)` and `P₁ = (x₁, y₁)` we can find the slope of the line. We calculate the change in `x` as `Δx = x₁ - x₀` and the change in `y` as `Δy = y₁ - y₀`.
