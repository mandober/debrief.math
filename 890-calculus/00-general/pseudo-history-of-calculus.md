# Pseudo-history of calculus

A pseudo-history of mathematics is a straightforward sequence of events where the previous events inspire the subsequent ones and every development follows logically from the one before. However, this is not how things actually occured in the real timeline of mathematics, which is more random and complicated and where events seldomly occur in a logical order.

For example, it is rather the case that calculus was developed first, and the analytical properties of the real number system were discovered/created to account for holes in our concept of continuity.
