- Prerequisits to calculus
- Precalculus
- Calculus
- Calculus proper

There are topics that belong to other math branches but need refreshers. Such topics constitute a prerequisit to calculus.

Then, there are topics that maybe should belong to calculus proper, but it is unclear whether they do, so they sort of hang in the precalculus limbo. These topics constitute precalculus.

Calculus proper traditionally consists of two large subjects, differentiation and integration, which are introduced by examining the problems that motivated the need to invent (discover?) them.
- finding the tangent line for a given point on a curve
- finding the area under a curve

These *curves* are examined in the context of a *coordinate system*, and they are defined as *graphs* of some function. That is, if we take the set of all the input-output pairs of some numeric function - this set is called *the graph of the function* - and interpret it as a collection of *coordinates*, then we can *plot* these coordinate into a *Cartesian coordinate system*, obtaining a certain shape. That shape will be a curved line representing (the graph of) the function.

Now that we have a curve inside a coordinate system, we can ask questions about it like how would we figure out the area under it; meaning the area of the surface bounded from above by the curve, bounded from below by the x-axis, from left by the y-axis, and by some arbitrary line from the right, for example.
