# The need for calculus

Calculating the area of a circle was probably one of the issues that made many an ancient Greek put on their thinking caps on in trying to come up with a plausible plan of attack. Archimedes approached the problem by exhausting all other ideas: keep




- finding the tangent line for a given point on a curve
- finding the area under a curve

Functions, probably, are among the elementary culprits that participated in creating problems which could not be resolved with the tools available to mathematics up until that time, prompting the need to development new technics, which eventually culminated in the discsovery of calculus.

The framework in which these problems arose was related to plotting various geometric objects within the Cartesian coordinate system. Any geometric object consists of a set of points, which, interpreted as coordinates, could be plotted in the coordinate plane.

Functions that operated on numbers could be plotted in a similar manner. We can take the set of all the input-output pairs of some function, and use it as a collection of coordinates which we can plot in the Cartesian coordinate system, obtaining a certain shape. Such shape is called the graph of the function, but it should be distinguished from the set of ordered pair that make that function (functional relation) - that set of ordered pairs of function's input-output values is also called *the graph of the function*. One graph is a plot (drawing) inside a coordinate system, the other is an abstract set. The shape we thus obtain will be a curve (curved line) representing the function.

Now that we have a *curve* inside a coordinate system, we can ask questions about it like how would we figure out the area under it; meaning the area of the surface bounded from above by the curve, bounded from below by the x-axis, from left by the y-axis, and by some arbitrary line from the right, for example.
