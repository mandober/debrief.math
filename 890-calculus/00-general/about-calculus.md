# About Calculus

Calculus uses methods originally based on the summation of infinitesimal differences.

Calculus includes the examination of changes in an expression by smaller and smaller differences.

Calculus was developed to account for holes in the concept of continuity.

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, infinite series, and more.

Calculus is used when using algebra alone becomes insufficient.

Calculus constitutes a major part of contemporary mathematics education.

In modern curriculum calculus is part of or also known as Analysis.

In general, *a calculus* is an abstract theory developed in a purely formal way. *The calculus*, also called *Mathematical Analysis*, is the branch of mathematics studying the rate of change of quantities (which can be interpreted as slopes of curves) and the length, area, and volume of objects.

Calculus is traditionally divided into *differential calculus*, concerned with *derivatives*, and *integral calculus*, concerned with *integrals*.

*Real Analysis* is the portion of calculus dealing with real numbers and functions of real variables.

*Complex Analysis* is the portion of calculus dealing with complex numbers and functions of complex variables.


The central operation of integral calculus, integration, is much like summation, but while summation (`Σ`) operates over discete quantities, integration (`∫`) operetes over continuous ones. Both operations use symbols that represent the letter "s" (for summation).

The central operation of differential calculus is differentiation which finds the derivatives of functions. A derivative is represented as the tangent line for a particular point on a curve. At that point, the derivative of a function approximates that function to a high degree of correctness, but only over a small interval around it.


While ideas related to calculus had been known for some time (*Archimedes' method of exhaustion* was a form of calculus), it was not until the independent work of Newton and Leibniz that the modern elegant tools and ideas of calculus were developed. Even so, many years elapsed until the subject was put on a mathematically rigorous footing by mathematicians such as Weierstrass.
