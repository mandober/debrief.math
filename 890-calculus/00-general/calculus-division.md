# Calculus

Calculus is traditionally divided into two main fields:
- Differential calculus
- Integral calculus

**Differential calculus** is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of *rates at which quantities change*.

**Integral calculus** is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of *area beneath a curve*.

>Differential calculus breaks an object into pieces to find how it changes. Integral calculus integrates the pieces to find the quantity.

Differential calculus was inspired by the problem of finding the tangent of a point on a curve defined by a function.

Integral calculus was inspired by the problem of finding the area under a curve defined by a function.

**Differentiation** is the basic operation in differential calculus concerned with derivatives of functions and differentials.

*Rules of differentiation* are rules by which the derivative of a complicated function can be found by differentiating its simpler component functions.

A *derivative* is the rate at which an output changes with respect to input. Working out a derivative is called differentiation.

Finding a derivative usually means following one or more rules, with the creative part being figuring out which rules to apply and in which order, although there are even guidelines for that too. Once this is determined, it is nearly automatic to get to the solution.

**Integration** is the basic operation in integral calculus concerned with integrals and antiderivatives of functions.

Finding an antiderivative, unlike finding a derivative, involves a lot more effort since there is no complete set of rules to follow. Tables of common and known integrals exist, but solving an uknown integral falls back to creative work.

An **integral** is the continuous analog of a sum used to calculate areas and volumes and their generalizations. Integration is the process of computing an integral.

A **differential equation** is an equation with a function and one or more of its derivatives. For example, an equation with the function `y` and its differential derivative `dy/dx` is `y + dy/dx = 5x`.

The `dy/dx` is called a **differential**.
