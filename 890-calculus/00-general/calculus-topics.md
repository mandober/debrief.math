# Calculus topics

There are strictly calculus topics, but there are also prerequisits and primers needed for studying calculus. Some of these primers clearly belong to other areas of mathematics, but there are many others whose categorization is not so clear cut. Such subjects are usually gathered under the umbrella term precalculus.

- prerequisits
- precalculus
- calculus proper

Prerequisits and precalculus' topics include
- equations, equalities, inequalities
- functions
- plotting function graphs
- coordinate systems
- graphs
- geometric objects: lines, curves
- line equations
- tangent and secant lines
- limits
- sequences
- series
- convergence (divergence)


Calculus proper includes its two traditional branches, differential and integral calculus, which were expanded and it now includes additional wholesome topics.

Main branches of calculus
- Differential calculus
- Integral calculus
- Multivariable calculus
- Vector calculus
- Fractional calculus
- Differential Geometry
