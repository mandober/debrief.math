# About the word Calculus

Which article should be used with the term "calculus"?

To figure out the answer, here is a brief refresher on definiteness.


(what about "be" instead of "are", e.g. in "…when capitals be needed")


### Definiteness

In linguistics, definiteness is a semantic feature of noun phrases that distinguishes between referents *identifiable* in a given context and those that are not.

`ε` English language has two levels of `∅` definiteness:
- definiteness (definite referents)
- indefiniteness (indefinite referents)

Each level comes in two different degrees manifest by the total of 4 articles.

Articles are words (grammatical entities) belonging to the gramatical category of determiners (DET).

Articles signify definiteness of the referring noun phrase (NP).

Definiteness is contrasted by indefiniteness across one axes. However, there is a total of 4 degrees of definiteness conveyed by 4 articles (or 3 articles as some linguist insist).

degree




`The` 4 articles, in `the` decreasing level of definiteness:
- definiteness (definite, defined, identifiable referents):
  - null article       (ε),         highest degree of definiteness
  - definite article   ("the"),     high degree of definiteness
- indefiniteness (indefinite, undefined, unidentifiable referents):
  - indefinite article ("a", "an")  low degree of definiteness
  - empty article (∅)               lowest degree of definiteness

The definite noun phrases pick out a unique, familiar, specific referent, like
- Australia (null article)
- the sun (definite article)

The indefinite noun phrases pick out a non-specific referent, e.g.
- an idea (indefinite article)
- some fish (empty article)


* there are two "invisible" articles: the zero article which is the least definite of all ("the boys like Ø1 chicken") and the null article which is the most definite of all ("he will soon be crowned Ø2 king").



The trouble is that the higest and lowest degree of definiteness use seemingly the same article which has no syntactic manifestation. Semantically, they may be explicitly denoted by `ε` for the definite article, and `∅` for the indefinite article.

A related problem is a distinction between grammatical definiteness and cognitive identifiability that sometimes occurs. There are times when a grammatically marked definite noun phrase is not in fact identifiable. For example, "the polar bear's habitat is the Arctic" does not refer to a unique, familiar, specific bear, making for a form-meaning mismatch.

Another related problem is the lack of concensuss on the names and symbols assigned to the most definite and the most indefinite article. It would seem that the most definite article is usually called the *empty article* and marked explicitly with `ε`, while the most indefinite is called the *null article* and marked by `∅`. Among the linguist that recognize both, some use the *zero article* as a synonym for the empty article, while others use the zero article as an alias for the null article. Yet a third group reserves the phrase "zero article" for either one of the two "invisible" articles. Still another use is as the name for the category of *unmarked determiners*, which includes other grammatical elements beside the two ghosts of departed articles.


A third problem is that many linguists do not distinguish between the null and empty article, categorizing both of them as the *zero article*, at least gramatically, even though semantically, the difference is rather obvious, as it the difference between the higest and lowest degree of definiteness.

Another problem is that some linguist do not even mention the zero article, recognizing only the articles `a(n)` (as indefinite) and `the` (as definite).




In English, definiteness is usually marked by the selection of *determiner*. Certain determiners ("a", "an", "many", "some"), along with numbers (e.g. "four items"), typically mark a noun phrase as *indefinite*. Others ("the", "that") and genitive noun phrases (e.g. "my brother") typically mark the noun phrase as *definite*.

A number of tests have been proposed to distinguish definite from indefinite noun phrases. ("Each has a foundation in intuition, as well as some degree of grammatical effect. However, it is not clear that any of them corresponds cleanly to formal categories").
- If a noun phrase can be put into an *existential clause*, such as "there is X at the door" (e.g. "there are two wolves at the door"), it is likely indefinite.
- The concept of identifiability expressed by the definite article is best understood in terms of pre-empting a question with *which?*.



## Using the right article

Singular
- [x]     Calculus
- [x] ε   calculus
- [x] a   calculus
- [x] the calculus
- [x] ∅   calculus
Plural
- [x] ε   calculi
- []  a   calculi
- [x] the calculi
- [x] ∅   calculi


In the decreasing level of definiteness (determinateness)
- "calculus"     uses the null article
- "the calculus" uses the definite article
- "a calculus"   uses an indefinite article
- "calculus"     uses the empty article

### As a noun

In Latin
- from Latin `calculus` meaning "pebble" (plural `calculī`)
`calculus` n., pl. `calculi`
- a formally defined system (language, theory, framework)
- calculus, n, countable and uncountable, pl. calculi or calculuses
- borrowed from Latin `calculus`, pebble used as a reckoning counter in abacus
- diminutive of `calx` ("limestone") + `-ulus`


In English
- calculus /ˈkæl.kjə.ləs/, cal‧cu‧lus
- calculus, n., countable and uncountable, pl. calculi or calculuses
1. (dated, countable) Calculation; computation.
2. (countable, mathematics) Any formal system in which symbolic expressions are manipulated according to fixed rules.
3. (uncountable, often definite as "the calculus")
- Differential calculus and integral calculus considered as a single subject
- synonyms: infinitesimal calculus
- near-synonyms: analysis, mathematical analysis

In general, *a calculus* denotes any formally defined mathematical theory. Thus, a calculus is also used as an alias for a formal system or mathematical framework. Math is full of various calculi, including
- Lambda Calculus (a formal theory of functions)
- Predicate Calculus
- Propositional Calculus (a system of formal logic)
- Join-calculus (*a process calculus* developed to provide a formal basis for the design of distributed programming)

In fact, calculus itself is just an abbreviation of *Differential Calculus* and *Integral Calculus*, which at the same time unites them under a single name. Its generality and utility is probably the reason that the differential, integral and multivariable calculi all become known simply as *calculus*. There are many calculi in math but only one won the right to be known by the unqualified noun "calculus".

*The calculus* is a branch of mathematics, also known by several other names including Mathematical Analysis. However, the phrase "the calculus" is rarely used within the context of calculus - in such context, using the bare word *calculus* is the norm (we could say it uses the null article). When it feels akward to use the definite article people often capitalize the word, *Calculus* (to refer to Mathematical Analysis).
