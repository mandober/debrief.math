# Calculus :: SUMMARY

Terms
- 2-d Cartesian coordinate system
  - unit
  - a point (x, y)
  - quadrant
    - I   x > 0, y > 0 (x,y > 0)
    - II  x < 0, y > 0
    - III x > 0, y < 0
    - IV  x < 0, y < 0 (x,y < 0)
  - origin (0, 0)
  - x-axis (x, 0)
  - y-axis (0, y)
- function
  - x-intercept
  - y-intercept
- line
  - line equation, `y = mx + b`
  - `m` accounts for the line's rotation
  - `b` accounts for the line's position (offset)
  - if `b = 0` the line intersects the origin
  - if `m > 0` the line is increasing
  - if `m < 0` the line is decreasing
  - if `m = 0` the line is horizontal
  - if `m = undefined` the line is vertical, i.e.
    as `m → ±∞`, the line tends to being perfectly vertical
  - slope (gradient) of a line, `m`
  - direction of a line
  - steepness (incline, grade) of a line
  - vertical to horizontal change
  - rise over run

Details
- a line is defined by two distinct points, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂).
- a line is defined by the equation `y = mx + b`.
- slope (gradient) of a line is a number describing both the direction and steepness (incline, grade) of the line.
- slope is calculated by finding the ratio of vertical to horizontal change, i.e. rise over run, between any two distinct points on a line.
- slope (gradient), direction, steepness (incline, grade) all pertain to a line
- slope is a quantity, a number
- gradient (slope) is a number that describes direction and grade of a line
- grade of a line, aka incline or steepness
- line gets de/increasing, not its slope/direction/grade
- line gets increasing, i.e. it goes up from left to right
- line gets decreasing, i.e. it goes down from left to right
- line gets horizontal, i.e. parallel with x-axis or orthogonal to y-axis
- line gets vertical,   i.e. parallel with y-axis or orthogonal to x-axis
- line is increasing (goes UP from ltr) if slope is positive
- line is decreasing (goes DOWN from ltr) if slope is negative
- line is horizontal (parallel to x-axis) if slope is zero
- line is vertical (orthogonal to x-axis) if slope is undefined
- when line is horizontal, the line equation is a constant function
- line equation: `y = f x = mx + b`
