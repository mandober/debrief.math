# Antiderivative

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative

An **antiderivative** (
  inverse derivative, 
  indefinite integral, 
  general integral, 
  integral, 
  primitive integral, 
  primitive function, 
  complete primitive, 
  general solution) 
of a continuous function `f` 
is a differentiable function `F` 
whose derivative is equal 
to the original function `f`.

    ∫ f(x) dx = F(x) ==> F′(x) = f(x)
    ∫ 3x² dx = x³ ==> (x³)′ = 3x²


Note: Antiderivatives are also called *general integrals*, and sometimes just integrals. The latter term is generic, and refers not only to indefinite integrals (antiderivatives), but also to definite integrals. When the word "integral" is used without additional specification, the reader is supposed to deduce from the context whether it refers to a definite or indefinite integral. Some authors define the *indefinite integral* of a function as the set of its infinitely many possible antiderivatives. Others define it as an arbitrarily selected element of that set. In some textbooks one can find the term "complete primitive" to refer to the solution (also called the general solution) of a differential equation that includes the arbitrary constant.


The process of solving for antiderivatives is called *antidifferentiation* (or indefinite integration), and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative. Antiderivatives are often denoted by capital letters such as `F` and `G`.

Antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through 
**The second fundamental theorem of calculus**:
>The definite integral of a function over a closed interval where the function is *Riemann integrable* is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.

The graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other, with each graph's vertical location depending upon the value `C`.
