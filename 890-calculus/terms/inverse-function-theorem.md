# Inverse function theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function_theorem

In differential calculus, the *Inverse Function Theorem* gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain; namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point.

The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function.

In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose *Jacobian determinant* is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the *Jacobian matrix* of the inverse.

There are also versions of the Inverse Function Theorem for *holomorphic functions*, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth.

The theorem was first established by Picard and Goursat using an iterative scheme: the basic idea is to prove a fixed point theorem using the contraction mapping theorem.
