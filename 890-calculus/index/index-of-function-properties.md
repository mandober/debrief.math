Properties and types of functions

Elements of functions
- algebraic functions (polynomials)
  - terms
    - variables
    - coefficients
  - term degree
  - polynomial degree
- rational function
  - nominator
  - denominator
- exponential functions, `eˣ`
  - simple exponents
    - `x` as in `eˣ`
    - const exp as in `e⁴`
    - `x` mutliplied by const (like `2x`) as in `e²ˣ`

- Simple functions
  - identity function, f(x) = x
  - const function,    f(x) = C     (for C ∈ ℝ)
  - var and const,     f(x) = C x    (for C ∈ ℝ)
  - f(x) = x + 1
  - f(x) = 3x + 1


Function/equation/curve properties
- continous vs discontinous functions
- differentiable vs non-differentiable functions
- concave vs convex curves/functions


Function properties
- intercept points
  - x-intercept
  - y-intercept
- asymptotes (graphs/functions)
  - horizontal asymptote
  - vertical asymptote
  - oblique asymptote
- concavity
  - concave-up
  - concave-down
- critical points
  - corners
  - discontinuities
    - jump
    - removable vs non-removable
    - asymptotes
  - inflection points (change of concavity)
  - extrema
    - minimum
      - local (relative) minimum
      - global (absolute) minimum
    - maximum
      - local (relative) maximum
      - global (absolute) maximum
