## Limit rules with arithewmtic ops

- Constant:   `lim{x→a} c ∙ f x    =  c ∙ lim{x→a} f x`

- Sum:        `lim{x→a} f x + g x  =  lim{x→a} f x + lim{x→a} g x`
- Difference: `lim{x→a} f x - g x  =  lim{x→a} f x - lim{x→a} g x`
- Product:    `lim{x→a} f x ∙ g x  =  lim{x→a} f x ∙ lim{x→a} g x`
- Quotient:   `lim{x→a} f x ÷ g x  =  lim{x→a} f x ÷ lim{x→a} g x`

- Powers:     `lim{x→a} (f x)ⁿ     =  (lim{x→a} f x)ⁿ`
- Roots:      `lim{x→a} √(f x)     =  √(lim{x→a} f x)`

## Evaluating limits

The limit (the limiting value) is treated as an input value (as an argument, or the x-coordinate) of a function, and we try to determine the function's output for that input. The value of the function may be different from the value of the limit for that input: the function may have one value, while the limit is a different value; or the limit may not exist (unbounded).

It may also be the case that the limit evaluates to two different values depending on the direction of approach to that point (from left or from right). A limit may be approached from the negative direction (from left), denoted by placing a superscript minus (`c⁻`) on the limiting value, `lim{x→c⁻}`. A limit may also be approached from the positive direction (from right), `lim{x→cᐩ}`, denoted by superscripting the plus sign on the limit (`cᐩ`).

Generally, only the overall limit of a point is considered, and it exists only if both limits for that point exist and they are exactly the same. Sometimes, only one direction of a limit is considered, in which case we talk about a *one-sided limit*, which either exist or it is *unbounded*.
