# Integration rules and technics

*Integration* is the basic operation in integral calculus. 

However, unlike differentiation which has straightforward rules by which the derivatives of a function can be found, integration has no such wholesome rules for every situtation. There are a few general rules and some guidelines, but for the most part there are no cemented rules, so we have to follow our intuition to solve it (if there is a solution at all). That is why having tables of known integrals handy is useful.

The integration rules that do exists are derived from the corresponding rules of differentiation by reverse-engineering.
