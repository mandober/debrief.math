# Integration

Often we know the relationship involving the rate of change of two variables, but we may need to know the direct relation between the two variables. For example, we may know the velocity of an object at a particular time, but we may want to know the position of the object at that time.

To find this direct relationship, we need to use the process which is opposite to differentiation, called integration (or antidifferentiation).

Uses of integration include finding the area under a curve, finding the centre of mass, displacement and velocity, fluid flow, modelling the behaviour of objects under stress, etc.

*Differential equations* are one type of integration.
