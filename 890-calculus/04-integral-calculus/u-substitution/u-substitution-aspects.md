# Substitution :: Aspects

When applying the u-substitution rule to solve an integral, we need to consider:
- which subexpression of the integrand to select for `u`
- that equation for `u` will be differentiated to…
- …obtain an equation for `dx` in terms of `du`, usually as `dx = du/δ`
- what happens with leftover expressions of the integrand?
  - they get fully cancelled with `δ` expression
  - they get partially cancelled leaving behind a constant: 
    pull the constant out placing it in front of the integral
  - *otherwise?*



integration employed when we have a combination of functions as the integrand. We have to pick a subexpression of the integrand and have it represented by a fresh variable `u`. We'll rewrite the integral with `u` in place of the selected subexpression, but we also need to account for other parts of integral, primarily for the differential `dx` which needs to rewriten as an expression in terms of `du` derived from the equation for `u`. But what about other leftover expressions?
