# Integrating rational functions

Rational functions are expressions with fractions, with one function as a nominator and another as denominator.

## Exercise 1: Simple manipulations

```js
∫ 5/√(9-9x²) dx
= ∫ 5/√9(1-x²) dx
= 5/3 ∫ √(1-x²) dx  // arcsin′x = 1/√(1+x²)
= 5/3 arcsinx + C
```

## Exercise 2: Formula for unit fractions with a linear denominator

```js
∫ 1/(ax+b) dx = 1/a ln|ax+b| + C
```
