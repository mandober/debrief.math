# Integral calculus

The basic idea of Integral Calculus is finding the area under a curve.

As a first approximation, we can get a rough idea about the area under a curve by fitting a small number of rectangles under it. We can improve on it by increasing the number of rectangles. As the number of rectangles, `n`, gets bigger, their widths, `Δx`, tends to 0, but the area approaches its true value. In the limit, as `n` approaches infinity and `Δx` approaches 0, the area under the curve tends to its precise value, `⎰{a..b} f(x) dx`.

Integration and differentiation are each other's opposites. A derivative of a function `f(x)`, denoted `d/dx f(x)` or `f′(x)`, is another function (with its polynomial degree decreased by one), and then the antiderivative of that function gets us back to the original function `f(x)`.

- `f(x)`                  original function
- `g(x) = (f(x))′`        derivative of `f`
- `⎰g(x)dx = G(x) + C`    antiderivative of `g`
- `(G(x) + C)′ = g(x)`    derivative of `f`
