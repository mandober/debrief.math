# Riemann sum

The Riemann sum is based on a summation of areas of a finite number of rectangles fitted under a curve in order to approximate the area under it.

Depending on the chosen *endpoint* (sampling point), used to get the heigth of rectangles, we talk about left and right Riemann sum.


Note: we often incorrectly use the word "point" when referring to just an x-coordinate, i.e. to an input value `x`, which is just one component of a point. However, this is sufficiently justified by the fact there is always a function around we can apply to that `x` in order to get `y`, i.e. the y-coordinate which would let us form a proper point, as a pair `(x, y)`. That is, we can call `x` alone a point because we have `f` on the stadby, ready to produce the corresponding `y` if needed to form a point `(x, y) = (x, f x)`.

Note: in calculus, as in the most of math, the notation for applying a function `f` to an argument `x` is a verbose form `f(x)`. In fact, calculus seems not to make a distinction between the function `f` and the function application `f(x)` as we never see `f` used by itself, which it should be when we want to refer to the function `f`, and not to the application of `f` to an argument `x`, which is what the form `f(x)` implies. In fact, the form `f(x)` may also be interpreted as a weird reference to a function declaration, or even to a function definition, if it really is followed by a definition, e.g. `f(x) = x²` is a function definition. However, a function declaration is meaningless in math as math has no need for forward (function) declarations. Perhaps, the only useful piece of information a function declaration provides - if `f(x)` could be interpreted as such - is the fact that parameter's name is `x` (and not e.g. `z`) - this does bear significance in calculus since different variable names may be used (often to replace) more complex expressions (e.g. let `u = x²+3` is the reason for calling it the u-substitution rule, then differentiating wrt to `u` - so having `d/du` somewhere).
