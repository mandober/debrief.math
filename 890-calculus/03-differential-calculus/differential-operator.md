# Differential operator

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_operator

A **differential operator** is an operator defined as a function of the *differentiation operator*. 

It is helpful, as a matter of notation first, to consider differentiation as an abstract operation that accepts a function and returns another function (such functions are called functionals).

This article considers mainly *linear differential operators*, which are the most common type. However, non-linear differential operators also exist, such as the *Schwarzian derivative*.
