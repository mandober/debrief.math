# Leibniz's notation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%27s_notation

In calculus, Leibniz's notation, named in honor of the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols `dx` and `dy` to represent *infinitely small (aka infinitesimal) increments* of `x` and `y`, just as `Δx` and `Δy` represent *finite increments* of `x` and `y`.

Consider `y` as a function of a variable `x`, or `y = f(x)`; then the derivative of `y` with respect to `x`, which later came to be viewed as the limit

    lim{Δx→0} Δy/Δx = lim{Δx→0} (f(x+Δx) − f(x)) / Δx

was, according to Leibniz, the quotient of an infinitesimal increment of `y` by an infinitesimal increment of `x`, or `dy/dx = f′(x)`, where the right hand side uses the Lagrange's notation for the derivative of `f` at `x`.

The infinitesimal increments are called *differentials*. Related to this is the integral in which the infinitesimal increments are summed (e.g. to compute lengths, areas and volumes as sums of tiny pieces), for which Leibniz also supplied a closely related notation involving the same differentials, a notation whose efficiency proved decisive in the development of continental European mathematics.

Leibniz's concept of infinitesimals, long considered to be too imprecise to be used as a foundation of calculus, was eventually replaced by rigorous concepts developed by Weierstrass and others in the 19th century. Consequently, *Leibniz's quotient notation* was re-interpreted to stand for the limit of the modern definition. 

However, in many instances, the symbols *seemed to act as actual quotients* would, so their usefulness kept 'em popular even in the face of several competing notations.

Several different formalisms were developed in the 20th century that can give rigorous meaning to notions of infinitesimals and infinitesimal displacements, including nonstandard analysis, tangent space, O notation and others.

The derivatives and integrals of calculus can be packaged into the modern theory of *differential forms*, in which the derivative is genuinely a ratio of two differentials, and the integral likewise behaves in exact accordance with Leibniz notation.

However, this requires that derivative and integral first be defined by other means, and as such expresses the self-consistency and computational efficacy of the Leibniz notation rather than giving it a new foundation.


In its modern interpretation, the expression ⁠`dy/dx`⁠ should not be read as the division of two quantities `dx` and `dy` (as Leibniz had envisioned it); rather, the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shorthand for `lim{Δx→0} Δy/Δx` (note `Δ` vs `d`, where `Δ` indicates a finite difference).

The expression may also be thought of as the application of the differential operator ⁠`d/dx`⁠ (again, a single symbol) to `y`, regarded as a function of `x`. This operator is written `D` in Euler's notation. Leibniz did not use this form, but his use of the symbol `d` corresponds fairly closely to this modern concept.

While there is traditionally no division implied by the notation (but see Nonstandard analysis), the division-like notation is useful since in many situations, the derivative operator does behave like a division, making some results about derivatives easy to obtain and remember. This notation owes its longevity to the fact that it seems to reach to the very heart of the geometrical and mechanical applications of the calculus.
