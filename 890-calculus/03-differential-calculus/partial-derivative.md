# Partial derivative

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative

A **partial derivative** of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant (as opposed to the *total derivative*, in which all variables are allowed to vary).

Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry.
