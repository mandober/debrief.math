# The power rule

## The power rule of differentiation

The power rule is the basic, most elementary rule of differentiation, used probably always.

>The power rule: `xⁿ = nxⁿ⁻¹`

Examples:
- (2)′ = (2⋅x⁰)′ = 2⋅0x⁻¹ = 0
- (x)′ = (x¹)′ = 1x⁰ = 1
- (3x)′ = (3x¹)′ = 3⋅1x⁰ = 3⋅1⋅1 = 3
- (x²)′ = 2x
- (3x²)′ = 6x
- (2x³)′ = 6x²
- (3x⁴)′ = 12x³
- (1/x)′ = (x⁻¹)′ = -1x⁻² = -x⁻² = -1/x²
- (1/x²)′ = (x⁻¹)′ = -1x⁻² = -x⁻² = -1/x²
- (√x)′ = (x⁰⋅⁵)′ = (x¹′²)′ = 1/2 ⋅ x⁻¹′² = x⁻¹′²/2 = 1/2 ⋅ 1/√x



## The power rule of integration

The power rule is the basic, most elementary rule of integration, used probably always.

>The power rule: `xⁿ = xⁿᐩ¹/n+1`

```
     xⁿᐩ¹
xⁿ = ----
     n + 1
```
