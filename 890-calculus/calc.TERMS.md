# Calculus :: Terms

Fundamental concepts of calculus
- limit
- derivatives
- integration

General notions
- Cartesian coordinate system
- function
- graph (of a function)
- secant line
- tangent line
- x-intercept
- y-intercept
- asymptote
  - horizontal asymptote
  - vertical asymptote
  - oblique asymptote


Derivatives
- slope
- rise over run
- line equation, y = mx + b
- slope gradient (steepness, incline)
- slope direction
  - increasing, slope positive
  - decreasing, slope negative
  - horizontal, slope zero
  - vertical,   slope undefined


- slope
- ratio
- rise
- run
- difference between heights (altitudes)
- difference between widths (length)
- ratio of vertical to horizontal change between any two distinct line points
