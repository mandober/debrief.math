     y =   f(x)                      take a derivative of both sides
d/dx y =   f′(x)                     uses mixed notation
dy/dx  =   f′(x)
    dy =   f′(x) dx                  move dx so dx and x are on the same side
∫   dy = ∫ f′(x) dx                  take antiderivative of both sides
∫ 1 dy = ∫ f′(x) dx                  only ∫ needed on right, dx already ∃
     y = ∫ f′(x) dx                  ∫dy is really ∫1dy, so antideriv is y
     y = ∫ f′(x) dx = F′(x) + C      don't forget to add "+ C"
     y =        F′(x) + C
d/dx y =  d/dx (F′(x) + C)
 dy/dx =  d/dx (F′(x) + C)
    dy = (d/dx (F′(x) + C)) dx
    dy =        F′′(x) dx
∫   dy = ∫      F′′(x) dx
     y = ∫ F′′(x) dx
     y = ∫ 𝐅′′(x) dx
