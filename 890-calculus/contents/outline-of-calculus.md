Calculus is a branch of mathematics focused on limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. Calculus can solve many problems for which algebra alone is insufficient. In modern curriculum calculus is known as Real Analysis.

*Calculus*    
In moder use, it is either calculus of analysis, without clear distinction.

*Analysis*
In mathematics, there are several fields with the word "analysis" in them, most of which are either part of calculus or related to it.
- Function Analysis
- Real Analysis
- Complex Analysis
- Infinitesimal Analysis

*Infinitesimal Analysis*     
The name for calculus in older literature.

*Real Analysis*    
Commonly used to distinguish that portion of calculus dealing with real numbers and functions of real variables, as opposed to complex numbers.

*Complex Analysis*    
Commonly used to distinguish that portion of calculus dealing with complex numbers and functions of complex variables, as opposed to real numbers.

*Calculus and Analysis*     
another name for the above with broader portion of calculus included.
