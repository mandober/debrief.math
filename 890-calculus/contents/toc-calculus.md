- increasing function curve ⇔ positive slope
- decreasing function curve ⇔ negative slope
- critical points have slope 0
- extrema
- critical points (critical numbers/values), or stationary points
- second derivative (gives info about extrema of critical points)
- if `f′′(x) > 0` at a critical point, the point is a minimum
- if `f′′(x) < 0` at a critical point, the point is a maximum
- if `f′′(x) = 0` at a critical point, then we can't say and must use
- method of nearby points (to draw conclusions about that critical point)
- relative maximum, absolute maximum
- relative minimum, absolute minimum
- concavity
- point of inflection (point where concavity changes)
- concave up
- concave up means fn is going from neg to pos, so its slope is pos
- while fn is increasing, its derivative is below x-axis (slope is negative), then above it, as the fn starts to decrease - it is concave up
- concave down means fn is going from pos to neg, so its slope is neg
- concave down (convex)
