The term "collection" implies grouping or organization of math objects into some sort of structure, without revealing the structure's details; or, it may be just a generic catch-all term for various mathematical structures.

The term is commonly used as a synonym for a set (where the "collection" denotes the parent, generic, category that has the concrete "set" as one of its subcategories).

When taken to name the generic placeholder, it is usually used as the parent label for the following 4 math collections, each one its subcategory.

basic sorts of grouping that are factorized across two dimensions (!?)
- multiplicity vs uniqueness of elements
- ordered vs unordered collection

Collection | uniqueness   | multiplicity
-----------|--------------|---------------
unordered  | set          | multiset, bag
ordered    | (useless)    | list, sequence
