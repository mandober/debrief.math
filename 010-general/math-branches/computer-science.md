# Computer Science

With the rise of computers, computer science (CS) was born as a field of mathematics, but today, having outgrown its humble beginnings by several orderes of magnintude, CS is more usefully classified as a science on its own. Theoretical CS is still traditionally considered a part of mathematics, having the closest relation to it. Theory of computation is a branch of mathematics that houses the theoretical subjects of computer science, such as computational theory and complexity theory. However, TOC is also repeated in a standalone classification of computer science (which is also the case in these briefings).

## Mathematics and programming languages

Programming languages have started their developement from inside, by respecting and relying on mathematics. They were defined with mathematics in mind, paying attention not to deviate too much from the entrenched mathematical practice. On the other hand, programming languages are very different beast then math. Math is pure; it lives in the mind and it was generally practiced with a pen and paper. The requirements to run mathematics were easily met ("a mind, required; pen and paper, optional"), unlike the requirements needed to run PLs.

Tryied as some PLs might have, …

similar use of symbols…

It was blasphemeous to have a language in which one could write something like `x = x + 1`, as having such an expression in a language was considered distasteful and went against the basic mathematical principle of equality under which the two sides of an equation have cemented that principle throughout the decades of mathematical development - 

the holy status to be equal to the point that either side could stand in for the other in any context.

Thus, some PLs have tried to reconcile this by using different symbols for equality vs assignment (e.g. `x := x + 1` for assignment).


The programming language that best imitates math is probably `Agda`. Purely functional languages are generally better suited for mathematics, providing the similar llok and feel, especially Haskell. However, Agda has a much stringent requiremnts rigor-wise. Proves of everything are necessary.
