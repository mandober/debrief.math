# Reverse mathematics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mathematics

**Reverse mathematics** is a `program` in *mathematical logic* that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics.

Its defining method can briefly be described as "going backwards from the theorems to the axioms", in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. It can be conceptualized as sculpting out necessary conditions from sufficient ones.

Basically, it is the reverse-engineering of theorems.

The reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the *axiom of choice* and *Zorn's lemma* are equivalent over *ZF set theory*.

The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory.

Reverse mathematics is usually carried out using subsystems of *second-order arithmetic*, where many of its definitions and methods are inspired by previous work in *constructive analysis* and *proof theory*.

The use of second-order arithmetic also allows many techniques from *recursion theory* to be employed; many results in reverse mathematics have corresponding results in *computable analysis*.

In *higher-order reverse mathematics*, the focus is on subsystems of *higher-order arithmetic*, and the associated richer language.

The program was founded by Harvey Friedman (1975, 1976) and brought forward by Steve Simpson. A standard reference for the subject is Simpson (2009), while an introduction for non-specialists is Stillwell (2018). An introduction to higher-order reverse mathematics, and also the founding paper, is Kohlenbach (2005).
