Many concepts in math do not bear the name of their inventor but of some person that later worked or further developed the theory.

## Currying
The concept of function currying was invented by Gottlob Frege, then again independetly by Moses Schönfinkel, but it was named after Haskell Curry, even though Curry acknowledged to encountering the concept in a book on combinatory logic written by Schönfinkel. There is a movement to rename it to "freging", or at least to "schönfinkeling", which also has a short form, "finkeling".
- currying = (schön)finkeling
- curryied function = (schön)finkeled function
- schön - sheen - shine
