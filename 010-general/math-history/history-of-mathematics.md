Similarly, there are certain primitive cultures in existence today that have the words in their language to separate small quantities of objects, but resort to words akin to "lots" for more than a few objects. Interestingly enough, some of these cultures have never separated the concept of quantity from quality, a basic step in the birth of mathematics. Their word for "two boats" would have nothing in common with their word for "two bowls". The concept of two is not separated from the quality (boat or bowl) of the object. We have similar primitive words left over in our language today, ie. a gaggle of geese or a pack of dogs, but we have long since abandoned their ties to quantitative quality.

Anyway, eventually humans came to embrace exact large numbers by using place value systems. (This is not historically accurate either).

The Roman numeral system was not a place value system and survived for an incredibly long time, given the fact that calculations done in this system could only be done by highly skilled accountants and philosophers. (The common person could not do much of anything with numbers.) We would assign one position to multiples of one, another position to multiples of some number b called the base, and so on. Today, we use ten as the base of our number system, but other bases were used throughout history. An artifact of this is most of our time concepts being based in base 60 (Babylonians). Every time more than 60 seconds passes, we increment the next place value (the minute) and reset the "seconds place" to 0.


The ability to count *whole numbers* of objects was great for money management or keeping track of your livestock, but philosophers needed a more flexible concept of quantity. They needed a way to compare two quantities to each other beyond simply saying one was larger and the other was smaller. How much larger was very important to natural philosophy.

These *ratios* and the inevitable need to do arithmetic with them evolved into the system of *rational numbers*.

The study of *geometry* profited greatly from the application of rational numbers. Now, one could use any *fraction* of an existing measurement necessary to describe the length or size of a geometric object.

For years, it had been known that one could easily construct a right angle by using a closed rope with 12 equally spaced knots and stretching out a triangle from this rope so that the hypotenuse had exactly 5 spacings between the knots and one of the legs had 3 spacings. The Egyptians made use of this simple tool to construct right angles in their architecture and fields.

## The First Sign of Trouble: Irrational Numbers in Geometry

Philosophers during this period (and beforehand) explored many applications of the relationship that is now known as the Pythagorean theorem. It made perfect sense to them that every possible length should be able to be expressed as, at the least, a fraction of some whole amount.

This can easily be argued without looking too deep. If you take a pencil and draw a line, then label that line with equally spaced whole numbers (we'll call this line "the number line"), then no matter where you place a point on that line, you should always be able to label it as being x times closer to 1 than to, say 2. It might not be a nice fraction like 1‚ÅÑ4, but it should still be a fraction. After all, between every two rational numbers there was an infinitude of rational numbers. What other type of numbers could there there be?

Archimedes property (?)
If `a` and `b` are rational numbers with `a < b`, then there is always a rational number `c` such that `a < c < b`.
