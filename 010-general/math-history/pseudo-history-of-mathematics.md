# Pseudo-history of mathematics

A pseudo-history of mathematics is a romanticized take on the actual history. It is a straightforward and logical sequence of events where the previous events inspire the subsequent ones, and every development follows logically, building upon the ones that came before.

However, it seldom coincides with the way how things actually occured. The true timeline of mathematical discoveries (or creations?) is a more random and far more complex story where events almost never occur in a logical order.
