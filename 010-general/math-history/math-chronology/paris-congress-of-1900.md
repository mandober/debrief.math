1900 International Congress of Mathematicians - Paris, France

The International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Paris, France from 6 August to 12 August 1900. The Congress was attended by 250 full members.

In many ways it was David Hilbert's lecture on the future problems of mathematics which became the most famous lecture delivered at any International Congress of Mathematicians. It is sometimes described as a plenary lecture and sometime it is not. We explain why there is a confusion. Hilbert was invited to give a plenary lecture at the 1900 Congress. He could not decide on a topic and discussed what he should talk on with Hermann Minkowski and Adolf Hurwitz. Eventually he decided to discuss outstanding mathematical problems but took a long time to write his lecture. The programme for the 1900 Congress was published before he had things ready and so his talk was not advertised as a plenary lecture. It was delivered at the Congress in a joint session of the Teaching Section and of the History Section. By the time the Proceedings of the conference appeared the organisers decided that, because of its importance, they would put Hilbert's paper in the section with the plenary lectures. Another point worth making is that, because of lack of time, Hilbert only spoke about 10 of his 23 problems in the lecture although all 23 appear in the published paper. Most of this Congress was in French, but there was a discussion about the problems of mathematics being published in such a diverse number of languages.
