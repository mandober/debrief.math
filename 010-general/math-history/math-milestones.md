Euclid (/ˈjuːklɪd/; Ancient Greek: Εὐκλείδης; fl. 300 BC) was an ancient Greek mathematician active as a geometer and logician. Considered the "father of geometry", he is chiefly known for the Elements treatise, which established the foundations of geometry that largely dominated the field until the early 19th century. His system, now referred to as Euclidean geometry, involved innovations in combination with a synthesis of theories from earlier Greek mathematicians. The *Elements* (Ancient Greek: Στοιχεῖα Stoikheîa) is a mathematical treatise consisting of 13 books attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid c. 300 BC. It is a collection of definitions, postulates, propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. The books cover plane and solid Euclidean geometry, elementary number theory, and incommensurable lines. Elements is the oldest extant large-scale deductive treatment of mathematics. It has proven instrumental in the development of logic and modern science, and its logical rigor was not surpassed until the 19th century.



*Cartesian Geometry*

Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorems, WMDs, ~1920. Math's killer theorem. "Math" is either incomplete or inconsistent. Murdered the Hilbert's dream and crushed a buch more people's spirits and hopes in the absoluteness of mathematical truth. Many a mathematicians felt ill. Manic depression and a couple of world wars.


Our modern system of *positional decimal notation with zero*, together with the basic arithmetic computational schemes, which were discovered in India about 500 CE.

Around the 5th century CE, the Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata used a *symbol for zero* in his astronomical calculations. However, it was Brahmagupta, another Indian mathematician, who formalized the use of *zero* in 628 CE. The prior absence of zero created difficulty in carrying out simple calculations. Following this in the 7th century a man known as Brahmagupta, developed the earliest known methods for using zero within calculations, treating it as a number for the first time.

In mathematics, *zero is even*. Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics: the abstraction of a familiar concept to an unfamiliar setting.

The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of *π* was a geometrical approach using polygons, devised around 250 BC by the Greek mathematician Archimedes, implementing the method of exhaustion.

Leonhard Euler introduced *the notation sigma for summation* in 1755. He also introduced *e* for the base of the natural logarithm, π for the ratio of the circumference to diameter of a circle, and *i* for the square root of -1.

*Calculus* is commonly accepted to have been created twice, independently, by two of the 17. century's brightest minds: Sir Isaac Newton of gravitational fame, and the philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz.
