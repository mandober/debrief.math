# Timeline of mathematics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_mathematics

This is a timeline of pure and applied mathematics history. It is divided here into 3 stages, corresponding to stages in the development of mathematical notation: a *"rhetorical" stage* in which calculations are described purely by words, a *"syncopated" stage* in which quantities and common algebraic operations are beginning to be represented by symbolic abbreviations, and finally a *"symbolic" stage*, in which comprehensive notational systems for formulas are the norm.

The earliest event is dated at ~70,000 BCE: in South Africa, Ochre rocks adorned with scratched geometric patterns (see [Blombos Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blombos_Cave)). Next event is dated between ~35,000 BCE and 20,000 BCE: in Africa and today's France, earliest known prehistoric attempts to quantify time. Next event is ~20,000 BCE: in Nile Valley "Ishango bone", possibly the earliest reference to prime numbers and Egyptian multiplication.

After this 3 sporadic events, next 10 events take place in the period from 3400 BCE to 1650 BCE.
