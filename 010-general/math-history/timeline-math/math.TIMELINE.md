The timeline of math is divided here into 3 stages corresponding to the stages in the development of mathematical notation:
- rhetorical, before 1000 BCE 
  calculations are described only verbally
- syncopated, 1000 BCE - 1000 CE 
  symbolic notation for quantities and arithmetic
- symbolic, from 1000 CE 
  comprehensive notational systems for formulas is the standard
