# zero-is-even

Turns out people find it hard to accept that 0 is an even number. This is very curious since those people have no problem with `√-1 = i` and `0⁰ = 1`, a slew of different infinities, axiom of choice, …, but the parity of zero is what they take as issue and draw the line. "We simply won't stand for it". "It feels unnatural", as if nature has anything to do with it. It is what it was defined to be, as was agreed upon by the math people at the right time. Reason's got nothing to do with it. It's abstract abstraction. *Definitions aim to please theorems not people* [noice!] (just ask number one how it feels about its eviction from the prime club). Perhaps it's because it's the issue they are certain they understand, so they feel they have a stake in it. Skin in the game.
