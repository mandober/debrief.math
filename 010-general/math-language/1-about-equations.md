# Equation

A **mathematical equation** 
is a *mathematical formula* (string of symbols) 
that expresses the *equality* (equality relation) 
of two *mathematical expressions* (wffs, units of meaning) 
by connecting them with the *equals sign* (`=`) 

*Mathematical expressions* are assembled to form mathematical statements. Math statements are on a higher linguistic level, corresponding to sentences, while expressions are like phrases and clauses in sententes. Math symbols are like letters. Symbols are grouped into expessions, which are also like words.

Units of meaning by size (and granularity)
- symbols (elements of an alphabet)
- strings (sequences of symbols)
- formulas (sequences of symbols)
- well-formed formulas (sequences of symbols assembled according to the grammar)
- expession (string or group of strings, still not a complete statement)
- statement, assertion, proposition
  - composed of expessions
  - has truth value
- theorem
- theory


In general, a *formal language* consists of a finite set of *symbols* (also called *letters*, especially in natural languages, although natlangs are not formal langs) arranged in an *alphabet*. Symbols can be sequenced and assembled in an infinite number of ways, producing *sequances*, most of which will be utter gibberish (either syntactically or semantically, or both). A *grammar* determines which sequances are *syntactically legal*. Such sequances are called *strings* or *formulas* or even *words* (esp. in natlangs). Strictly, "formula" is synonymous with a sequence, as in being potential nonsense, while the term *well-formed formula* (wff) is reserved for legal sequances. Typically, however, legal sequances are called strings, words, formulas, wffs; there is seldom a need to discuss illegal sequances, so it's understood these terms refer to wffs ("woofs"). Some also reserve the term "words" for strings that are both synactically legal and meaningful (semantically sound). 

Loosely, strings make a formula (wff). Formulas make an expression or statement. But expession are also parts of a statement. It is not straightforward to tell apart a formula from expession; sometimes a formula is an *expression*, soemtimes an expession consists of multiple formulas. Formulas can also make a *statement*. Yet, somehow, a statement may be composed of multiple expessions, similar to how sentences in a natlang consist of *phrases* and *clauses* (units), but also of words (smaller units), and even of other sentences (bigger units).

Anyway, an equation relates two expressions, but as a whole an equation is a statement, aka assertion or proposition, in that it has a truth value.

>Equations are propositions; they have a truth value.

`1 + 2 = 3` is a simple equation whose truth value is "true".

On the other hand, expressions do not have a truth value; even `1 + 2` is neither true nor false, let alone something like, `x + 1`. This example shows that expressions may possibly be evaluated. An expession may be evaluated as much as possible, all the way down to a value (constant), or only a few steps.

It is difficult to define what a *value* is. A value is a concrete number, in which case it is often called a *constant*, but soemtimes even a variable may be considered a value. *Variables* do represent values usually. Variables typically range over number sets, so saying something like: let `x` be an integer may be translated formally as `∀x(x ∈ ℤ)`. This is an expression - not a complete statement. A complete statement would involve some logical connectives and shit, e.g. `∀x(x ∈ ℕ ∧ x even ⇒ 2∣x)`. This example is typical in that a language of formal logic (first-order logic, FOL) is mixed with mathematical symbols (`|` means "divides" i.e. "is divisible by").





mathematical expressions
- possibly evaluated: by a step or down to a value (constant)

 that carry a (compund) meaning. An *expression* is a string of symbols assembled according to the rules of a formal language that carries a meaning. Mathematical *statements* are comprised of math expessions


  - `x + 1`
- mathematical statement: `x + 1 = 2`, `|r| < 1`
- mathematical statement: 


- strict inequality, `≠`
- strict inequality, `<` less-then
- strict inequality, `>` greater-then
- loose inequality, `≤` less-then-or-equal-to
- loose inequality, `≥` greater-then-or-equal-to


- a = b EQUALS SIGN
- a ≠ b
- a ≤ b
- a < b
- a > b
- a ≥ b
- a ≮ b
- a ≯ b



- equations express equality relations using
  - the main equality relation which employs the equals sign, `a = b`
  - the less-then-or-equals-to sign, `a ≤ b`
  - the greater-then-or-equals-to sign, `a ≥ b`
- inequation uses an inequality relation and different signs
  - `a ≠ b` not equal
  - `a < b` less then
  - `a ≤ b` less then or equal to
  - `a > b` greater then
  - `a ≥ b` greater then or equal to



An equation is a mathematical assertion (statement) that expresses the relation of equality between its two sides, called the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs), `lhs = rhs`.

As a mathematical assertion, an equation is posed as a true proposition, but, upon checking, it may turn out it is not. This situation is usually called attention to, as in e.g. exercises; normally, though, equations are supposed to expressed true propositions.

Mathematical statements can be expressed using the relation of inequality and such statements are called *inequations* or *inequalities*. Unlike the equality relation which can only be expressed using the equals sign, `=`, there is a number of inequalities (inequality relations). The direct negation of equality is inequality expressed with the not-equals sign, `≠`. However, there are 4 others: `≤`, `<`, `>`, `≥`.


An **inequation** is a mathematical assertion (statement) that conveys an inequality of some kind (becasue there are several) using one of the inequality relations.
