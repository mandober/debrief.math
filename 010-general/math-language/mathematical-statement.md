# Mathematical statement

The *expression* `m/n` is a term denoting the *number* obtained by dividing `m`
 by `n`. Thus `12/3` denotes 4 and `12/5` denotes the number 2.4.

The *expression* `m|n` is an *assertion* that "m divides n with no remainder". So for example "3|12", read "3 divides 12" or "12 is a multiple of 3", is a true statement and "5|12" is a false statement.

Notice that `m/n` is an integer if and only if `n|m`. Not only is m/n a number and n|m a statement, but the statement "the first one is an integer if and only if the second one is true" is correct only after the m and n are switched.
