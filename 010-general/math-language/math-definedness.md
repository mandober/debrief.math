# Mathematics :: Mathematiquette :: Articles and definiteness

English has 4 articles that mark the definiteness of a noun phase (NP), 
here in order from the least to the most definite article: 
`◌`, `a(n)`, `the`, `∅`.

The articles `a(n)` and `the` are the standard and familiar articles that mark an indefinite noun phase and definite noun phase, respectively. However, this is incomplete because in each case there is an additional article.

The two "empty" articles are both written as the empty string, ε, but logically they stand on the opposite sides of the definiteness spectrum.

If we use the symbol `⊑` to mean definiteness, `◌` to stand for zero article and `∅` to stand for null article, then the *definiteness relation* between the 4 articles is:

`◌ ⊑ a(n) ⊑ the ⊑ ∅`

- The zero       article `◌`    marks indefinite NPs
- The indefinite article `a(n)` marks indefinite NPs
- The definite   article `the`  marks definite NPs
- The null       article `∅`    marks definite NPs

The zero article, `◌`, marks NPs that are even more indefinite than those marked with `a(n)`. The null article, `∅`, marks NPs that are even more definite than those marked with `the`.

The existence of the empty-string article, `ε` (sometimes called the null article, but generally different from the null article discussed here, so let's denote it `ε`) is perhaps not too unknown. However, the linguistic research has shown that there are actually two such articles - the two extremes on the definiteness spectrum.

As if the pedestrian dillema between *the* and *a(n)* wasn't difficult enough at times, the choice with the `ε` added into the mix made it into an NP hard problem (at least for the non-native speakers), but now the split of `ε` into two new, completely opposing polarities, `◌` and `∅`, has turn this into an unsolvable task even for the natives. ⟨Warning: once you are aware of this, if anal, you get to examine your every sentence ad nauseum⟩. Quadruply so because there is the standard English ortography, and then there are accapted norms for writing technical texts. ⟨Fortuntelly, these norms are quite forgiving, particularly for mathematical essays. Most of the time you can just drop the articles and get away with it⟩.


The zero article should mark the most indefinite noun phrases and it is weaker than "a(n)". Usually, this is the role that the empty article had before. It marks uncountable NPs. A lot of mathematical NPs take the sero article, especially in definitions. For example, *"Generalization is …"* vs *"A generalization is …"*.

Articles                    | Count | Noncount
----------------------------|-------|-----------
specific identity not known | a/an  | ◌
specific identity known     | the   | the
things in general           | ◌     | ◌
well-known NPs              | the   | ∅
