# Math :: Commons :: Mathematical Formula

In general, a formula is an element of syntax consisting of symbols and *formation rules* of the ambient *formal language*.

A formal language, like a formal language of first-order logic, has several parts, one of which is a finite set of symbols known as alphabet.

- symbol, sign, letter, character
- symbols are collected into an alphabet
- alphabet is a finite set of symbols, usually with an imposed ordering
- strictly, formula is any sequence of symbols, also called a string
- but any random sequence of symbols cannot possibly be valid
- grammar determines which sequences of symbols are valid
- valid sequences of symbols are called *well-formed formulas* (wffs)
- usually, however, "formula" is used in this sense, as a wff
- "word" is a valid sequance of symbols that are letters
- in the narrow sense, "string" also means a valid sequance of symbols
- in the narrow sense, "string", "word", "formula" are all wffs
- formulas are combined into expressions and statements
- in a sense, expressions are elements of a statement
- most of these smaller entities are subsets of larger entities, especially since any set is a subset of itself
