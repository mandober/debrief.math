How is mathematics expressed? How are its concepts conveyed? Is there such a thing as the language of mathematics?

First-order logic (FOL) is a (formal) language used throughout math, but its main purpose is to express axioms, definitions, properties, not for writing mathematical expressions.

Mathematical expressions are written as equations, so using a "language of equations". But is there such a thing? What are then inequations expressed in? Or inequalities?

In math, an **equation** is a *mathematical formula* that establishes a relation of *equality* over *mathematical expressions* by connecting them with the equls sign.

"Mathematical formula" says about the same as "mathematical expression" or "mathematical statement". There is a feeling that "expressions" are parts of a "formula", as is the case outside math. A possible interpretation of "mathematical statement" is that it is the same content expressed as prose (possibly interspersed with mathematical expressions).

  - `=` (EQ), `≠` (NE)
  - `≤` (LE), `<` (LT)
  - `≥` (GE), `>` (GT)
  - identity
    - identical
    - identity sign (≡)
  - equality
    - equals sign (`=`)
    - equals
  - equivalence, `≅`
  - similarity, `~`, similar
  - dissimilarity, `≁`, disimilar
  - approximately equal
  - almost equal
  - judgemental equality
  - definitional equality, `≝`, definitionally equal
  - propositional equality, `≡`, propositionally equal
  - congruence, `≡`, `≅`
  - isomorphism, `≅`
  - inequality, non-equality, unequals sign (`≠`), 
  - inequalities `{≤, <, ≥, >}`
  - symbols (signs)
