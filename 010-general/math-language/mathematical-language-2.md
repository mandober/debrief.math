mathematical content and intent


*Mathematical symbols* are components of mathematical syntax that represent and rely mathematical content, just like words of a natural language. Similarly to the letters of an alphabet, mathematical symbols are arbitrary, so being able to interpret them requires obtaining mathematical education, similarly to learning a new language. That mathematical symbols are arbitrary means they were chosen arbitrarily since a symbol by itself cannot convey any meaning (such associations are learned); however, they now have a fixed meaning (some even have several). Mathematical symbols can designate numbers (constants), variables, operations, functions, punctuation, grouping and other syntactic aspects.

*Mathematical content* may be expressed *formally*, using mathematical symbols to convey the meaning even across cultures (provided the consumers have acquired knowledge required to interpret them correctly). Formal mathematical expression suggest written mathematical exposition consisting mostly of mathematical symbols with a minimal amount of prose. However, this is rarely encountered; almost all such expositions are conveyed *semi-informally*, using a mix of mathematical symbols interspersed with descriptions in some natural language. Sometimes, the entire exposition is expressed in a natural language, minimizing the use of symbols, often in an *informal style*. Describing things in a natural language is called *prose*. Generally, the prose designates those parts of a mathematical content without the mathematical symbols, usually the bits written in e.g. English.

It cannot be said that math has an offical, standardized formal languges; hell, half of math symbols lack a meaning. People cannot agree on the meaning of particulaur symbols let alone on a whole language. This is why the formal mathematical syntax varies wildly across different authors. Even the same author may endow a differnt meaning to symbols on separate occasions. However, the meaning of dubious symbols must be established per context, and there are still many symbols that do have a universal interpretation.

In a formal language of mathematics (whateveer that may be), mathematical content consists of mathematical statements and mathematical expressions.

*Mathematical expression* is a combination of mathematical symbols that is well-formed according to the agreed-upon rules that are mosrly uniform but can depend on the context.

* Many authors distinguish an expression from a formula.
- *mathematical expression* denotes a mathematical object
- *mathematical formula* denotes a statement about mathematical objects
For example, 8x−5 is an expression, while 8x−5 ≥ 5x−8 is a formula. 

* However, in modern mathematics, particularly in computer algebra, *formulas* are viewed as *expressions* that can be evaluated to true or false, depending on the values that are given to the variables occurring in the expressions. For example, 8x−5 ≥ 5x−8 takes the value false if `x` is given a value less than -1, and the value true otherwise.


If math symbols are atoms, mathematical expressions are molecules that combine into compounds that are math statements.

Mathematical symbols combine to make mathematical expressions, which are parts of mathematical statements that often also include prose.


`m/n` is a *mathematical expression* resulting in an integer, while `n|m` is a *mathematical statement* resulting in a truth value.


The "official" language of mathematics is *first-order logic* (FOL). FOL is a formal logic system. Actually, it is a family of formal systems with slight variations because there is no "one" system. There are numerous system that share a set of common, mostly fixed, rules with some paripheral aspects left underdetermined. Author are expected to fix such aspects when they define or describe a particular system.

Math abounds with FOL statements expressed either as prose or as formulas.

The result of math content (expressions and statements) can vary. For example, `m/n` denotes the operation of division where `m` and `n` are variables. However, we don't know which set these variables range over - that must be established by the context. Sometimes, such questions are resolved by trying differnt numberic sets in order (ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ) and going with the first that works. This time, we'll explicitly set the range to integers, so `m/n` denotes the *integer division* which only retruns the whole part of the quotient, disregarding the potential remained. On the other hand, a similar piece of syntax `n|m` denotes *divisibility*, which is not a number but a property related to a pair of integers. Thus, `n|m` does not produce a number like `m/n` but a truth value. Therefore it is a math statement, more precisely a *mathematical proposition*.

**Mathematical statement** is an *assertion* or *proposition*, usually expressed in the language of FOL, whose value is a truth values (true or false).

**The language of mathematics** is an extension of a natural language used when describing mathematical knowledge, like equations, formulas, laws, proofs, and in similar discourse when a concise but precise, and above all, unambiguous language is required.


*Mathematical object* are like nouns (i.e. subjects and objects) that are manipulated by verbs (i.e. predicates) like mathematical operations, and descussed and described using
