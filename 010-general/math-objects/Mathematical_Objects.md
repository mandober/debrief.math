## Prologue

>Mathematics consists of true facts about imaginary objects.
-- P. Davis and R. Hersh


We know, of course, that a rectangle is not a physical object like a house, and the number 42 is not a person. Nevertheless, these facts about how we talk about math objects show how we think about them. We talk about math objects in these ways because we think of them as things, although not as physical things.

Remember, I am discussing how we think and talk about mathematical objects, not what they really are.

- Rowena: "111 is not a prime. It is divisible by 37."
- Eudora: "Well my stars, you're right. I never noticed that."

- Eudora: "That tree must be ten feet tall".
- Rowena: "It can't be that short, it's taller than the two-story house next to it."

>We expect that there is always an explanation of an apparent contradiction in math, even if we cannot find it.

## Types and properties

>Mathematical objects have different types and various properties.

One type of mathematical object is [integer][1], another is [real number][2]. The number 42 is both an integer and a real number. The number π is a real number but not an integer. A type of object can be named by a noun or [noun phrase][3].

The number 42 has the _property_ of being even. The number 43 is an integer but not an even integer. Both numbers have the property that they are greater than 40. Thus properties can be named by adjectives ("even") or adjective phrases ("greater than 40").

>The ideas of type and property are not really different.

You could define a type of mathematical object called "ent" to denote an even integer, and another type "ont" to denote odd integers. Then you could say "42 is an ent" using the same grammar as when you say "42 is an integer". So although we think of "integer" as a _type_ of thing and "even" as a _property_ of things, calling even integers "ents" allows us to think of even integers as a type.

Your mental image of "type" may be that it is a more permanent and intrinsic thing than "property". (Being human is a type, but being red-headed is a property). This distinction is not important when thinking rigorously about math because in [rigorous mode][4], math objects are thought of as *inert and unchanging*.


## Constructors

>Math objects can be constructed from other math objects by many different procedures.

- integers 1, 2 and 4 are math objects, and from them you can construct the set {1,2,4}.
- You can construct the [ordered pair][5] (1,2) from the numbers 1 and 2.
- From those same numbers you can construct another ordered pair (2,1) and a bunch of ordered triples such as (1,2,1).
- For any given set you can construct its set of subsets. For example, the set {∅,{1},{2},{1,2}} is the set of subsets of {1,2}.

## Objects, processes and relationships

A math object is like a physical object in that you can do things to it.
- you can add 77 to itself, getting 154
- you can take the derivative of the function `x³`, getting `3x²`

You cannot do most operations to every object, though.
- you can add 77 to itself but you can't add a triangle to itself.
- you can't take the derivative of the function defined by:

    F(x) = 1 if x is rational
           0 if x is irrational

more about the *Dirichlet function* [here][6]

You can perform more complicated operations involving several objects
- you can nail a birdhouse to a tree
- you can add 42 and 63
- you can calculate `∫ 353x² dx = 98`, which means applying the process of calculating the definite integral to 3 objects: two numbers (3 and 5), and one [function][7], `x ↦ 3x²`.


Math objects can have various relationships with each other
- 42 is less than 63
- Two triangles may or may not be [congruent][8]. 
- If they are not congruent, they may or may not be [similar][9]

## What is a mathematical object?

"I am myself and my circumstances".   
-- [José Ortega y Gasset][10].


As I said at the top of this chapter, I am not going to talk about what math objects are, but how you should think about them.

Example

The number 42 is an object about which you know a bunch of things:
- it is called "42" in decimal notation and "101010" in binary notation
- it is an [integer][11]
- it is divisible by 2
- it is one more than 41
- you can add, subtract and multiply it by other numbers

In other words, you know some of its _properties_, some _operations_ you can apply to it, and some _relations_ it has with other objects. That is all you ever need to know about a math object. "What it is" is irrelevant.

All you can know about a math object is its properties, 
the operations (processes) you can apply to it, 
and its relations with other math objects. 
There is nothing else to know.

## Abstract objects

### Interactive abstract objects

There are other kinds of _abstract objects_ besides math objects. I will give some examples here. But note: you can get carried away and write books about abstract objects and classify them in all sorts of ways. You may think I have got carried away a bit too much here!

- "September" is an abstract object with a [proper name][12]. It certainly is not a physical object. Its properties change over time (sometimes "this month is September" is true and sometimes it is false) and it affects what people do (some of us have to go back to school). Neither of these is true of mathematical objects (see [rigorous][13])

- A "schedule" is an abstract object. When we think about our schedule for Wednesday afternoon, it may be represented as a physical piece of handwriting, or as a bunch of [pits][14] on our hard disk (which if we push the right buttons becomes characters for us to read on a screen), or it may be only in our mind. The schedule is an abstract object with possible physical representations, and we refer to it as we refer to physical objects. We say "my schedule" and "I need to make a schedule". A schedule is not a mathematical object: it affects what people do and it changes over time.

### Fictional objects

I am using the word "object" in the philosophical sense of *object of thought*. Such a thing can be animate or inanimate.

A unicorn is a _fictional object_. We may talk about them as if they are real physical objects, and we think of them as having many of the properties of physical objects.

A unicorn has a horn in the middle of its forehead, allows only virgins to ride it, and has cloven hooves. If you show a picture of a supposed unicorn that shows horse-type non-split hooves to certain types of fantasy fans, they will object strongly and say, "That's wrong! Unicorns have cloven hooves!"

But what does that mean? Why not define unicorns any way you want, since they are not real? Answer: For the same reason we must not define π to be equal to 3: The meaning of the symbol π and the concept of unicorn are part of our common culture (at least the common culture of the intersection of fantasy fans and mathematicians) and we violate our expectations and confuse people if we use these symbols and words with other meanings.

The preceding paragraph is controversial. Many mathematicians would say you certainly may define "unicorn" to be anything you want. Some of them redefine common terminology in mathematics books they write. Those books are very confusing to read.

Another type of fictional object is a character in a book, for example Sherlock Holmes. The source of information we have about Sherlock Holmes is the set of stories Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about him.

What math objects, abstract objects and fictional objects have in common
- Each one corresponds to a physical arrangement in our brain that connects the concept to certain properties, relationships with other objects, and expectations of behaviors.
- Each one is talked about using many of the same grammatical constructions as for physical objects. We use proper nouns to refer to them. We say:
  - "42 is an even number."
  - "September has thirty days."
  - "Darth Vader wears a ventilator."

We also refer to them using common nouns:
- "An integer is even if it is divisible by 2."
- "A month has at least 28 days."
- "A unicorn has cloven hooves."

- You can experiment with coming up with sentences in which each type of object is referred to as the object of a verb, the object or a preposition, and so on.
- This suggests that these concepts are all stored and manipulated in the brain in the same way words denoting physical objects are.

### References

The idea of distinguishing between abstract objects and math objects and in particular the schedule example are from [What is Mathematics, Really?][17] by Reuben Hersh.

## Foundational aspects

Sometimes, when asked about how they think about an object, a mathematician will give a description of the object based on some particular construction used in the study of the [foundations of mathematics][20]. Such constructions are useful for showing that some part of math is consistent if some other more primitive part is. However, in my opinion they are not usually much help in studying the particular object.

#### Example

It is common in texts on foundations to define each kind of mathematical object as a special kinds of set. For example, the ordered pair (a,b) may be defined to be the set {{a},{a,b}}. This has technical importance in foundations, but it is totally misleading to say things such as "The first coordinate of (a,b) is {a}".

[Wikipedia][21] has an illuminating discussion of how ordered pairs have been defined.

#### Specification for ordered pairs

All we need to know about the ordered pair (a,b) is that if two ordered pairs are equal, then their first coordinates are equal and their second coordinates are equal. So for example, if (a,b) = (c,d), then a=c and b=d. For example, (1,3) ≠ (2,3) because 1≠2. That is essentially the definition of "ordered pair" in [homotopy type theory][22], a proposed system for providing a foundation for math other than set theory.

#### Example

Usually, a mathematician will simply talk about the number 2 as if it were a specific individual that we are all familiar with. That is because that is the way a mathematician thinks about it.

For purposes of foundations, the natural numbers may be defined by the [Peano axioms][23]. It is correct to say that in that axiom system, 2 may be defined by saying that it is something like "the successor of the successor of 0." Other axiom systems define 2 in other ways. It is wrong to say that what 2 really is (its "true inner essence") is the successor of the successor of 0.

#### Two controversial statements:

What mathematicians say about math when they philosophize about it is (in my opinion) not necessarily trustworthy.
