# Mathematical object

Mathematical objects come into existence by definitions which should give a complete description of the object. The objects don't require a proof, merely an introduction through defnition.

**Mathematical object** is anything that can be formally defined and used in deductive reasoning and mathematical proof.

Common mathematical objects include permutations, combinations, partitions, relations, theorems, even proofs themselves.

With set theory (ZFC) at the foundation of mathematics, mathematical objects are defined in terms of sets.

**Discrete Structures** aid us in modelling the world in a way that enables us to think about it rigorously and computationally.


**Modelling** is used to approximate objects and concepts by identifying and encoding patterns in the data.


**Mathematical structure** on a set is an additional structural object that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set, endowing it with some extra meaning or significance. Structure-preserving relations map structures in domain to equivalent structures in codomain: **homomorphisms** preserve algebraic structures, **homeomorphisms** preserve topological structures, **diffeomorphisms** preserve differential structures.


Since computers operate on discrete bits of data, Discrete Mathematics overlaps with Computer Science in its study of:
- algorithms
- algorithmic complexity
- proofs
- formal language
- automata
- computability
- correctness of programming languages
- automated and assisted theorem proving

Solving a problem computationally requires
- modeling the world
- devising an algorithm
- determining its efficiency and correctness

A mathematical object is an abstract object arising in mathematics. 
The concept is studied in philosophy of mathematics.

**Mathematical object** is anything that can be formally defined and used in deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. In modern math, most mathematical objects are defined in terms of sets.

Mathematical objects:
- permutations
- combinations
- partitions
- relations
- functions
- proofs
- theorems


**Discrete Structures** aid us in modelling the world in a way that enables us to think about it rigorously and computationally.

**Mathematical statements** have their own moderately complex taxonomy, being divided into:
- axioms
- conjectures
- theorems
- lemmas
- corollaries


An **axiom** or **postulate** is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.

A **conjecture** is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof or disproof has yet been found. Conjectures such as the `Riemann hypothesis` (still a conjecture) or `Fermat's Last Theorem` (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.

A **theorem** is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement.

A **lemma** is a proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a statement of interest by itself.

A **corollary** is a statement that readily follows from a previous statement or proof.
