## Socio-mathematics

Mathematics. ü§ì Oh, how sweet the sound. Certain class of older, white and privileged people will be the first to lauch into a romantic tyrade about purity, rigor and ultimate truth. How numbers never lie and how math doesn't care if you're rich or poor, black or white, man or woman for it only cares about whether you can do the work correctly. What a bunch of bollony! üë∫

Mathematics is a boy's club. Membership requires mysogeny, racism, doublethink, doublespeak, patronizing, brown-nosing, gaslighting, and enourmous amounts of hypocrisy, for (socially) members must hide this under the rug of independence, truth and rigor (which it objectively requires); for its scientific values (which is unquestionable, but social mathematics is very questionable).


Mathematicins - frequently grumpy, usually older, permanently white, infinitely righteous, and constantly men - have long ago restricted access, curb the influence, consolidating the moderation power to a select few groups. Mathematics in academia is a clan formed around a tight, inscrupulus core of intollerant geezers harder to penetrate then cosa nostra. Methods are similar so new ideas are killed with a quickness of a loathing ridicule with their authors tared'n'feathered in a blitzkrieg smear campaign. Many a set theorist have been painted as a corruptor of youth, the devil himself. üëø The sect prevails, keeping the set of modest enthusiasts and the privileged pairwise disjoint. Your theory may cure cancer as a side-effect, but it won't be ackowedged, no, it won't be read, no - no peer review for you! ü•∫ If you insist, you'll get bitch-slapped in a cross-fire hurricane by the nastiest clique of bearded teethless hags who won't hesitate to put a spike right through your head.

In conclusion: mathematics good, but mathematicians terrible. It takes far more then honest inspirational work to make it. The work does not speak for itself unless the reception was oiled up. Women are mistreated as a hobby.

* Math ‚Ñö ‚Ñù ‚ÑÇ

* Socio-mathematics is a white boy's club for the racist priviledged geezers that radiate mysogeny, and doublespeak down at their brown-nosing younger colleagues, gaslighting. The members frolick about hilberting the slogans like "mathematics knows no races or geographic boundaries; for mathematics, the cultural world is one country", poincaring second to none while profusely pouring acid on the foot you forced at the door, "Be gone, ye corrupter of youth!", kronecketeering insidiously. "Meine Herren, der Senat ist doch keine Badeanstalt!". Noether off.

* Worse yet, Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor's former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor's work ever since he had intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor's first major publication in 1874.
