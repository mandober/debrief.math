**Mathematical notation** consists of symbols for representing mathematical objects and assembling them into expressions and formulas.

Mathematical notation is widely used in mathematics for denoting complex concepts in a concise, unambiguous and accurate way.

Mathematical notation was first introduced by François Viète at the end of the 16th century and largely expanded during the 17th and 18th centuries by René Descartes, Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and overall Leonhard Euler.
