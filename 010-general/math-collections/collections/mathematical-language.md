The language of mathematics (mathematical language) is an extension of a natural language that is used to express results (laws, theorems, proofs) with concision, precision and unambiguity.

## Features

The main features of mathematical language
- Use of common words with a derived meaning, which is generally more specific and more precise. For example, a "line" is straight and has zero width.
- Use of common words with a meaning that is completely different from their common meaning (ring, real, imaginary).
- Use of neologisms (polynomial, homomorphism)
- Use of symbols as words or phrases (A = B, ∀x)

- Use of formulas as part of sentences (E=mc² is mass-energy equivalence). A formula that is not included in a sentence is generally meaningless, since the meaning of the symbols may depend on the context: in ⁠ E =mc², this is the context that specifies that E is the energy of a physical body, m is its mass, and c is the speed of light.

- Use of phrases that cannot be decomposed into their components. In particular, adjectives do not always restrict the meaning of the corresponding noun, and may change the meaning completely. For example, most algebraic integers are not integers and integers are specific algebraic integers. So, an algebraic integer is not an integer that is algebraic.

- Use of mathematical jargon that consists of phrases that are used for informal explanations or shorthands. For example, "killing" is often used in place of "replacing with zero", and this led to the use of "assassinator" and "annihilator" as technical words.

## Understanding mathematical text

The consequence of these features is that a mathematical text is generally not understandable without some prerequisite knowledge. 

For example, the sentence "a free module is a module that has a basis" is perfectly correct, although it appears only as a grammatically correct nonsense, when one does not know the definitions of basis, module, and free module.
