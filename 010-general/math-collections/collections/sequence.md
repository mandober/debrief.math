# Sequence

A *sequence* is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters.

Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the length of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter.

Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function from natural numbers (the positions of elements in the sequence) to the elements at each position. The notion of a sequence can be generalized to an indexed family, defined as a function from an arbitrary index set.

The position of an element in a sequence is its rank or index; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. 

In mathematical analysis, a sequence is often denoted by letters, like `aₙ`, where the subscript `n` refers to the `n`th element of the sequence; for example, the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence `F` is generally denoted as `Fₙ`.

In computing and computer science, *finite sequences* are sometimes called *strings* (words) or *lists*, and these different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in computer memory. *Infinite sequences* are called *streams*. The empty sequence `()` is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.
