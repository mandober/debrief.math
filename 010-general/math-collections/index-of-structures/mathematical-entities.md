Anything and everything encountered in mathematics is a *mathematical object*, or just *object*. "Mathematical object" is just a generic label, a collective noun for anything that we can speak of in mathematics.

Some authors worry the term "object", even in this highly abstact setting, still maintains some conotation to physical objects of the real world, so they replace it with an even more abstract term "entity" that lacks such semantic bagage. Dually, "mathematical notions" are deemed too abstract to include mathematical objects, providing another reason to have "entities" as the main category that is split into two subcategories: objects and notions. Disregarding such concerns, the following terms are treated as synonymous with each other (with/out "mathematical" qualifier): entity, object, notion.

A *mathematical primitive* is an undefined mathematical entity. It is an object that lacks a proper definition, at best introduced with a loose description, or merely by appealing to readers' intuition. Whether introduced as a primitive notion or with an axiom, a primitive is still an undefined object that is to be taken for granted.

Many objects in mathematics are primitives: number, set, set membership, point, line, space, etc. Lest fall into *infinite regress*, a theory is usully kicked off by introducing its most essential, most central object, as a primitive (or with an axiom).
