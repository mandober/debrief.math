# Elements of mathematics

*Elements (entities) of mathematics* are the things discussed (mentioned, used, written) in mathematics. They are like grammatical categories in linguistics, so there are, primarily, nouns and verbs. Nouns are like agents, having a role of subjects and objects, and verbs denote operations, actions and states induced on them. Verbs are used to manipulate nouns.

This translates to mathematics in that nouns are *abstract mathematical objects* acted on by *mathematical operations*.
