# Equivalence relation

An *equivalence relation* R on a set S is a set of pairs `R ⊆ S × S` such that
- refl:  xRx
- symm:  xRy ⇒ yRx
- trans: xRy ∧ yRz ⇒ xRz

An equivalence class: [x] := { y | xRy }

The set of equivalence classes forms as a *partition* of `S`. They are disjoint subset of `S` whose union exactly covers `S`.

*Quotient set*, `S / R`, is one of these partitions.

`S / R` means we quotient a set `S` by an equivalence relation `R`.
