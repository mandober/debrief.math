# About axioms

A mathematical theory is an "if â€¦ then" proposition: *if* you accept a certain set of axioms pertaining to a specific theory, *then* you are guaranteed that the statements and conclusions of that theory hold. In modern math, the concept of an axiom has finally lost the appeal to it being an absolute truth, i.e. the truth so evident that everyone accepts it without questions.

This view of axioms stems fro mthe ancient times; it was the position held by Euclid in his Elements, and it was the position that endured through the next millenias. However, this position was never tenable. The question of absolute or even evident truths has no place in math and is best left for phylosophy.

The modern position is much healthier: here's the set of axiom the following theory is based upon - you can accept them if you like or not; if you do accept them, then the things laid out in the theory are guaranteed to hold.

Instead of stopping to deal with the fact that the cental concept of their theory is not defined, going in circle with a bunch of informal descriptions, desperately trying to *appeal to the reader's intuition* (still a habit very difficult to kick), the author can just lay out the axioms and procced with the exposure. Theres's no use in fighting the downward spiral of infinite regression, just like there's no use in convincing the readers of someting.

This way many thoeries can proceed with their development without worrying about their foundations. If some theory's foundation, based on a set of axioms, later somehow turns contradictory to all others advances in mathematics, no problem - such theory will be scrapped. But if it holds, it offers a ready body of knowledge for integration with the rest.
