A **monotonic** or **monotone** function is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order.

- `a ⊑ b -> f(a) ⊑ f(b)` preserves the ordering
- `a ⊑ b -> f(a) ⊒ f(b)` reverses the ordering

Monotonicity: having the property of 
never increasing or 
never decreasing 
as the values of the independent variable 
(or the subscripts of the terms) increase.
