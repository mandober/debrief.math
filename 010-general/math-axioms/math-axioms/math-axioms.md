Index of
  - axioms
  - laws
  - principles
  - identities
  - properties
  - relations

The question of classification of these notions is a tricky one. For example, *extensionality* is a **property** (that entities like functions or sets of some theory may have), and *the axiom of extensionality* is one of the **axioms** of ZF set theory; *reflexivity* is a property of *reflexive relations*. Some term are only pertinent to a specific theory, hardly ever mentioned outside of it.
