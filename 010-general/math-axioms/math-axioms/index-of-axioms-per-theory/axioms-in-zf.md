# ZF Axioms

- `ZF` - the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice
- `ZFC` - the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice,
  ZFC = ZF + AC

Together with The Axiom of Choice, these are the de facto standard axioms for contemporary mathematics or set theory.

ZF axioms:
1. The axiom of extensionality
2. The axiom of empty set
3. The axiom of pairing
4. The axiom of union
5. The axiom of infinity
6. The axiom schema of replacement
7. The axiom of power set
8. The axiom of regularity
9. The axiom schema of specification
10. The axiom of choice (AC)

The axiom of extensionality, empty set, pairing, union, infinity, power set, regularity, axiom schema of replacement and axiom schema of specification.
