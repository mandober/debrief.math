*differential calculus*: (calculus) The calculus that deals with instantaneous rates of change. Synonym: calc (colloquial)

*integral calculus*: (calculus) The calculus that generalizes summation to find areas, masses, volumes, sums, and totals of quantities described by continuously varying functions.

*calculus of variations*: (calculus) The form of calculus that deals with the maxima and minima of definite integrals of functions of many variables. Synonyms: variational calculus.

*infinitesimal calculus*: (calculus) Differential calculus and integral calculus considered together as a single subject.

*operational calculus*: (calculus) The study of calculus from the perspective of the theory of operators.

*vector calculus*: (calculus) The branch of mathematics that covers the differentiation and integration of vector fields, primarily in three-dimensional Euclidean space.

*fractional calculus*: (mathematical analysis, uncountable) The branch of mathematics that studies generalisations of calculus to allow noninteger (i.e. real or complex) powers of the differentiation operator `D` and the integration operator `J`; (countable) any one of said generalisations of calculus.

*absolute differential calculus*: (mathematical analysis, dated or historical) Ricci calculus; the rules of index notation and manipulation for tensors and tensor fields, as developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro.



*Kirby calculus*: (mathematics) A method in geometric topology for modifying framed links in the 3-sphere using a finite set of moves (the Kirby moves).

*Ricci calculus*: (mathematics) A formal system in which index notation is used to define tensors and tensor fields and the rules for their manipulation; the theory of tensor calculus as developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, which formed the foundation of the modern theory.

*Schubert calculus*: (mathematics) A branch of algebraic geometry concerned with solving certain types of counting problem in projective geometry; a symbolic calculus used to represent and solve such problems; (by generalisation) the enumerative geometry of linear subspaces; the study of analogous questions in generalised cohomology theories.

*stochastic calculus*: (mathematics) A branch of mathematics that operates on stochastic processes.

*precalculus*: (education, mathematics) A course, or set of courses, that includes (specifically) trigonometry and algebra at an appropriate level to prepare students to study calculus.


*umbral calculus*: (mathematics, historical) An area of study around the surprising similarity between seemingly unrelated polynomial equations and certain shadowy techniques used to "prove" them.


*modular calculus*: (cryptography) Applied number theory.

*lambda calculus*: (logic, computing theory) Any of a family of functionally complete algebraic systems in which lambda expressions are evaluated according to a fixed set of rules to produce values, which may themselves be lambda expressions.

*logical calculus*: (logic) A formal system.

*predicate calculus*: (logic) The branch of logic that deals with quantified statements. Synonyms: FOL, quantified logic.

*propositional calculus*: (logic) Propositional logic. Synonyms: sentential calculus.

*sequent calculus*: (logic) A set of inference rules for deriving true sequents from other true sequents.

*implicational propositional calculus*: (logic) A minimalist version of propositional calculus which uses only the logical connectives "implies" and "false".

*noncalculus*: Not of or pertaining to calculus.
