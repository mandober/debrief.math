# Math :: PHRASES

Standard, "official", but also temporary and custom mathematical phrases.

 some of the words of mathematics

## Ambient
Ambient is synonymous with adjectives like enclosing, containing, contextual. For example, a formula, in general, is an element of the syntax of the ambient formal language. It is used often when discussing a component or part of some contextual but specific system.

## Relationship
I (frooth? flear?) loath (!) the "-ship" suffix used with "relation". It makes the word longer for no good reason. Plus, I can't shake the impression that "relationships" are for people and "relations" for mathematics (I could be falsely influenced by "friendship", but still). Other people evidently have a different impression. (note that English is not my mother tongue).

## Indeed
The number one filler and completely useless word is probably "indeed". "indeed" is rarely crucial or necessary that removing it would change the meaning at all (99% of time). Counting the number of occurrences of "indeed" must be some kind of signal as to the quality of a textbook (quality control police, arrest this math, it talks in man).

## Natural numbers
Seems that everyone likes hating on the natural numbers. It is rare to encounter the phrase "let x be a natural number", unless, perhaps, the topic is directly about ℕ. Even when the author maintains the form and uses the smallest set of numbers that satisfy certain criteria (as is sensible), and the set ℕ fits the role perfectly - ixnay on the hombre - it will be skipped over nonetheless, with the author reaching for phrases like "non-negative integers" rather then letting one (aka the dreaded "natural numbers") off, out, away and about.

In all other contexts the phrase "let x be a non-negative integer" is favored (even with the "non" prefix which immediately adds 20 punds). 

Come to think of it, another reason could be that the former is often ambiguous, while one never known whether the latter includes zero or not.

Instead it is "let n be an integer/positive integer/non-negative integer".
