# Mathematician

>Quapropter bono christiano, sive mathematici, sive quilibet impie divinantium, maxime dicentes vera, cavendi sunt, ne consortio daemoniorum animam deceptam, pacto quodam societatis irretiant.
>>Thus the good christian should beware of mathematicians and all those who make false prophecies, however much they may in fact speak the truth; lest, being in league with the devil, they may deceive errant souls into making common cause.
-- Augustinus (De genesis ad literam, Liber 2, Caput XVII, Nr. 37)


>A mathematician is a person who can find analogies between theorems; a better mathematician is one who can see analogies between proofs and the best mathematician can notice analogies between theories. One can imagine that the ultimate mathematician is one who can see analogies between analogies.
-- Stefan Banach http://scihi.org/stefan-banach-modern-function-analysis/

>A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn't there.
-- Charles R. Darwin



## On mathematical inconsistency

>Mathematics knows no races or geographic boundaries; for mathematics, the cultural world is one country.
-- David Hilbert (Quoted in H. Eves Mathematical Circles Squared, Boston 1971).

[as long as they are well-standing white men]

>"Meine Herren, der Senat ist doch keine Badeanstalt."
>>("The faculty is not a pool changing room").
