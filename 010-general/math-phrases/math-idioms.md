# Idioms

These are not idioms per se, but "idioms" in the sense that these phrases usually occur in these exact forms (although their meaning is not idiomatic but usually quite literal).

- *the set of the natural numbers* ★★★★★
  The set ℕ is not only a unique set but a well-known one. In one view, this is grounds for the definite article `the`, but in another view, this grands it the definite article `∅`, reserved for ultra-known entities (regardless of the usual rules of whether they've been mentioned before or not, and similar {ma,ju}mbo).

- *the* empty set ★★★
  There's only one empty set - it is a unique object, so usually this warrants the arcticle `the`. However, some phrases may turn `the` into an `a`, for example, when the existence of the set is questioned: "whether there is an empty set", or when there are more sets that could turn out to be empty.
