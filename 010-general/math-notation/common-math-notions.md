# Common mathematical notions

This section, *Common mathematical notions*, is a summary of notions that are fundamental and common to almost all areas of mathematics.


+ Common math notions
  + Mathematical â€¦
    - mathematical notion, mathematical concept
    - mathematical object
    - mathematical primitive
    - mathematical axiom
    - mathematical definition
    - mathematical proof
    - mathematical rigor
    - mathematical method
    - mathematical methodology
    - theorem, lemma, theory
  + mathematical logic
    - mathematical statement
    - presupposition, assumption, premise, hypothesis
    - conclusion
    - truth, truth value
    - argumentation
  + Axioms
    - axiom scheme/schema/schemata
    - an axiom vs axiom scheme
    - division of axioms
      - logical axioms
      - non-logical axioms
    - axiomatic system/theory
      - deductive system
    - axiomatic method
    - axiomatization
    - presuppositions
    - Aristotelian division of presuppositions:
      - general presuppositions
      - theory-specific presuppositions
        - definitions
        - major assertions (postulates)
    - Euclid's division of presuppositions:
      - definitions (explanations and descriptions of terms)
      - postulates (evident presuppositions that are necessary for the construction of geometrical figures, and which correspond to the specific major assertions of Aristotle)
      - axioms (in the Aristotelian sense)
    - stages of a priori sciences (XIX, XX, deductive system)
      - pre-axiomatic
        - characteristic of this form of definition is that within it, all general and evident theses are permitted, namely those that are considered to be certainties.
      - axiomatic
        - the second level of deduction is the axiomatic system in which the basic premises are explicitly mentioned.
      - formulated
        - a deductive system reaches the third stage by formalization. The presuppositions (postulates) become not only the major premises, but also the axiomatic definitions (they constitute the meaning of terms specific to the formalized theory). The empirical meanings that terms may possess outside of the system are not considered. In order to avoid arbitrary usage, they must meet the following conditions:
          - non-contradiction
          - categoricality
          - independence
          - completeness
          - resolvability
        It turned out that no richer formalized theory could meet the last two criteria.
    - Properties of axiomatic systems
      - non-contradiction
      - categoricality
      - independence
      - completeness
      - resolvability
