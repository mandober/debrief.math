A **mathematical notion** can virtually be anything that has to do with mathematics, but especially those concepts equiescient throughout it.

Mathematical notions are those notions common to all areas of mathematics.

Mathematical notions
- objects (mathematical primitive or object in general, …)
- notions (abstraction, generalization, …)
- phrases (mathematical phraseology: "nearly all", "up to an isomorphism")
- methadology (rigor, derivation, proof, …)
- proposition, sentence, statement
- mathematical theory, theorem, lemma
- mathematical model
- mathematical language
- mathematical notation
- primitives, axioms, derivations, tautologies, contradiction, proof

# Mathematics :: General mathematical concepts

What should be called general mathematical concept?

A **symbolic language** is a language that uses symbols (characters) to represent concepts, such as *operations*, *expressions* and *statements*, and the *entities* or *operands* on which the operations are performed.
