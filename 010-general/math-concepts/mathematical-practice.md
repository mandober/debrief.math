# Mathematical practice

Mathematics is primarily practiced in written form, on paper, blackboard, computer. Philosophical parts of math, like FOM and POM, may be discussed verbally, general math, especially topics that contain formulas are almost always practiced in written form. It is also common, especially in mathematical education, to practice math in both verbal and writen form. This setting also requires speaking the formulas out alound, and fortunatelly, math formulas usually come with a pronunciation guidelines.

Although mathematics is practiced "on paper" (paper, blackboard, computer, etc.), mathematical objects exclusively live in the human mind. Human mind is still the only interpretor capable of evaluating general mathematical content (mathematical prose) correctly, although software is getting smarter all the time.

A peculiarity of the mathematical language is that it is a mix of prose (in a natural language) interspersed with formulas. A mathematical content is almost never completely expressed using formulas alone, even if this is possible. In general, a mixed approach seems to be preferred with paragraphs in e.g. English that describe even things that could be expressed as formulas. Especially informal mathematical texts that aim for approachability and readability, prefer using prose as much as possible. However, sometimes only math formulas can express things unambiguously and always succinctly.

Geometry, as one of the first fields of mathematics, was perhaps inpired by objects found in objective reality, but these objects were immediately abstracted and generelized, becoming idealized versions of real objects they were modeling (Platon's forms).
