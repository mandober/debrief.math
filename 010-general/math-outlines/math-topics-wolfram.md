## Rectangle function

The rectangle function `Π(x)` is a function that is 0 outside the interval [-1/2,1/2] and *unity* inside it. It is also called the gate function, pulse function, or window function, and is defined by

```
Π(x) = 0     for |x| > 1/2
     = 1/2   for |x| = 1/2
     = 1     for |x| < 1/2
```

## Generalized Function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_function
https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedFunction.html

A **generalized function**, also called a *distribution* or *ideal function* is a class of all regular sequences of particularly well-behaved functions equivalent to a given regular sequence. As its name implies, a generalized function is a generalization of the concept of a function.

For example, in physics, a baseball being hit by a bat encounters a force from the bat, as a *function of time*. Since the transfer of momentum from the bat is modeled as taking place at an instant, the force is not actually a function. Instead, it is a multiple of the *delta function*.

The set of distributions contains functions (locally integrable) and *Radon measures*. Note that the term "distribution" is closely related to statistical distributions.
