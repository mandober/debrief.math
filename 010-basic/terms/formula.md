# Formula

A formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and *formation rules* of a given *logical language*. 

For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion; but, having done this once in terms of some parameter, mathematicians have produced a formula (V = 4/3 π r³) that can be used to calculate the volume. Syntactically, a *well-formed formula* is a syntactically valid expression (mathematical object) constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language (given a set of symbols of a logical language, all constructible expressions are formulas, but only the syntactically valid are expressions are WFFs; they may still be semantically weird, however). In mathematics, a formula generally refers to an *identity*, which is a logical proposition (possibly in the form of a formula) that should hold; however, the goal is the same to that of equality binary relation, i.e. to establish the equality between two mathematical expressions. Some of the most important propositions (identity) are awarded the status of mathematical *theorems*.

## Formula

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula

A **formula** is a concise way of expressing information symbolically, as in a mathematical formula.

The informal use of the term "formula" in science refers to the *general construct of a relationship between given quantities*.

## In mathematics

In mathematics, a **formula** generally refers to an *equation* relating one *mathematical expression* to another, with the most important ones being *mathematical theorems*. 

For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion. However, having done this once in terms of some parameter (e.g. radius), mathematicians have produced a formula to describe the volume of a sphere in terms of its radius, `V = 4/3∙πr³`. Having obtained this result, the volume of any sphere can be computed as long as its radius is known.

Mathematical formulas are often algebraic, analytical or in closed form.

In a general context, formulas are often a manifestation of mathematical model to real world phenomena, and as such can be used to provide solution (or approximated solution) to real world problems, with some being more general than others.

For example, the formula `F=ma` is an expression of Newton's second law, and is applicable to a wide range of physical situations. Other formulas, such as the use of the equation of a sine curve to model the movement of the tides in a bay, may be created to solve a particular problem. In all cases, however, formulas form the basis for calculations.

**Expressions** are distinct from formulas in that they cannot contain an equals sign (!). Expressions can be likened to phrases the same way formulas can be likened to grammatical sentences.

## In mathematical logic

In mathematical logic, a formula, often referred to as a **well-formed formula**, is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language.

For example, in first-order logic, `∀x∀y(P(f(x)) → ¬(P(x) → Q(f(y), x, z)))` is a formula (provided that `f` is a unary function symbol, `P` a unary predicate symbol, and `Q` a ternary predicate symbol).

## In computing

In computing, a formula typically describes a calculation, such as addition, to be performed on one or more variables. A formula is often implicitly provided in the form of a computer instruction such as.

For example, `Celsius = 5/9 * (Fahrenheit - 32)`.

In computer spreadsheet software, a formula indicating how to compute the value of a cell, say A3, could be written as `=A1+A2` where A1 and A2 refer to other cells (column A, row 1 or 2) within the spreadsheet. This is a shortcut for the "paper" form `A3 = A1+A2`, where A3 is, by convention, omitted because the result is always stored in the cell itself, making the stating of the name redundant.

## Units

Formulas used in science almost always require a choice of units.

Formulas are used to express relationships between various quantities, such as temperature, mass, or charge in physics; supply, profit, or demand in economics; or a wide range of other quantities in other disciplines.

An example of a formula used in science is Boltzmann's entropy formula. In statistical thermodynamics, it is a probability equation relating the entropy S of an ideal gas to the quantity W, which is the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate:

S = k⋅logW           (1) S = k ln W

where `k` is Boltzmann's constant equal to `1.38062 x 10−23 joule/kelvin`, and `W` is the number of microstates consistent with the given macrostate.
