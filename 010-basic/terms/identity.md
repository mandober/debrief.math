# Identity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(mathematics)

In mathematics, an identity is an equality relating one mathematical expression A to another mathematical expression B, such that A and B (which might contain some variables) produce the same value for all values of the variables within a certain range of validity.

In other words, A = B is an identity if A and B define the same functions; identity is the equality between functions that are differently defined.

For example, `(x + 1)² = x² + 2x + 1` is an identity.

## Logic and universal algebra

Formally, an identity is a true universally quantified formula of the form 
`∀x₁ … xₙ (s = t)`, where `s` and `t` are terms with no other free variables than `xᵢ`. The quantifier prefix (∀x₁ … xₙ) is often left implicit, when it is stated that the formula is an identity.

For example, with the implicit quantifier (∀a ∀b ∀c), the axioms of a monoid are often given as the formulas
`a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c`    
`a * 1 = a = 1 * a`

These formulas are identities in every monoid.

As for any equality, the formulas without quantifier are often called equations.

In other words, *an identity is an equation that is true for all values of the variables*.
