# Well-definedness

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined

A **well-defined expression** is an expression whose definition assigns it a unique interpretation or value.

The opposite of unambiguous expression is an *ill-defined* or ambiguous expression.

A **well-defined function** is one that gives the same result when the representation (not the value) of the input changes; e.g. `f : ℝ → ℝ` is well-defined if `f(0.5) = f(1/2)`. Well-definedness of a function with a domain that is a quotion set obtained from an equivalence relation, crucially depends on its ability to handle the change of representatives of the equivalence class.
