# Math :: Elementary Concepts

## About this section

- elementary notions of mathematics
- primitive notions
- language of mathematics
- syntax, notation, symbols, formulas, expressions
- mathematical logic
- set theory
- proof theory


This section of the `math` debrief is titled "010-basics". It describes and tries to enumerate the *elementary mathematical notions*, aka *the basics* or *the fundamentals* or *the primitive concepts*, which are those mathematical notions that occur throughout mathematics and are common to almost all mathematical fields, influencing other sciences as well.

Like mathematical development itself, the elementary notions include a large part of logic, which is in this case called *mathematical logic* (an extreme related to this is the *logicism*, which is an approach that reduces all math to logic; it famously failed). Logic, especially first-order predicate logic, establishes the primary language of mathematics that is used to write formulas, although *mathematical formulas* are also often expressed using a mix of a natural language and formal logic; logic symbols provides a lot of shorthands (∀, ∃, ⇒, ⇔, etc.) making the math synax shorter and more succinct.

Being a collection of theories, the elementary concepts of math also include large parts of proof theory: primitive object, axiom, definition, theorem, lemma, theory, conjecture, proof, etc.

Modern math is still considered by many to be founded on set theory (specifically, on ZFC), so set theory exerts influenced on the *language of mathematics*, particularly syntax-wise with the proliferation of symbols like ∈, ⊆, ⊂, ∪, ∩, etc.
