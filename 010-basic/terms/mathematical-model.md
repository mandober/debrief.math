# Mathematical model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model

A **mathematical model** is an abstract description of a concrete system using mathematical concepts and language.

The process of developing a mathematical model is termed *mathematical modeling* and it is taught as a subject in its own right.

A mathematical model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behavior.

Mathematical models are used in
- applied mathematics
- natural sciences (physics, biology, earth science, chemistry)
- engineering (computer science, electrical engineering)
- non-physical systems (social sciences)
- social sciences (economics, psychology, sociology, political science)
- music
- linguistics
- philosophy (analytic philosophy)
- business
- military operations
