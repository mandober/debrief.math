# Mathematics :: Elementary concepts

## What should be considered an elementary mathematical concept?

The introduction of various **mathematical concepts** hasn't always followed a sensible order, chronologically speaking. Derived notions have appeared long before the notions they are logically derived from.

Probably the oldest mathematical concept is that of *quantity*, concretized as the *concept of number*, then becoming the object of study in many branches of mathematics like arithmetics, and more generally algebra, and eventually number theory. Numbers are probably the most elementary, the most primitive and the most fundamental concept in mathematics as it would be very hard to imagine it without them. On the other hand, numbers, as primitive and necessary as they seem to be are defined in terms of sets, which suggests that the concept of set is actually the most primitive and fundamental one.





The next is probably *the concept of space* and the imperfect artefacts of reality that were readily abstracted into their perfect geometric forms. 

(served to model the perfect abstractions that live only in the mind) 


The progress of *number theory* seems to have always been interlaced with that of *geometry*, as their development have unfolded together for a very long time.

Imperfect objects encountered in the world have been conceptualized into perfect abstractions in the mind in the field of *geometry*.

Observing infinity of patterns and recognizing that seemingly even sufficiently different ones nevertheless fall into the same category, is a vulgar display of abstraction power so intrinsic to humans, no other species on the planet would dream boast about (except dolphins and koalas).

*Arithemtic and geometry*, initiated by the ancient Greeks, are the oldest areas of mathematics.

Introduction of new mathematical fields hasn't stopped since, but a discipline particularly worth mentioning was the development of *calculus* in the XVI century.

At the turn of the XIX to XX century, mathematical knowledge has become too enormous for a single person to get a hold of, marking the lifes of the last polymaths.
