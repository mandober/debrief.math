# Math :: Elementary Mathematical Concepts

- debrief: math
  - section: math fundamentals
    - subsection: elementary mathematical concepts

Elementary Mathematical Concepts (EMC or E = mc²) subsection collects the definitions of the most fundamental mathematical knowledge: the most primitive mathematical objects and concepts, presenting the elementary mathematical notation and mathematiquette, sporadically unwinding with unprovoked rants.

This is one of those *enumerate • define • describe • rant* sections, without a clear goal, serving more as an index and a kind of reference for extremely basic mathematical subjects - those universal notions found across all fields of mathematics.
