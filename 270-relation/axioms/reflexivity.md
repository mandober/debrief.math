## Reflexivity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation

In mathematics, a binary relation R over a set X is reflexive if it relates every element of X to itself. Formally, this may be written ∀x ∈ X : x R x, or as I ⊆ R where I is the identity relation on X.

An example of a reflexive relation is the relation "is equal to" on the set of real numbers, since every real number is equal to itself. A reflexive relation is said to have the reflexive property or is said to possess reflexivity. Along with symmetry and transitivity, reflexivity is one of three properties defining equivalence relations.








Properties
- reflexive
- non-reflexive
- irreflexive (anti-reflexive)
- non-irreflexive
- coreflexive
- non-coreflexive
- quasi-refexive


Examples

1. Relation "is equal to", i.e. `=`, on the set of real numbers is reflexive since every real number is equal to itself. Replacing $$R$$ with `=` we see that $$xRx$$ becomes $$x=x$$, which holds for any $$x$$.

2. Let $$X=\{1,2,3,4\}$$. For relation $$R$$ to be reflefive, it must contain all the identity pairs, $$R=\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)\}$$ of the set $$X^2$$. It can additionally contain any extra pairs, but missing a single id pair will make this relation __non-reflexive__. If the relation contains **only** id pairs then this is **identity** relation.


## Quasi-reflexivity


## Irreflexivity

> A binary relation is **irreflexive**, or **anti-reflexive**, if no element is related to itself.

Irreflexive relation prohibits membership for identity pairs. In an endorelation, $$X^2$$, on a set $$X=\{1,2,3\}$$, the relation is irreflexive if it doesn't contain any of the identity pairs i.e. $$(1,1)$$, $$(2,2)$$ or $$(3,3)$$. If it contains even a single id pair, it is __non-irreflexive__. If it contains all the id pairs it is reflexive.

An example is the "_greater than_" relation on the set of real numbers, since no real number is greater than itself.

Not every relation which is not reflexive is irreflexive; it is possible to define relations where some elements are related to themselves but others are not.

For example, the binary relation "_the product of x and y is even_" is reflexive on the set of even natural numbers, irreflexive on the set of odd natural numbers, and neither reflexive nor irreflexive on the set of natural numbers.

Examples of irreflexive relations include:
- $$\not =$$, "_is not equal to_"
- $$\lt$$, "_is less than_"
- $$\gt$$, "_is greater than_"
- $$\subset$$, "_is a proper subset of_"


## Coreflexivivity

A binary relation is coreflexive

An example of a coreflexive relation is the relation on integers in which each odd number is related to itself and there are no other relations.

The equality relation is the only example of a both reflexive and coreflexive relation.

Any coreflexive relation is a subset of the identity relation.
