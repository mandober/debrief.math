## Relation axioms

* Reflexivity
  - Reflexivity: reflexive relation if `a` is related to itself, `aRa`
  - Irreflexivity
  - Coreflexivity

* Symmetry
  - Symmetry
  - Antisymmetry
  - Asymmetry
  
* Transitivity
  - Transitivity


- Reflexivity
  - reflefive, `Re`: Id+
  - non-reflefive, `!Re`
  - irreflefive, `iR`
  - non-irreflefive, `!iR`
  - coreflexive, `cR `
  - non-coreflexive, `!cR `
- Symmerty
  - symmertic, `Sy `
  - non-symmertic, `!Sy `
  - anti-symmertic, `vS `
  - non-antisymmertic, `!vS `
  - asymmertic, `aS `
  - non-asymmertic, `!aS `
- Transitivity
  - transitive, `Tr `
  - non-transitive, `!Tr `


- reflexive: `Sy+Tr+Serial`
- equivalence, `EQ` = `Re+Sy+Tr`
- partial equivalence, `pEQ`: `Sy+Tr`
- partial order: `pOrd` = `Re+vS+Tr`
- linear (total) order: partial order that is total, `Re+vS+Tr+`
- linear (total) order: partial order that is total, `Re+vS+Tr+Total`
- well-order: linear order where every non-empty subset has a least element.

- The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment.
