# Relation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation

The term *relation* most often refers to a binary relation, although ternary or, generally, n-ary relations are also encountered.


A *finitary relation* or *n-ary relation* is a set of n-tuples.

Specific types of relations include:
- Binary relation (or correspondence, dyadic relation, or 2-place relation)
- Equivalence relation (reflexive + symmetic + transitive relation)
- Heterogeneous relation, a relation between possibly distinct sets
- Reflexive relation
- Serial relation
- Ternary relation (or triadic, 3-adic, 3-ary, 3-dimensional, or 3-place relation)

Relation may also refer to:
- Directed relation
- Relation algebra, an algebraic structure inspired by algebraic logic
