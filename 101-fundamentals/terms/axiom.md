# Axiom

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom

An axiom is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.

The word comes from the Greek `ἀξίωμα` (axíōma) "that which is thought worthy or fit" or "that which commends itself as evident".

In classic philosophy, an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established, that it is accepted without controversy or question.

In modern logic, an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.

In mathematics, the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses: logical axioms and non-logical axioms.

*Logical axioms* are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define and are often shown in symbolic form, e.g. A∧B->A.

*Non-logical axioms* are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory, (e.g. a+b=b+a in arithmetic). When used in this sense, "axiom", "postulate", and "assumption" may be used interchangeably. In most cases, a non-logical axiom is simply a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory, and may or may not be self-evident in nature (e.g. parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry).

To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There may be multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain.

Any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Whether it is meaningful (and, if so, what it means) for an axiom to be "true" is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics.

Since a theory must start somewhere to avoid the infinite regression, it is free to make a "cut" and choose the starting point in the form of a term that is central to a particular theory, which is introduced without definition. Such starting term is supposed to be taken for granted by appealing to people's intuition as something that is obviously true. For example, the central notion in set theory is set, introduced without definition, sometimes as a mathematical primitive, other times as an axiom (e.g. "there exists the empty set").

It is usually insisted that axioms are obvious truths that are sufficiently evident to anybody with a human's intuition and perception, but this doesn't seems rigourous enough to withstand every critic. And perhaps it should be; why not just let axioms be whatever the author chooses? This is what they come to anyway.

Therefore, in a certain theory, the author comes up with a set of axioms and it is free to choose however ridicilous assumptions as they want. The whole point is this: if you accept this set of axioms as true, then these derived truths follow. I mean, for a number of theories, it already comes down to this. Axioms should be free of obligations and justification. Then, one mathematical matter would have many theories, eash one based on a different set of axiom. The problem is then to rank the competing theorems. An evident way would surely be based on a number of axioms; ceteris paribus, a theory with less axioms would surely subsume the one with more axioms. And if two competing theories have more-less the same number of axioms, perhaps the elegance would play a part, or lobbing, bribe or influencers.
