In mathematics, a conjecture is a *conclusion* or a *proposition* which is suspected to be true due to preliminary supporting evidence, but for which no proof or disproof has yet been found.

Some conjectures, such as the Riemann hypothesis or Fermat's Last Theorem (now a theorem, but it was a conjecture until 1995 when it was finally proven true by Andrew Wiles), have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.

Conjectures
- Riemann hypothesis
  - conjectured in 1859 Bernhard Riemann
- Twin primes conjecture
  - conjectured in 1849 by de Polignac (more general conjecture)
- Goldbach's conjecture
  - conjectured in 1742 by Christian Goldbach 
+ Fermat's Last Theorem
  - conjectured in 1637 by Pierre de Fermat
  - proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles
+ Four color theorem
  - conjectured in 1852 by Francis Guthrie
  - proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken
+ Poincaré conjecture
  - conjectured in 1904 by Henri Poincaré
  - proven in 2006 by Grigori Perelman


*Fermat's Last Theorem* (ex "Fermat's conjecture") states that no 3 positive integers a,b,c can satisfy the equation aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ for any integer value of
n greater than two, `∀abcn ∈ ℕᐩ. n > 2 -> ¬(aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ)`

*The four color theorem* was ultimately proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer.
