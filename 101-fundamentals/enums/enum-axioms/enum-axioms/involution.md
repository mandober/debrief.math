# Involution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)


*Involutory function* is a function that is its own inverse.

An *involution*, or an *involutory function*, is a function $$f$$ that is its own inverse, $$f(f(x)) = x$$

for all $$x$$ in the domain of $$f$$

Equivalently, applying $$f$$ twice produces the original value.

The term **anti-involution** refers to involutions based on *antihomomorphisms* (see Quaternion algebra, groups, semigroups)

$$f(xy) = f(y) f(x)$$ such that

$$xy = f(f(xy)) = f( f(y) f(x) ) = f(f(x)) f(f(y)) = xy$$

# Involution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)

An **involution**, or an involutory function, is a function `f` that is its own inverse, `f(f(x)) = f(x)` (for all `x` in the domain of f). Equivalently, applying f twice produces the original value.

> Any involution is a bijection.

Example of an involuntary function: `f(x) = -1 * x`


In set theory, involution or *double complement law* states:    
(Aᶜ)ᶜ = A


The term **anti-involution* refers to involutions based on *antihomomorphisms* (see Quaternion algebra, groups, semigroups)    
`f(xy) = f(x)f(y)`    
such that    
`xy = f(f(xy)) = f( f(x) f(y) ) = f(f(x)) f(f(y)) = xy`


Examples of involution:
- identity map is a trivial example of an involution
- multiplication by −1 in arithmetic
- taking of reciprocals
- complementation in set theory
- complex conjugation
- circle inversion
- rotation by a half-turn
- reciprocal ciphers such as the ROT13 transformation
