# Distributivity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributive_property

Algebraic structures consisting of 2 binary operations (e.g. ring) are subject to distributivity of one operation over the other.

Distributivity ⨂ of over ⨁:
- left distributivity: a ⨂ (b ⨁ c) = (a ⨂ b) ⨁ (a ⨂ c)
- right distributivity: (b ⨁ c) ⨂ a = (b ⨂ a) ⨁ (c ⨂ a)
- (total) distributivity: left and right distributivity


Given a set $$S$$ and 2 binary operators $$\star$$ and $$\odot$$ on $$S$$, and $$\forall x,y,z \in S$$


- the operation $$\star$$ is **left-distributive** over $$\odot$$ if:    
  $$x*(y+z) = (x*y) + (x*z)$$

- the operation $$\star$$ is **right-distributive** over $$\odot$$ if:     
  $$(y+z)*x=(y*x)+(z*x)$$

- the operation $$\star$$ is **distributive** over $$\odot$$ if:     
  it is both left and right distributive

- if $$\star$$ is commutative, these 3 axioms are equivalent:    
  *left-distributive ≡ distributive ≡ right-distributive*



Algebraic structures consisting of 2 binary operations (e.g. ring) are subject to distributivity of one operation over the other.

Given a set `S` and 2 binary operators `*` and `+` on `S`:
- the operation `*` is **left-distributive** over `+` if    
  $$(\forall x,y,z \in S)\ .\ x*(y+z) = (x*y) + (x*z)$$
- the operation `*` is **right-distributive** over `+` if     
  $$(\forall x,y,z \in S)\ .\ (y+z)*x=(y*x)+(z*x)$$
- the operation `*` is **distributive** over `+` if it both left and right-distributive.
- when `*` is commutative, these 3 conditions are logically equivalent

a(b + c) = ab + ac

- The Distributive Law does not work for division
