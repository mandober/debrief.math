## Types of magma

Magmas are not often studied as such; instead there are several different kinds of magma, depending on what axioms the operation is required to satisfy. Commonly studied types of magma include:

Quasigroup
A magma where division is always possible

Loop
A quasigroup with an identity element

Semigroup
A magma where the operation is associative

Inverse semigroup
A semigroup with inverse.

Semilattice
A semigroup where the operation is commutative and idempotent

Monoid
A semigroup with an identity element

Group
A monoid with inverse elements, or equivalently, an associative loop, or a non-empty associative quasigroup

Abelian group
A group where the operation is commutative
Note that each of divisibility and invertibility imply the cancellation property.

- Right-cancellative
- Cancellative
- A semigroup with left zeros
- A semigroup with right zeros



A magma `(S, •)`, with `x,y,u,z ∈ S` is called:

- **Medial**            if `xy • uz ≡ xu • yz`
- **Left semimedial**   if `xx • yz ≡ xy • xz`
- **Right semimedial**  if `yz • xx ≡ yx • zx`
- **Semimedial** if it is left and right semimedial
- **Trimedial**  if any triple of (not necessarily distinct) elements generates a medial submagma
- **Entropic**   if it is a homomorphic image of a medial cancellation magma

- **Left distributive**  if `x • yz ≡ xy • xz`
- **Right distributive** if `yz • x ≡ yx • zx`
- **Autodistributive** if it is left and right distributive
- **Commutative** if `xy ≡ yx`
- **Idempotent**  if `xx ≡ x`
- **Unipotent**   if `xx ≡ yy`
- **Zeropotent**  if `xx • y` ≡ `xx` ≡ `y • xx`
- **Alternative** if `xx • y` ≡ `x • xy` and `x • yy` ≡ `xy • y`
- **Power-associative** if a submagma generated by any element is associative
- **Flexible** if `xy • x` ≡ `x • yx`
- **associative** (or a semigroup) if `x • yz` ≡ `xy • z`
- **left unar**  if `xy` ≡ `xz`
- **right unar** if `yx` ≡ `zx`
- **null semigroup** *semigroup with zero multiplication* if `xy ≡ uv`
- **Unital** if it has an identity element
- **Left-cancellative**  if `∀xyz. xy = xz => y = z`
- **Right-cancellative** if `∀xyz. yx = zx => y = z`
- **Cancellative**       if right-cancellative and left-cancellative
- *semigroup with left zeros*  if it is a semigroup and `∀x. x ≡ xy`
- *semigroup with right zeros* if it is a semigroup and `∀x. x ≡ yx`
