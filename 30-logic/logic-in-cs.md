*Logic in CS*, or *computational logic*, is a field on the intersection between mathematical logic and computer science.

It contains:
- investigations into logic that are guided by applications in CS:
  - Rewriting systems
  - Combinatory logic
  - Abstract interpretation
- Fundamental concepts in CS that are naturally expressible in logical form:
  - Type theory (used in type systems)
  - Formal semantics of programming languages
  - Hoare logic
  - Logic programming
- Applications of fundamental concepts derived from the theory of computation:
  (that cast light on questions of pure logic)
  - Curry-Howard correspondence
  - Game semantics
- Tools for logicians considered as applied CS:
  - Automated theorem proving and Model checking.
