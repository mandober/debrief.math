# Logic

Logic is concerned with the most general laws of truth, including
- classification of arguments
- systematic exposition of the logical form
- study of inference, fallacies, paradoxes, etc.

> **Logic** is the systematic study of the valid forms of inference.

> **Valid inference** is the one where there's a specific relation of logical support between the inference's assumptions and conclusion.

> Logic **evaluates arguments**    
> in order to *develop methods*     
> that allow us *to distinguish*     
> the *good* from the bad *arguments*,     
> *and* to **classify**    
> *correct ways* of **reasoning**    
> and drawing of *conclusions*.
