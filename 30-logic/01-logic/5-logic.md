# Logic

Since ancient times, logic has been studied in philosophy. Since the mid XIX century, mathematics has developed interest in logic as well, with mathematical logic emerging as the new branch. In more recent times, logic has become an important area of interest to computer science, linguistics and other cognitive sciences.

There is no clear definition of logic or the scope of its subject matter. It has traditionally studied argumentation, with focus on arguments, their form and parts (premise, rules of inference, conclusion). Logic has also included the study of syntax, semantics, proofs, paradoxes, fallacies.

Logic is the study of arguments.

Logic is the systematic study of the valid forms of inference.

Logic has always concern itself with the systematic exposition of the forms of valid arguments.

An inference has the valid form when there is a certain relation of logical support between the inference's assumptions and conclusion.

In a natural language, logical inference is often indicated by words like "therefore", "thus", "hence", "ergo", etc.

Logic evaluates arguments in order to develop methods that allow us to distinguish the good from the bad arguments and to classify correct ways of reasoning and drawing of conclusions.

Logic attempts to codify what counts as legit means by which to draw conclusions from given assumptions.
