## Consequence

Consequence is a (if not *the*) core subject matter of logic. Aristotle's study of the syllogism instigated the task of categorising arguments into the logically good and the logically bad; the task remains an essential element of the study of logic. In a logically good argument, the conclusion follows validly from the premises; thus, the study of consequence and the study of validity are the same.
