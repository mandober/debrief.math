# Associativity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property

In math, the **associative property** is a property of some binary operations. In propositional logic, associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs.


$$\forall x,y,z\ .\ x \star (y \star z) = (x \star y) \star z$$


$$\forall x,y,z\ .\ x \star (y \star z) = (x \star y) \star z$$


The Associative Law does not work for subtraction or division

(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
(ab)c = a(bc)
