*Anarboricity*: number assigned to finite graphs, defined as the size of the largest partition of the graph into edge-disjoint subgraphs, each containing at least one cycle. It is named in honor of the city of Ann Arbor by Frank Harary.

*Arctic circle theorem*: describes the boundary of domino tilings

*Atlantic City algorithm*: probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that answers correctly at least 75% of the time.

- *Babylonian square root method*: iterative numerical method for improving an approximation to the square root of a positive number.

- *Basel problem*: problem in mathematical analysis related to number theory

- *Byzantine generals problem*: condition of a distributed computing systems where components may fail and potential adversity always lurks.

- *Cairo pentagonal tiling*
- *Canadian traveller problem*
- *Chinese postman problem*

- *Chinese remainder theorem*: theorem in number theory concerning solutions of systems of linear Diophantine equations, in the present day usually stated in the language of modular arithmetic. It is so called because it was discovered in China in the 3rd century AD.

- *Chinese restaurant process*: stochastic process with applications in population genetics. It is so called because of an analogy to the custom of table-sharing in Chinese restaurants.

- *Complex Mexican hat wavelet*
- *Delian problem*

- *Egyptian fraction*: way of representing a positive rational number as a sum of distinct (i.e. no two the same) reciprocals of positive integers. These were a part of a numeral system used in ancient Egypt.

- *Egyptian multiplication*
- *Erlangen program*: the program for future research in mathematics proposed by Felix Klein in 1872 while he was at the University of Erlangen in Germany.
- *French railroad metric*

- *Hawaiian earring*: topological space homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the union of a countably infinite family of open intervals. It is so called because of the appearance of a picture of the space, showing an infinite sequence of circles mutually tangent at a common point.

- *Hungarian algorithm*
- *Indian numerals*
- *Irish logarithm*
- *Japanese ring*

- *Japanese theorem for cyclic polygons*: geometric theorem found in a Shinto shrine during Japan's Edo period

- *Las Vegas algorithm*

- *Ljubljana graph*: undirected bipartite graph with 112 vertices and 168 edges.

- *Manhattan distance*: distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.
- *Mexican hat wavelet*

- *Monte Carlo method*: any of many methods of simulation involving pseudo-randomness. The name alludes to the randomness of gambling casinos for which Monte Carlo is famous.
- *Nauru graph*
- *Nottingham group*
- *Oberwolfach problem*
- *Paris metric*
- *Paxos algorithm*
- *Polish notation*
- *Polish space* (in topology)
- *Roman surface*: self-intersecting mapping of the real projective plane into 3D with an unusually high degree of symmetry. It is so called because Jakob Steiner was in Rome when he thought of it.
- *Russian peasant multiplication*
- *St. Petersburg paradox*
- *Scottish Book*

- *Seven bridges of Königsberg*: famous problem in what would become graph theory, originally phrased as the problem of finding a way to walk across all of Königsberg's seven bridges and return to one's starting point without walking across any bridge more than once.

- *Swiss cheese*
- *Syracuse problem*
- *Toronto space*
- *Tower of Hanoi*

- *Tropical geometry*: algebraic geometry with addition in place of multiplication and the min operator in place of addition. It is so called because it was developed by Brazilian mathematicians.
- *Warsaw circle*

- *Woods Hole formula*: fixed-point theorem discussed at a meeting in 1964 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts
