Numeral prefixes are derived from numerals or occasionally other numbers.

In English and other European languages, they are used to coin numerous series of words, such as unicycle – bicycle – tricycle, dyad – triad – decade, biped – quadruped, September – October – November – December, decimal – hexadecimal, sexagenarian – octogenarian, centipede – millipede, etc.

There are two principal systems, taken from Latin and Greek, each with several subsystems; in addition, Sanskrit occupies a marginal position.

There is also an international set of metric prefixes, which are used in the metric system, and which for the most part are either distorted from the forms below or not based on actual number words.

In some forms, a final vowel is dropped before a root that begins with a vowel, with the exceptions of bi-, which is bis- before a vowel, and of the other monosyllables, du-, di-, dvi-, tri-, which are invariable.

* Cardinal series
- derived from cardinal numbers
- English:
  - one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eigth, nine, ten
  - Short scale: septillion (1000^8)
  - Long scale: quadrillion (10^24)
- Greek  : mono, bi, ter, quater, quint, hepta, sesta
- Latin  : un(us), due, tres, quattor, quinque, sex, septa, octa, nove, deci



* Multiple series
  - based on adverbial numbers
  - English: once, twice, thrice (or three times), then `n times`

* Distributive series:
  - original meaning is now frequently lost
  - English: one each, two each,... `n each`
  - one by one, two by two, ..., `n by n`

* Ordinal series
  - based on ordinal numbers
  - EN: first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth
  - EN: written numerically, numbers are suffixed with `-th` unless ending in:
    - `-1` suffix: `-st` (1st, 21st, 101st, etc)
    - `-2` suffix: `-nd` (2nd, 32nd, 502nd, etc)
    - `-3` suffix: `-rd` (3rd, 93rd, 1203rd, etc) 

* Fractions:
  - If n>2, the ordinal forms are used for fractions
  - only the fraction `1/2` has special forms

For the hundreds, there are competing forms:
- `-gent-` derived from the original Latin
- `-cent-` derived from `centi-` (and similar) plus prefixes for 1..9


Deca- (and dec-) sometimes deka- is a common English-language numeral prefix derived from the Late Latin decas ("(set of) ten"), from Ancient Greek δέκας (dékas), from δέκα (déka, "ten").[

Decennial, ten-yearly or a celebration of ten years.

The decimal numeral system also called base-ten positional numeral system, and occasionally called *denary* or *decanary*.


- `demi` (metric prefix) (or demi-), a former metric unit prefix not adopted by SI
- `demi-` (numerical prefix), a linguistic prefix representing half, see Numeral prefix
