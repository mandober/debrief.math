Operations are functions of various fixity (some are suffix, most infix, rarely prefix) denoted by their own associated symbol.

Fixity:
- precedence
- affix

Precedence:
- strong
- week
- neutral

Associativity:
- left 
- right: tower of exponents $$n^{2^{2^{2}}} = n^{(2^{(2^{2})})}$$

Arity:
- unary (negation)
- binary
- ternary

Notation:
- by affix: prefix?, infix, suffix
- by placement: $$2\frac{1}{3}, x^n, mn$$
- misc

Affix:
- infix: $$a+b, a/b, g\circ f$$
- suffix: n!, n!!, n$
- prefix: negation: $$-x$$, in logic: $$\lnot p$$


Unary operators are prefix (negation) or suffix (factorial).
