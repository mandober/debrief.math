# Matrix multiplication

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication

* The product of matrices `A` and `B` is denoted as `AB`.
* The number of columns of `A` must be equal to the number of rows of `B`.
* The matrix product has the number of rows like `A` and columns like `B`.
* Matrix multiplication was first described by the French mathematician Jacques Philippe Marie Binet in 1812 to represent the composition of linear maps.
* Matrix multiplication is a basic tool of linear algebra.


Two matrices, `A`, sized `m⨯p`, and `B`, sized `p⨯n`, are multiplied to produce the matrix `C`, sized `m⨯n`.
