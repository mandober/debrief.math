* Turing, Church, G√∂del, Computability, Complexity and Randomization: A Personal View - video lectures by Michael O. Rabin, Harvard University, 2012

The [above named] have innovated the concept of computability in the 1930's. Alan Turing gave his definition of computability via a creation of a model of a universal stored program computer. The distinction between computable and non-computable functions was subsequently refined by a discussion of the inherent complexity of computable functions. The speaker will draw from his *personal interaction with Church, G√∂del and the people working with John von-Neumann* a picture of the evolution of computing as well as give a perspective of the future of computer science and technology. üéìüé¨‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
