# Theory of computation: GLOSSARY


## Alphabet
In formal language theory, a string is defined as a finite sequence of members of an underlying base set which is called the alphabet (of a string).

## String
In formal language theory, a string is defined as a finite sequence of members of an underlying base set; this set is called the alphabet of a string.

## P
In complexity theory, `P` or `PTIME` or `DTIME(nᵒ⁽¹⁾)` (denoting `DTIME` of `n` raised to the power of `O(1)`) is a fundamental complexity class that contains all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time (i.e. in polynomial amount of time).
