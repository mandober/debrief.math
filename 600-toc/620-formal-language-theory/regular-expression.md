# ToC ∷ Formal Language Theory ∷ Regular expression

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression

A **regular expression** is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern for string-searching algorithms.

Regular expressions are related to Regular Languages, which are the subject of study of Formal Language Theory, a branch of Theory of Computation.

The study of regular languages and regular expressions was initiated in 1950s with Kleene's formalization of a regular language.

Different syntaxes and conventions for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s, eventually canonicalized into several standards. The two of the more prominent are the *POSIX standard* and the *Perl standard* which is stil the most popular one - Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE)

Regular expressions came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. They are used mainly related to text searching, in search engines, "find and replace" dialogs of text editors, in utilities such as `sed` and `awk`, in lexical analysis. The last point is discouraged because although regexp are ubiquitous, readily available and fairly easy to use, they have a strictly defined set of languages on which they can be used, namely, regular languages; beware of zalgo: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/#1732454
