## Chomsky hierarchy

Automata theory: formal languages and formal grammars

Chomsky hierarchy describes the relations between various languages and kinds of formalized logic.

Each category of languages, except those marked by an asterisk, is a proper subset of the category directly above it. 

Any language in each category is generated by a grammar and by an automaton in the category in the same line.
