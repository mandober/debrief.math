Stack machine (0-operand machine)
Accumulator machine (1-operand machine)
Register machine (2,3,... operand machine)
Random-access machine
Cell-probe model
Robertson-Webb query model

Chomsky hierarchy
Turing completeness

Abstract machine and models equivalent to it (e.g. lambda calculus is equivalent to the Turing machine) - used in proofs of computability and upper bounds on computational complexity of algorithms.
Decision tree models - used in proofs of lower bounds on computational complexity of algorithmic problems.

Many models of computation have been proposed 
(all have a notion of discrete time steps, as does a Turing Machine)
1. *Turing Machine* was proposed by Alan Turing in 1936
2. *λ-calculus* was proposed by Alonzo Church in 1941. The λ-calculus enables
   one to speak of functions from sets of functions to sets of functions
3. *Post systems* were proposed by Emil Post in 1943
   They are a generalization of Grammars
4. *Wang machines* were proposed by Hao Wang in 1957
5. *Markov Algorithms* were proposed by Andrei Andreivich Markov in the 1940's
6. *Register machines* were proposed by Abraham Robinson and Calvin Elgot in 
   the 1960's. They resemble an actual computer more than most models.
7. *Random Access Machines* were proposed by Steven Cook and Robert Rechow 
   in the 1970's. They resemble an actual computer more than most models.
