# Cellular Automata

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton

A cellular automaton (CA) is a *discrete model of computation* studied in *automata theory*.

Cellular automata are also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homogeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling.

In a simpler form, a cellular automaton is a regular, (in)finite 2D grid of cells, with each cell in one of the two states (on/off, dead/alive).

A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states (e.g. on and off). For each cell, a set of cells called its *neighborhood* is defined relative to the specified cell. An *initial state* (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell (usually randomly). A new *generation* is created (advancing t by 1), according to a fixed set of rules (generally, a mathematical function), that determine the new state of each cell in terms of the current configutation of the cell and its neighborhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and doesn't change over time, and it is applied to the whole grid *simultaneously* (though exceptions are known, such as the stochastic cellular automaton and asynchronous cellular automaton).
