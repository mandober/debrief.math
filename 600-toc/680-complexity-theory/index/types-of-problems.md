# Types of problems

* Computational problems
  - Problem instances
  - Representing problem instances
  - Decision problems as formal languages
  - Function problems
  - Measuring the size of an instance

* Machine models and complexity measures
  - Turing machine
  - Other machine models
  - Complexity measures
  - Best, worst and average case complexity
  - Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems

* Complexity classes
  - Defining complexity classes
  - Important complexity classes
  - Hierarchy theorems
  - Reduction

* Important open problems
  - P versus NP problem
  - Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete
  - Separations between other complexity classes

* Intractability
* Continuous complexity theory
* History
