# Parity


In mathematics, parity is the property of an integer's inclusion in one of two categories: even or odd. An integer is even if it is divisible by two and odd if it is not even. For example, 6 is even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2. By contrast, 3, 5, 7, 21 leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Examples of even numbers include âˆ’4, 0, 82 and 178.

**Parity** is the quality of an integer of being even or odd.

An integer is **even** if it is divisible by 2.
An integer is **odd** if it is not even, i.e. it is not divisible by 2.


The relation "_divisible by_", between nonzero integers `m` and `n`, denoted by `m | n` means that `m` evenly divides `n` (without remainder).

__*DEFINITION:*__ **Divisibility**     
If `m` and `n` are nonzero integers it is said that `m` divides `n` 
(or `m` is a divisor of `n`, or `n` is a multiple of `m`), 
denoted by `m | n`, 
if there is an integer `k`, such that `n = mk`.
