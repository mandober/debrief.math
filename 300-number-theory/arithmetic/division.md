# Division

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics)

- division is one of the 4 basic operations of arithmetic
- division of dividend n by a divisor d is denoted by n/d, or n ÷ d
- division is undefined if the divisor d is 0
- multiplication and division are each other's inverse operations
- multiplication subsumes division, n ÷ d = n * 1/d = n * d⁻¹
- division escapes the closure but multiplication maintains within it
- kinds of division:
  - precise: Euclidean division (closed) and proper division (open)
  - imprecise: integer division (Euclidean sans remainder)


Division of two integers, n ÷ d, may be considered as the process of calculating the number of times d is contained within n. Since the result is not always an integer (divison escapes the closure), it has spawned two different concepts of division: *proper division* whose codomain is ℝ, and *integer division* that drops the fractional part from the result in order to force codomain to ℤ (to preserve the closure over ℤ).

∀n,d ∈ ℤ -> n/d ∈ ℝ     7 / 4  = 1.75    
∀n,d ∈ ℤ -> n//d ∈ ℤ    7 // 4 = 1   


The *division with remainder*, or *Euclidean division*, of two natural numbers produces a *quotient* and a *remainder* such that `n = dq + r`. When the remainder is 0, the dividend n is divisible by the divisor d, `d|n`.

Proper division produces a result that is ℚ or ℝ, so all involved numbers must be in this domain as well. Also, divisor d must not be 0, in which case division is undefined, thus making division a partial function. In these enlarged number sets, division is the inverse operation to multiplication.

Both forms of division appear in various algebraic structures:

Those algebraic structures in which a Euclidean division is defined are called *Euclidean domains*, and include polynomial rings in one indeterminate (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas).

Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called *fields* and *division rings*. In a ring, the elements by which division is always possible are called the units (for example, 1 and -1 in the ring of integers).

Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the *quotient group*, in which the result of "division" is a group rather than a number.
