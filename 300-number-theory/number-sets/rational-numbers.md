# Rational numbers

* A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction `p/q` of two integers, a numerator `p` and a non-zero denominator `q`.

* Since `q` may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number.

* The set of all rational numbers is denoted by â„š (quotient).

* The decimal expansion of a rational number either:
  - terminates after a finite number of digits
  - infinitely repeats a particular finite sequence of digits

* Rationals may be build from the natural numbers by including a multiplicative inverse, `1/n`, for each nonzero integer `n`, along with the products formed by multiplying these inverses with integers.
