# Prime numbers

> A prime number is a natural number dividible by 1 and itself.


> Mersenne numbers have the form 2ᵏ−1 and some are prime.

* They got the name after the French theologian and mathematician Marin Mersenne (1588-1648)

* By the end of the XVI century, the highest Mersenne prime was 524,287 which equals 2¹⁹−1. At the start of the XXI century, 2⁴²¹¹²⁶⁰⁹−1 was the highest, containing approximately 13 million digits!

* The *prime factorisation* of the integers is a central point of study in number theory and can be visualised with Ulam spiral.

* **Fundamental theorem of arithmetic (FTAr)**, also called the **unique factorisation theorem**, states that every integer greater than 1, is either prime or the unique product of primes. This is the reason 1 is not a prime; if 1 were a prime, the product of primes would not be unique; instead of having a unique product (e.g 24=2³×3), there would be arbitrary number of 1 factors (24=2³×3×1 or 24=2³×3×1×1, etc.).

* Prime number distribution: The German mathematician Carl Gauss had proved (at the age of 14) that as x → ∞, the function π(x), which estimates the number of primes up to x, is given by `π(x) ~ x/ln x`.

* A perfect number equals the sum of its factors (e.g. 6=1×2×3). This sequence begins with: 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336. Euclid had proved that if m is prime, and of the form 2ᵏ−1, then m(m+1)/2 is an even perfect number.
