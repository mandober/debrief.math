# Arithmetic function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_function

An **arithmetic function** (or a number-theoretic function) is usually understood as a function whose domain is ℤᐩ and whose range is a subset of the complex numbers, `f : A → B` with `A = ℤᐩ` and `B ⊆ ℂ`.

An example of an arithmetic function is *the divisor function* whose value at a positive integer `n` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`.
