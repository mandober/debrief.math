# Combinatorics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics

Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and an end in obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. It is closely related to many other areas of mathematics and has many applications ranging from logic to statistical physics and from evolutionary biology to computer science.

The full scope of combinatorics is not universally agreed upon because it crosses so many mathematical subdivisions. Insofar as an area can be described by the types of problems it addresses, combinatorics is involved with:
- the enumeration of specified structures (configurations) of finite systems
- the existence of such structures that satisfy certain given criteria
- the construction of these structures
- optimization: finding the most optimal structure or solution

Leon Mirsky has said: "combinatorics is a range of linked studies which have something in common and yet diverge widely in their objectives, their methods, and the degree of coherence they have attained".

One way to define combinatorics is, perhaps, to describe its subdivisions with their problems and techniques. However, there are also purely historical reasons for including or not including some topics under the combinatorics umbrella. Although primarily concerned with finite systems, some combinatorial questions and techniques can be extended to an infinite (specifically, countable) but discrete setting.

Combinatorics is well known for the breadth of the problems it tackles. Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in algebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry, as well as in its many application areas.

Many combinatorial questions have historically been considered in isolation, giving an ad hoc solution to a problem arising in some mathematical context.

In the later XX century, however, powerful and general theoretical methods were developed, making combinatorics into an independent branch of mathematics in its own right.

One of the oldest and most accessible parts of combinatorics is graph theory, which by itself has numerous natural connections to other areas.

Combinatorics is used frequently in computer science to obtain formulas and estimates in the analysis of algorithms.

A mathematician who studies combinatorics is called a combinatorialist.

### Enumerative combinatorics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_combinatorics

*Enumerative combinatorics*, the most classical area of combinatorics, concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects.

Although counting the number of elements in a set is a rather broad mathematical problem, many of the problems that arise in applications have a relatively simple combinatorial description.

Fibonacci numbers is the basic example of a problem in enumerative combinatorics. The *twelvefold way* provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions.
