# Yoneda lemma

A characterization of the morphisms either to or from a fixed object describes its universal property; the cases of "to" or "from" are dual. By the **Yoneda lemma** - which, despite its innocuous statement, is arguably the most important result in category theory - every object is characterized by either of its **universal properties**.

The idea of probing a fixed object using morphisms abutting to it from other objects in the category gives rise to a notion of **generalized elements**. The elements of a set `A` are in bijection with functions `∗ → A`, whose domain is a singleton set `∗`. A generalized element of `A` is a morphism `X → A` with generic domain.

>The Yoneda lemma implies that a general mathematical object can be represented as a functor valued in the category of sets.

A related classical antecedent is a result that comforted those who were troubled by the abstract definition of a group: namely that any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group.

>A deep consequence of these functorial representations is that proofs that general categorically-described constructions are isomorphic *reduce to the construction of a bijection between their set-theoretical analogs*.
