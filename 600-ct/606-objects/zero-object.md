A **zero object** (or null object) is an object that is both initial and terminal.

```js
A   B   C
  ↖ ↑ ↗
    Z
  ↗ ↑ ↖
A   B   C
```

A pointed category is one with a zero object.

## Examples

- 𝗦𝗲𝘁, the category of sets, has no zero objects (the empty set is the unique initial object, and any singleton is a terminal object).
