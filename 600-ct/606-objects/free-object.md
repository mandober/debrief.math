# Free object

The idea of a free object is one of the basic concepts of abstract algebra.

>Informally, a *free object* over a set `A` can be thought of as being a "generic" algebraic structure over `A`: the only equations that hold between elements of the free object are those that follow from the defining axioms of the algebraic structure.

Examples include free monoids, free groups, tensor algebras, free lattices.

This concept is a part of universal algebra, in the sense that it relates to all types of algebraic structure (with finitary operations). It also has a formulation in terms of category theory, although this is in yet more abstract terms.

A *free object* over a set forgets everything about that set except some universal properties, specified by the word following free. For example, the *free monoid over Integers* forgets unique factorization, unique representation in every base, the GCD function, and everything else about the Integers except: they are a set of objects, there is an associative (binary) operation on Integers, and there is a "neutral" Integer; precisely the universal properties of monoids.

## Definition

Free objects are the direct generalization to categories of the notion of *basis in a vector space*.

A linear function `u : E1 â†’ E2` between vector spaces is entirely determined by its values on a basis of the vector space E1. The following definition translates this to any category.
