# F-algebra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-algebra

F-algebras generalize the notion of algebraic structure.

Rewriting the algebraic laws in terms of morphisms eliminates all references to quantified elements from the axioms, so the algebraic laws may then be glued together in terms of a single functor, F, called the signature.

In CS, F-algebras are used to represent data structures such as lists and trees.

The main related concepts are *initial F-algebras*, which encapsulate the induction principle, and their dual construction, *F-coalgebras*, which encapsulate the coinduction principle.
