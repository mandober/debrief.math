# CT :: Key concepts :: Category

The notion of category is one of the three big concepts in category theory, alongside functor and natural transformation (NT). It is said that Eilenberg and MacLane introduced functors and categories just as the foundation for NTs.

A category is a collection of objects and morphisms between those objects. The dubious term "collection" suggests there is no escaping set theory, which has dibs on any kind of gathering together of mathematical objects. If the collection of morphisms between any two objects forms a set (as opposed to a class), it is called **a locally small category** A category 


* Category is a definition of structure. Category is the essence of structure, it is a structure abstracted to bare essentials. Pure structure.


- category is a collection of objects and morphisms
- a category C is a collection of Ob(C) and Ar(C)
- objects are abstract, featureless blobs
- morphisms express relations between objects
- objects are represented by dots due to high-level of abstraction, and only the network of relations, i.e. morphisms, is "visible".
- CT takes a relativistic approch to math objects - each object and its properties are determined only through its relations with other objects.
- Set is the category of sets as objects, and functions as morphisms.
- Set is the proto-typical, examplary category not only because it may be said to model a prototypical category, but it plays a more significant role due to the fact that many categories have a special relations to Set. Hom-sets are obejcts in Set after all.
- discrete category has no arrows except id arrows and it can represent a set (one siongle set); set is a structureless collection and so is such cat.
- nondiscrete categories have structure and to presenve it, a mapping (functor) must map objects as well as arrows.
