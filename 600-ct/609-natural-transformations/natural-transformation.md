# Natural Transformation

Natural transformation (NT) is a mapping between functors.

Natural transformation provides a way of transforming (mapping) one functor into another while preserving the internal structure of the categories involved. Hence, a natural transformation is like a morphism of functors.






Natural transformation is the third big categorical concept, after categories and functors.

Structure-preserving mappings
- Morphisms are structure-preserving mappings between objects.
- Functors are structure-preserving mappings between categories.
- Natural transformations are structure-preserving mappings between functor.

This trinity repeats itself across category theory: first, at the basic level of a single category, we have objects and morphisms that map them in a structure-preserving fashion. Then functors are mappings between categories that also preserve structure. NTs are mapping between functors that also preserve structure. Thus, any kind of mapping preserves structure. When categories get more complex, with functors playing the role of objects and NT playing the role of morphisms, the structure preserving quality of mappings always remain.

* Since there are only two objects in category `𝟚`, a natural transformation between fucntor Δᶜ and F (both 𝟚 -> C) will have just two components. And since there are no morphisms in `𝟚`, we don't have to worry about the naturality condition. It so happens that in this case the naturality condition for our transformation is trivially satisfied, because there are no morphisms (other than the identities) in `𝟚`.
