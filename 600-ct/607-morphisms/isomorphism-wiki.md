# Isomorphism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism

In mathematics, an **isomorphism** is a *structure-preserving mapping* between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping.

~~An *isomorphism is an invertible function*. A function is invertible iff it is a bijection. So, an *isomorphism is a bijective function*. That is, to be an isomorphism, function `f` (1) must be a bijection/invertable, and (2) the inverse of function `f` (i.e. the function `f⁻¹`) must exists; `f⁻¹` is some other function that must exist for `f` to be an isomorphism. However, the question is then: (A) Is `f` then the isomorphism? Or, (B) is the isomorphism a pair of functions that are each other's inverses, so `f` and `f⁻¹` together? The answer must be (B) because from the POV of `f`, `f` is the isomorphism and `f⁻¹` is just a necessary condition, a sidekick at best; but from the POV of `f⁻¹`, the function `f⁻¹` is the isomorphism, while `f` is the sidekick. The two functions are both isomorphisms. Moreover, if one is an isomorphism, the other must be as well. *The two functions are isomorphic!* They are isomorphic up to an isomorphism! Up to what isomorphism? Up yours?~~


The "inverse" function is then *the isomorphism*, and the function that was before *the isomorphism* in now just *the inverse of the isomorphism*. Yet the referent of the phrase "the inverse of the isomorphism" is surely that same isomorphism, i.e. isomorphisms are involuntary functions (i.e. their own inverses). But this is not true, since an isomorphism is a single function that need not be its own inverse - its inverse only need to exists (some other function).



Two mathematical structures are *isomorphic* if an isomorphism exists between them.

The word "isomorphism" is derived from the Ancient Greek: `ἴσος` [isos] "equal", and `μορφή` [morphe] "form", "shape".


The interest in isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects have the same properties (excluding further information such as additional structure or names of objects). Thus isomorphic structures cannot be distinguished from the point of view of structure only, and may be identified. In mathematical jargon, one says that two objects are the same up to an isomorphism.[citation needed]

An automorphism is an isomorphism from a structure to itself. An isomorphism between two structures is a canonical isomorphism (a canonical map that is an isomorphism) if there is only one isomorphism between the two structures (as is the case for solutions of a universal property), or if the isomorphism is much more natural (in some sense) than other isomorphisms. For example, for every prime number p, all fields with p elements are canonically isomorphic, with a unique isomorphism. The isomorphism theorems provide canonical isomorphisms that are not unique.

The term isomorphism is mainly used for algebraic structures. In this case, mappings are called homomorphisms, and a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective.

In various areas of mathematics, isomorphisms have received specialized names, depending on the type of structure under consideration. For example:

An isometry is an isomorphism of metric spaces.
A homeomorphism is an isomorphism of topological spaces.
A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of spaces equipped with a differential structure, typically differentiable manifolds.
A symplectomorphism is an isomorphism of symplectic manifolds.
A permutation is an automorphism of a set.
In geometry, isomorphisms and automorphisms are often called transformations, for example rigid transformations, affine transformations, projective transformations.
Category theory, which can be viewed as a formalization of the concept of mapping between structures, provides a language that may be used to unify the approach to these different aspects of the basic idea.
