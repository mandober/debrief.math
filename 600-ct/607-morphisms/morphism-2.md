# Morphism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphism

In general, a **morphism** is a structure-preserving map from one *mathematical structure* to another one of the same type. The notion of morphism recurs in much of mathematics:
- morphisms are functions in set theory
- morphisms are linear transformations in linear algebra
- morphisms are group homomorphisms in group theory
- morphisms are continuous functions in topology (and analysis)

1. (mathematics, category theory) (formally) An arrow in a category;
2. (less formally) an abstraction that generalises a map from one mathematical object to another and is structure-preserving in a way that depends on the branch of mathematics from which it arises.

Morphisms, along with objects, are the two basic elements of a category.

In category theory, *morphism* is a broadly similar notion: the mathematical objects involved need not be sets, and the relationships between them may be something other than maps (functions), although the morphisms between the objects of a given category have to behave similarly to maps, in that they have to admit an associative operation similar to function composition.

>A morphism in category theory is an abstraction of *homomorphism*.

The study of morphisms and structures (called objects) over which they are defined is central to category theory.

Much of the terminology of morphisms, as well as the intuition underlying them, comes from *concrete categories*, where *objects* are sets, possibly endowed with an additional structure, and *morphisms* are structure-preserving functions.

>A **concrete category** is one with sets as objects.

In category theory, morphisms are also called *arrows*.
