In a more narrow sense, a homomorphism is a function between the underlying sets of two algebras that preserves the algebraic structure.

In a more broad sense, a homomorphism is a function between structured sets that preserves any existing structure.

In a general sense, "homomorphism" is synonymous with "morphism" (in category theorey).

In a traditional sense, the term "homomorphism" has also been used for what is called (weak) 2-functor between bicategories.
