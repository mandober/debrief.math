# Morphism

http://nlab-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/morphism

In a general category, a morphism is an arrow between two objects.

The notion of morphism in category theory is an abstraction of the notion of homomorphism.

## Definition

For all objects, `x` and `y`, in a (locally small) category, there is a set called hom-set, `hom(x,y)`, whose elements are morphisms from `x` to `y`.

Given a morphism `f` in the hom-set, we write `f : x â†’ y` to denote a morphism with the source object `x` and the destination object `y`, i.e. an arrow from `x` to `y`.
