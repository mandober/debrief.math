# Maps

"x-jectivity" maps
- epimorphism  ~ full functor           ~ surjection
- monomorphism ~ faithful functor       ~ injection (embedding)
- isomorphism  ~ fully faithful functor ~ bijection (isomorphism)

Combos
- isomorphism = epimorphism + monomorphism
- automorphism = endomorphism + isomorphism
- fully faithful functor = full + faithful
- bijection = injection + surjection

Structure-preserving maps
- injection, injective function, embedding
- bijection, bijective function, isomorphism
- homomorphism
- morphism (homomorphism)
- functor
- NT

Self maps
- endofunction
- endomorphism
- endofunctor

Identity maps
- identity morphism
- identity functor
- identity NT
