# Hom-set

*Hom-set* is short for homomorphism set, inheriting this term from the group theory. In the category `Grp` morphisms are actually homomorphisms.

However, in a broader sense, a *hom-set* of a category `C` is a collection of morphisms of `C`, denoted `Hom(C)`, Ar(C) or Mor(C), or, given any two objects `a` and `b` in the category C by `C(a, b)`.

>Now, is the hom-set the entirety of arrows in a given category, or just the collection of arrows from one specific object to another, or even a collection of arrows going out from one specific object? It seems the definition depends on the use of the qualifier "any", as in "given any two objects in category‚Ä¶". For now, it seems it is a collection of all morphisms in a category, although in that case there would be no need to mention objects at all.

In a category `ùìí`, a **hom-set** is the set of all morphisms from `a` to `b`, where `a,b ‚àà Ob(ùìí)`.

Given two objects `a` and `b` in a category `ùìí`, the collection of all arrows of the form `a -> b` forms a set, called **hom-set**.

A **hom-set** may be denoted as `ùìí(a,b)` for (any?) objects `a` and `b` in a category `ùìí`. It may also be denoted as `Hom·∂ú(a,b)`; or, letting `ùìí` be implicit, simply as `Hom(a,b)`.

In the `Set` category, objects are sets and arrows are (total) functions on sets. But functions are also sets (of ordered pairs), set-theoretically at least, so functions are also objects in `Set`; even though they may be distiguished by being called *exponential objects*, so that an arrow `f:a‚Üíb` is also an exponential object denoted by `b·µÉ`. It seems functions are objects in any case, whether normal objects in Set (since they are sets), or exponential objects (in a Carthesian closed category), (or both?).
