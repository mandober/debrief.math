# Introduction to Category Theory


## Informal Description

* Category theory is a framework for describing general abstract math structures.
* Category theory is a general mathematical *theory of structures* and of *systems of structures*.
* Category theory is really about building bridges between different math areas.
* Category theory is a general theory of functions.
* Category Theory is a study of mathematical objects and morphisms between them.
* Category theory is abstract nonsense.


## History

Category theory has been around since 1940's when it was co-founded by Samuel Eilenberg (1913-1998) and Saunders Mac Lane (1909-2005). Eilenberg was a Polish-American mathematician working in the field of algebraic topology, while the American mathematician, MacLane, worked in abstract algebra.

Eilenberg and Mac Lane recognized that virtually the same calculations were been carried out in different areas of mathematics, which led them to develop category theory as a bridge that connects various math fields.

Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane introduced the concepts of *categories*, *functors*, and *natural transformations* in 1942-45 in their study of algebraic topology, with the goal of understanding the processes that preserve mathematical structure.

Saunders Mac Lane and Samuel Eilenberg wrote a joint paper that introduced the notion of a "category" in 1942. (the working title for the paper was *"general abstract nonsense"*).


## Definition


---

Category theory occupies central position in contemporary math and theoretical CS.


As category theory is still evolving, its functions are correspondingly developing, expanding and multiplying.

At minimum, it is a powerful language, or conceptual framework, allowing us to see the universal components of a family of structures of a given kind, and how structures of different kinds are interrelated.

Category theory is both an interesting object of philosophical study, and a potentially powerful formal tool for philosophical investigations of concepts such as space, system, and even truth.

It can be applied to the study of logical systems in which case category theory is called "categorical doctrines" at the syntactic, proof-theoretic, and semantic levels.

Category theory even leads to a different theoretical conception of set and, as such, to a possible alternative to the standard set theoretical foundation for mathematics.

As such, it raises many issues about mathematical ontology and epistemology. 

Category theory thus affords philosophers and logicians much to use and reflect upon.

Category theory is the source of new programming ideas, particularly well exploited by Haskell as the most prominent among the languages to recognize the importance and practicality of concepts therein.

Concepts that originated in category theory include functors, applicatives, monads, as well as many prefixed constructs like comonads, bifunctors, etc.

These concepts have endowed the language with new capabilities, such as the ability to abstract over a certain behavior or computation.

The category theory shifts the focuses from idiosyncratic properties and implementation details (including their elements) of structures, to the relations between them. This should be familiar and interesting to programmers, particularly because it's the kind of structure that's composable. And having composable elements are what the programming is all about.

The importance of composability doesn't only concern programmers, but people in general. It's a property we find essential in face of complexity, because, Teslas aside, we cannot intuitively grasp a very complex entity/concept in a comprehensive all-encompassing manner. Fortunatelly, equipped with the latest evolutionary upgrade, the mind with abstract thought support, we came up with a cunning strategy, for which we're infamous across the chordata phylum, codename "divide and conquer".

It's analysis followed by synthesis that gives us means to tackle some very complex problems. The analysis part is partitioning a huge problem into a bunch of smaller ones, until they are sufficiently small we can reason about them easily. Once we form a solid body of knowledge, we can start composing the smaller parts into bigger and bigger structures, working our way toward unifying solutions to the smaller problems, into the overall solution. Eventually, composing a single theory of everything.

In category theory, the concept of an element, or a point, generalizes the more usual set theoretic concept of an element of a set to an object of any category. This idea often allows restating of definitions or properties of morphisms (such as monomorphism or product) given by a universal property in more familiar terms, by stating their relation to elements. Some very general theorems, such as Yoneda's lemma and the Mitchell embedding theorem, are of great utility for this, by allowing one to work in a context where these translations are valid. This approach to category theory, in particular the use of the Yoneda lemma in this way, is due to Grothendieck, and is often called the method of the functor of points.
