# Universal properties (morphisms)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property

In this video we define universal properties, universal morphisms, initial/terminal properties and initial/terminal morphisms. We illustrate how the product can be viewed as a universal morphism. We define an exponential object, and discuss how it corresponds to a universal morphism. We also define a natural number object, and describe how it corresponds to the set of natural numbers in the category of sets. I also define comma categories, and describe how universal morphisms correspond to initial/terminal objects within them. I also show that the natural number object corresponds to a universal morphism using a new proof.

The proof is given in the (unlisted) video: https://youtu.be/h0kVqeZCdJc

## Universal morphism

A look at what's often called the most important concept in category theory, that of universal properties or universal morphisms.

Universal morphism allows us find the best object by collecting all applicable objects and then ranking them. Usually, an object `A` is ranked higher than an object `B` if there is a unique arrow `B -> A`.

B

## Universal property

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property#Initial_morphism

A **universal property** is a property that characterizes up to an isomorphism the result of some categorical constructions.

Thus, universal properties can be used for defining some objects independently from the method chosen for constructing them.

The concept of universal property allows a simple proof that all constructions of ℝ are equivalent: it suffices to prove they all satisfy the same universal property.
