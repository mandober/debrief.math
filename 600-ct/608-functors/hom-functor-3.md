# Hom-functor

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hom_functor

The *hom-sets* (i.e. sets of morphisms between objects) give rise to important functors to the category of sets, that is, to functors from some category `𝓒` to category `Set`.

These functors are called hom-functors and have numerous applications in category theory and other branches of mathematics.
