# CT :: General :: Uses of Category Theory

## In mathematics

Many new mathematical constructions have emerged as unifications of previous cross-field constructions. Namely, each mathematical field has its own constructions, unique to that field, that nevertheless appear surprisingly similar when seen from an even higher level of abstraction - from the level of category theory.

One striking example is that of a product, a construction that many mathematical fields support, but each with a different flavor. In set theory, it is a Cartesian product of sets; in the theory of matrices, it is the matrix product; group theory also has a product as do lot of other theories. What the category theory has done, was bringing all these different product constructions under a single definition of a product that has unified all other instances.

Besides the product, category theory has unified many other constructions, conveniently expressing each in terms of categories. Examples include limits, quotient spaces, coproducts, completion, duality.

## In computer science

In the field of programming language theory (PLT), category theory has seen proliferation of use, particularly in the functional programming (FP) paradigm.

Haskell, a purely functional programming language is today one of the biggest supporter of using category theory to model many language constructions. Haskell is known for employing monads to solve the problem of input/output in face of a pure language. The use of monads, especially in the designof the `IO` type allow Haskell to handle impure, effectful functions through the runtime.
