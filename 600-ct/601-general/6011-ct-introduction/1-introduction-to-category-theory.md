# CT :: Introduction :: Introduction to category theory

## Developement

Category theory was developed in the 1940's by *Samuel Eilenberg* and *Saunders MacLane* in their foundational work on algebraic topology. Eilenberg was an algebraic topologist and MacLane was an algebraist. They both realized that they were doing much of the same calculations in different areas of mathematics, which led them to lay the foundations of category theory.

## What is category theory

* The essence of a category is composition, or, if you prefer, the essence of composition is a category.

* Category theory is a *general theory of mathematical structures and their relations*.

* Category theory is a convenient and powerful *conceptual framework* and a *formal language* for studying and discussing structures and systems of structures across mathematics.

* In programming language theory, category theory can be viewed as a *formalization of operations on data types*.

* In functional programming, category theory is a *foundational theory of functions*, providing the general framework for purely functional programming.


Category theory is used in almost all areas of mathematics. In particular, many constructions of new mathematical objects from previous ones that appear similarly in several contexts are conveniently expressed and unified in terms of categories. Examples include quotient spaces, direct products, completion, and duality.

The *language of category theory* has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level mathematical abstractions such as sets, rings, groups.

Category theory allows us to
- formulate definitions and theories of concepts
- to analyze the coherence of existing formulations
- to discover and exploit their relations with other mathematical fields
- to deal with abstraction and representation independence
- to formulate conjectures and research directions
- to unify mathematical concepts

## Formal systems and category theory

There are two modern formulations for packaging mathematical theories: there is the concept of formal system, due to David Hilbert, and there is the concept of category, the great innovation of Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane. These two formulations have vastly different intents.

A *formal system* representing a mathematical theory has, within it, all of the mechanics and vocabulary necessary to discuss proofs, and the generation of proofs, in the mathematical theory; indeed, that is mainly what a formal system is all about.

In contrast, a *category* has a sparse vocabulary: it can say nothing about proofs; a category is a mathematical entity that, in the most succinct of languages, captures the essence of what a mathematical theory consists of - objects of the theory, permissible transformations between these objects, and a composition law telling us how to compose these transformations.
