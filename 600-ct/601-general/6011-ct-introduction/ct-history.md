# History of category theory

Category theory was introduced by **Samuel Eilenberg** and **Saunders Mac Lane** in the 1940's in their foundational work on algebraic topology.

Samuel Eilenberg (1913 - 1998) was a Polish-American mathematician, a co-founder of category theory and homological algebra, and a researcher in algebraic topology.

Saunders Mac Lane (1909 - 2005) was an American mathematician, a co-founder of category theory, a researcher of algebra.

Despite the fact that Eilenberg was an algebraic topologist and MacLane was an algebraist, they both realized that they were doing fundamentally the same calculations although in different areas of mathematics, which led them to lay the foundations of category theory.
