# The basic entities of CT

The basic entities of category theory are
- category                - consisting of
- objects                 - anchors for morphisms
- morphisms               - mappings of objects
- functors                - mappings of categories
- natural transformations - mappings of functors

All categorical mappings preserve structure.

However, these entities are not fixed in their roles - they can quickly jump between these roles. For example, functors are mappings between categories, but functors are also objects in category of functors, where NTs play the role of morphisms. In higher category theory, even categories themselves become objects, with functors playing the role of morphisms.
