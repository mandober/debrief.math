# 2. Influence of category theory

## CT and Foundations of Mathematics

Some say that category theory may be used as an axiomatic foundation for mathematics, thereby replacing, or at least, providing an alternative to set theory.

In its effect on the view of mathematical objects, category theory plays a fine balancing role: it extracts the best elements from both a Fregean (very general) and a "bureau-of-standards" (very specific, example-based) attitude towards the formulation of mathematical concepts.


## CT and CS

In CS, category theory contributes to areas that include automata theory, domain theory, functional programming, polymorphism, semantics, type theory.

Category theory had, and still has, a great influence on the purely functional programming languages, expecially Haskell, which derives many of its essential concepts from it. In fact, Haskell hierarchy of type classes mimics the categorical constructions: Functor, Applicative, Monad, Adjunctions, Free monads. Category theory has informed Haskell with the solution, in the form of monads, to the problem of dealing with side-effects in a pure setting.

In programming language theory, category theory can be viewed as a *formalization of operations on data types* and a *foundational theory of functions*, providing the general framework for functional programming.
