# CT :: ROADMAP

Into to CT. What is CT about, what it tries to accomplish: universal language of math, connecting diverse math areas though their commonalities. The promise of CT - inferring properties through relations.

Prerequisits to CT. Abstract algebra. Algebraic structures. Set theory. The problem with the set of all sets. Set vs class vs congomerate. Set return to bite as we introduce the category of categories.

The notion of category. Elements of a category. Objects. Arrows as relations between objects and main point of interest. Features of objects inferred indirectly via arrows. Objects not important, only relations (arrows) important. Objects and arrows as main but also relative constituents of a category. Relative as the level of abstraction increases: arrows become objcets, fucntors become arrows; then functors become objects, NTs become arrows, etc.

Def and laws of category. Examples of cats. Simple cats. Concrete cats. Small, locally small (ST bites again!). Basic notions and terminology re a category. Initial and terminal object. Isomorphism, hom-set, functor, NT.
