# Category Theory :: Additional components


Philosophy of category theory
- Set theory as a low-level, "assembly", language of math
  - concerns about repr, e.g. ordered pair was already a concept before people tried to back-port it into set theory, yielding many definitions of which Kuratowski's seems the most popular.
- Category theory as a high-level math language



Additional components of category theory:
