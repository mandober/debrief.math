If set theory is still the accepted FOM, then everything's a set (possibly augmented with additional structure, e.g. operations and constraints), but from the categorical perspetive, owning to it being so ridiculously high, we see sets as the insignificant tiny particles, which are categorically called *objects*.

These, below proud, structurefull sets, that bogart all the glory for themselves, are given a kick in the arse here, condemned to a miserable life of structureless anchors, so that our preciousss arrows have somewhere to hang off of.

Unlike in the gutters below, arrows, preciousss arrows, are the shit here among the clouds because.
