# Skeletal category

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(category_theory)

A **skeleton of a category** is a subcategory that, roughly speaking, does not contain any extraneous isomorphisms. In a certain sense, the skeleton of a category is the "smallest" *equivalent category*, which captures all "categorical properties" of the original.

In fact, two *categories are equivalent* if and only if they have *isomorphic skeletons*.

A category is a *skeletal category* if isomorphic objects are necessarily identical.
