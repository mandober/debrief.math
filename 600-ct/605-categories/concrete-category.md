# Concrete category

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_category

A **concrete category** is a category equipped with a *faithful functor* to the `Set` category.

This functor makes it possible to think of the objects of the category as *sets with additional structure*, and of its morphisms as *structure-preserving functions*.

Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete categories; for example, *the category of topological spaces* and *the category of groups*, and, trivially, also `Set` category itself. On the other hand, *the homotopy category of topological spaces* is **non-concretizable** i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to the category of sets.

A concrete category, when defined without referencing the notion of a category, consists of a class of objects, each equipped with an underlying set: for any two objects `A` and `B`, there is a set of functions, called morphisms, from the underlying set of `A` to the underlying set of `B`. Furthermore, for every object `A`, the identity function on the underlying set of `A` must be a morphism from `A` to `A`, and the composition of a morphism from `A` to `B` followed by a morphism from `B` to `C` must be a morphism from `A` to `C`.

A **relatively concrete category** is a category that is equipped with a faithful functor to some other category but `Set`.

# Concrete category

A concrete category is a category equipped with a faithful functor to the category of sets, `Set`. The faithful functor makes it possible to think of the objects of the category as sets with additional structure, and morphisms as structure-preserving functions.
