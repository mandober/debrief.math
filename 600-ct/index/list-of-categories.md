## Index of names

Any deductive system `T` with objects formulae and morphisms proofs.


Types of categories
- discrete categories
- named categories
- generic categories


List of categories
- List of named categories
- List of discrete categories
- List of generic categories
- List of distinguished categories



The objects of Exp are arrows A √ó B ‚Üí C in C. An arrow k ‚Üí h of Exp is an arrow f : C√óB ‚Üê D√óB of C just when the following diagram commutes:


Generic categories
- 1-category, a cat of 1 object and 1 (id) arrow
- 2-category, a cat of 2 objects and 2 (id) arrows
- opposite cat, a cat opposite of cat C is C·µí·µñ with arrows inverted

Category constructions
- opposite category: opposite category of `ùìí` is `ùìí·¥º·¥æ`
- Kleisli category
- Product category, `C √ó D`
- Coproduct category, `C + D`

Ctegories by special properties
- thin category: at most 1 morphism between any two objects
- concrete categories
- small categories
- large categories

Orders as categories
- preorder
- partial order
- linear order, total order

Special cats
- monoidal categories: categories with a single object
- locally small category: morphisms between any two objects form a set
- Kleisli category: a category based on a monad
- co-Kleisli category: a category based on a comonad
- opposite category
- bicategories

Distinguished categories
- 0-category, the empty category
- 1-category
- 2-category
