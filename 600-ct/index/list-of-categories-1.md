Types of categories
- discrete
- named


- category
- free category

- categories by special properties
  - thin category: at most 1 morphism between any two objects
  - concrete categories
  - small categories
  - large categories

- orders as categories
  - preorder
  - partial order
  - linear order, total order

- monoidal categories: categories with a single object
- locally small category: morphisms between any two objects form a set
- Kleisli category: a category based on a monad
- co-Kleisli category: a category based on a comonad
- opposite category
- bicategories

- Distinguished categories
  - the empty category
  - 1 category: 1 object, no arrows except identity
  - 2 category: 2 objects, no arrows except identities
