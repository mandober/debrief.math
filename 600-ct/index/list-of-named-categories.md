# Category theory :: Index :: List of named categories

Almost all mathematical structures, with appropriate structure-preserving maps, yields a category. Here are some categories with fairly standardized names.

## AbGrp
The category `AbGrp` with objects abelian groups and morphisms group homomorphisms, i.e. `(1, ×, (−)⁻¹)` homomorphisms.

## Bool
The category `Bool` with objects Boolean algebras and morphisms structure preserving homomorphisms, i.e. (⊤,⊥,∧,∨) homomorphisms.

## Diff
The category `Diff`
- objects: differential manifolds
- morphisms: smooth maps

## Fields
The category `Fields` with objects fields and morphisms fields homomorphisms, i.e. `(0,1,+,×)` homomorphisms.

## Fun
The category `Fun`
- objects: sets
- morphisms: typed functions
Non-standard.

## Grp
The category `Grp`
- objects: groups
- morphisms: group homomorphisms

The category `Grp` with objects groups and morphisms group homomorphisms, i.e. `(1, ×, (−)⁻¹)` homomorphisms.

## Heyt
The category `Heyt` with objects Heyting algebras and (⊤,⊥,∧,∨,→) homomorphisms.

## hoTop
The category `hoTop` with objects topological spaces and morphisms equivalence classes of homotopic functions.

This category is not only important in mathematical practice, it is at the core of algebraic topology, but it is also a fundamental example of a category in which morphisms are not structure preserving functions.

## Lat
The category `Lat` with objects lattices and morphisms structure preserving homomorphisms, i.e. (⊤,⊥,∧,∨) homomorphisms.

## Mon
The category `Mon`
- objects: monoids
- morphisms: monoid homomorphisms

## Par
The category `Par`
- objects: sets
- morphisms: partial functions on sets
Non-standard.

## Pord
The category `Pord` with objects preorders and morphisms monotone functions.

## PoSet
The category `PoSet` with objects posets and morphisms monotone functions.

## Rings
The category `Rings` with objects rings (with unit) and morphisms ring homomorphisms, i.e. `(0,1,+,×)` homomorphisms.

## Rel
The category `Rel`
- objects: sets
- morphisms: relations

## Set
The category `Set`
- objects: sets
- morphisms: (total) functions on sets

There are variants here: we can consider partial functions instead, injective, surjective, or bijective functions instead. Or, we can place each of these in their own category.

## Top
The category `Top` with objects topological spaces and morphisms continuous functions.

We could restrict morphisms to open continuous functions and obtain a different category.

## Vec
The category `Vec` with objects vector spaces and morphisms linear maps.
