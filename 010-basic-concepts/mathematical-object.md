# Mathematical object

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object

A mathematical object is an abstract concept arising in mathematics.

In the usual language of mathematics, *an object is anything that has a formal definition*, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs.

hmmâ€¦ I'd say mathematical objects introduced by a definition are only one class of mathematical objects, alongside mathematical primitives and mathematical axioms (which certainly don't have a formal definition but are "objects" nevertheless; particularly since the typical examples of math objects are in fact largely math primitives).

Typically, a mathematical object can be a value that can be assigned to a variable, and therefore can be involved in formulas. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers, sets, functions, expressions, geometric objects, transformations of other mathematical objects, and spaces. Mathematical objects can be very complex; for example, theorems, proofs, and even theories are considered as mathematical objects in proof theory.

Mathematical object is anything that can be formally defined and used in deductive reasoning and mathematical proof.

Although they are commonly called objects, these are absatract things also called mathematical concepts or ideas.

A mathematical object is an abstract object arising in mathematics. The concept is studied in philosophy of mathematics.

Common mathematical objects include permutations, combinations, partitions, relations, theorems, even proofs themselves.

With set theory (ZFC) at the foundation of mathematics, mathematical objects are defined in terms of sets.



Mathematical objects don't require proof, they come into existence by definitions alone. The definition should specify a complete description of the object it is introducuing.

*Discrete Structures* aid us in modelling the world in a way that enables us to think about it rigorously and computationally.

*Mathematical statements* have their own moderately complex taxonomy, being divided into:
- axioms
- conjectures
- theorems
- lemmas
- corollaries


An *axiom* or *postulate* is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.

A *conjecture* is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof or disproof has yet been found. Conjectures such as the `Riemann hypothesis` (still a conjecture) or `Fermat's Last Theorem` (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.

A *theorem* is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement.

A *lemma* is a proven proposition which is used as a stepping stone to a larger result rather than as a statement of interest by itself.

A *corollary* is a statement that readily follows from a previous statement or proof.
