# Complement laws

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)


Complement laws:
- `A ⋃ Aᶜ = 𝓤`
- `A ⋂ Aᶜ = ∅`
- `𝓤ᶜ = ∅` complement of the universal set is the empty set
- `∅ᶜ = 𝓤` complement of the empty set is the universal set
- `A ⊆ B -> Bᶜ ⊆ Aᶜ`
  follows from the equivalence of a conditional with its contrapositive, i.e. `p -> q` ≡ `¬q -> ¬p`
- complement is like negation `a ∨ ¬a = ⊤`, `a ∧ ¬a = ⊥`
