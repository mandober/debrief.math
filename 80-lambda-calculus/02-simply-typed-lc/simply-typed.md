# Simply typed lambda calculus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus


The Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, STLC or $$\lambda ^{\to }$$, is a typed interpretation of the lambda calculus (LC) with a single type constructor - the type constructor for functions, denoted by $$\to$$.

The STLC is the canonical and the simplest example of a typed lambda calculus. The term *simple type* is also used to refer to extensions of the STLC such as products, coproducts or natural numbers (System T) or even full recursion (PCF). In contrast, systems which introduce polymorphic types (System F) or dependent types (Logical Framework) are not considered simply typed. The former, except full recursion, are still considered *simple* because the Church encodings of such structures can be done using only the function type ctor and suitable type variables, while polymorphism and dependency cannot.
