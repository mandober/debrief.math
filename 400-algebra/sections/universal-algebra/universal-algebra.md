# Universal Algebra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra

**Universal algebra** studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples ("models") of algebraic structures. For instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes the class of groups as an object of study.

## Basic idea

In universal algebra, an algebra (or algebraic structure) 
is a set `A` together with a collection of operations on `A`.

An n-ary operation on `A` is a function that 
takes n elements of `A` and returns a single element of `A`.

* A 0-ary operation is a constant representing the element of `A`, and denoted by e.g. `a`.
* A 1-ary operation is a function `A -> A`, may be denoted by a prefix symbol, like `~x`.
* A 2-ary operation is often denoted by an infix symbol like `x ∗ y`.
* Operations of higher (or unspecified) arity are denoted using the regular notation for functions, e.g.`f(x,y,z)` or `f(x₁,...,xₙ)`.
* Some researchers allow infinitary operations, thus leading into the algebraic theory of complete lattices.

One way of talking about an algebra, 
is by referring to it as an algebra 
of a certain *type* `Ω`, 
where `Ω` is an ordered sequence 
of natural numbers 
representing the arity 
of the operations 
of the algebra.

## Equations

After the operations have been specified, 
the nature of the algebra is further defined by axioms, 
which in universal algebra often 
takes the form of identities, or equational laws.

An example is the associative axiom for a binary operation, 
given by the equation `∀x∀y∀z ∈ A` . `x ∗ (y ∗ z) = (x ∗ y) ∗ z`.

## Varieties

A collection of algebraic structures defined by identities is called a *variety or equational class*.
