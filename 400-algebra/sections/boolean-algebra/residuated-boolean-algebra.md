# Residuated Boolean algebra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residuated_Boolean_algebra

A **residuated Boolean algebra** is a *residuated lattice* 
whose lattice structure is that of a Boolean algebra.

Examples include
- Boolean algebras with the monoid taken to be conjunction
- the set of all formal languages over a given alphabet Î£ under concatenation
- the set of all binary relations on a given set X under relational composition
- and more generally the power set of any equivalence relation, again under relational composition.

The original application was to *relation algebras* as a finitely axiomatized generalization of the binary relation example, but there exist interesting examples of residuated Boolean algebras that are not relation algebras, such as the language example.
