# Two-element Boolean algebra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-element_Boolean_algebra

The two-element Boolean algebra is the Boolean algebra whose underlying set (universe, carrier) `B` is the Boolean domain, `B = {0, 1}`. Paul Halmos's name for this algebra `𝟚` is also common.

## Definition

* `B` is a partially ordered set and the elements of `B` are also its bounds
* An operation of arity `n` is a mapping `Bⁿ ⟼ B`
* Boolean algebra consists of two binary operations and unary complementation
* binary ops are called sum (`+`) and product (`∙`)
* Sum and product commute and associate
* `∙` precedes `+`, so `a ∙ b + c` ≡ `(a ∙ b) + c`
* *Complementation* is denoted with an apostrophe (or overbar), `x'`
* The numerical analog of the complement of `x` is `1 − x`
* BA is denoted by the 6-tuple `⟨B,+,∙,◌',1,0⟩` of type `⟨2,2,1,0,0⟩`
* Either one-to-one correspondence between `{0,1}` and `{True,False}` yields classical bivalent logic in equational form, with complementation read as NOT, `1` as True, `+` as OR and `∙` as AND (and vice versa, i.e. if 1 is read as False).
* These 2 ops define a commutative semiring, called the **Boolean semiring**.
