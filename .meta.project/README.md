- what it is about
- definition of the subject matter
- overview of the subject matter
  - objective overview: all that exists out there
  - (subjective) overview: what is presented here (in these notes)
- points of interest, index of
- subject matter classification
  - forking factors
    - opposing factors (opposing pairs)
    - orthogonal factors
    - misc other factors
  - actual hierarchy
    - actual classes
    - hierarchy of classes and subclasses
- entities involved, "the players", the description of
- properties
- attributes, principles, laws, identities
- actual (class') representatives, exploration of
  - actual (individual) concrete members/entities
