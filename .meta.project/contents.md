# Project Meta :: Contents

The subject matter of the overarching "project" `debris` is split into two tiers: theory and praxis.

The 'theory' tier includes notes and reference primarily about mathematics and computer science, and, to a lesser extent, about linguistics and philosophy.

The 'praxis' tier collects misc notes about the actual items and products (as practical implementations of their respecive underlying theories), like programming `lang`uages (Haskell, Agda, Rust, Lean, Idris, bash, JS), desktop and console `app`s, `shell` (general and conrete aspects of shells and terminals, operating systems, toolchains, subsystems, etc.), and `tech`nology (web technology, web design, UIs, UX, typography, unicode, latex, javascript ecosystem, virtualization, etc.).
