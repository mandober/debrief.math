# Axiomatic semantics

**Axiomatic semantics**, whereby one gives meaning to phrases by describing the axioms that apply to them.

Axiomatic semantics makes no distinction between a phrase's meaning and the logical formulas that describe it. Its meaning is exactly what can be proven about it in some logic.

The canonical example of axiomatic semantics is *Hoare logic*.
