# Entscheidungsproblem

The **Entscheidungsproblem**, or **the decision problem**, is a challenge posed by David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann in 1928.

The problem asks for an algorithm that considers (as input) a statement, then answers ("Yes" or "No")whether the statement is universally valid, i.e. valid in every structure satisfying the axioms.

By the *completeness theorem* of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid iff it can be deduced from the axioms, so the Entscheidungsproblem can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic.

In 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papers showing that a general solution to the Entscheidungsproblem is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notion of "effectively calculable" is captured by the functions computable by a Turing machine (or equivalently, by those expressible in the lambda calculus). This assumption is now known as the Churchâ€“Turing thesis.
