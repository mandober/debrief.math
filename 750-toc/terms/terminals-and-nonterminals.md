# Terminal and nonterminal symbols

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_and_nonterminal_symbols

Terminal and nonterminal symbols are the *lexical elements* used in specifying the *production rules* constituting a *formal grammar*.

**Terminal symbols** are the *elementary symbols* of the language defined by a formal grammar.

**Nonterminal symbols**, or *syntactic variables*, are replaced by groups of terminal symbols according to the production rules.

The terminals and nonterminals of a particular grammar are disjoint sets.
