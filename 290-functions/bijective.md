# Bijective

* A mapping that is both injective and surjective is called **bijective**.

* More precisely, a mapping that is first injection, then surjection, is a bijection. That's because surjection has a good and a bad property: its good property ensures that the entire codomain is involved in the mapping, but its bad property means that some elements of the codomain are double-mapped. This also means, that an injection can be upgraded to a bijection, which is not the case for surjection alone.

* Bijection means a mapping is both one-to-one and onto. It is a perfect mapping from one element of the domain to one element in the codomain, with the entire codomain involved in the mapping.

* Bijective mapping: `dom(f) = cod(f) = ran(f)`

* Bijective mapping is fully invertable; an `f` has an inverse mapping, `f⁻¹`, `f(a)=b -> ∀b ∈ B. f⁻¹(b)=a`.

* If the codomain of an injection `f` is shrinked to be equal to the range of `f`, the `f` would be bijective. So, an injection can be "upgraded" to a bijection, which cannot be done for surjection.
