# Lambda calculus :: History :: Short history

The lambda calculus was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics.

Church's original system was actually a system of logic, shown to be logically inconsistent in 1935 by Kleene and Rosser, which spawned the *Kleene-Rosser paradox*. Later Curry isolated the critical parts that produced the paradox which resulted in a similar *Curry's paradox*.

Subsequently, in 1936, Church isolated and published just the portion relevant to computation, discarding the logic operators, which is now called the *untyped lambda calculus*.

In 1940, Church also introduced a computationally weaker, but logically consistent system, known as the *simply typed lambda calculus*.

Until the 1960s when its relation to PLs was clarified, λ-calculus was only a formalism. Thanks to Richard Montague and other linguists' applications in the semantics of natural language, λ-calculus begun to enjoy a respectable place in both linguistics and CS.
