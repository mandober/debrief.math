# Lambda calculus :: by bullit point

* At its core, 位-calculus is just a notation that governs the definition of functions and their application.

* 位-calculus was a study of functions as rules.

* 位-calculus is a non-extensional theory of functions as rules of computation, contrasting with an extensional theory of functions as sets of ordered pairs.

* 位-calculus is a model of computation based on rewriting (substitution).

* The lambda calculus is a theory of functions as formulas. It is a system for manipulating functions as expressions. -- Lecture Notes on the Lambda Calculus by Peter Selinger (2001 - 2013)
