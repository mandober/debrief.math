# 位I-calculus

The **位I-calculus** is the name of an early variant of Church's 位-calculus in which every abstracted variable had to appear in the term's body.

This restriction means that, e.g. K combinator, `位ab.a`, could not be defined because the abstracted variable `b` doesn't appear in the body of the abstraction.
