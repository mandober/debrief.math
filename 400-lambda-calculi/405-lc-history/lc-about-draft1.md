# History of lambda calculus

## The times around the invention of lambda calculus

Lambda calculus is a mathematical formalism, invented by Alonzo Church in the end of 1920s, and this initial version was further shaped by Church and his students in the 1930s.


"...a formal system invented in the 1920s by Alonzo Church, in which all computation is reduced to the basic operations of function definition and application."

"Its importance arises from the fact that it can be viewed simultaneously as a simple programming language in which computations can be described and as a mathematical object about which rigorous statements can be proved."

## Inconsistency with dates

Almost every mention of LC seems to disagree about the actual year Church published how formalism. All these are in play: 1920's, 1932, 1936, 1937. Of course, as Church improved his original work he published the updates, but the year (let alone the date) of his first publication on the subject is vague.


"The simply-typed lambda calculus (or STLC) is a variant of the lambda calculus published by Church in 1940".


## Motive for inventing lambda calculus

to the matematical conference in 1900 in Paris, at which David Hilbert had shared his concerns that mathematics didn't rest on the solid foundations. Still fresh, set theory was considered for this role, but the solution to Russell's and similar paradoxes were still sought.

Lambda calculus is a formal language which facilitates the definition of the notion of computable functions.

Lambda calculus was developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s and is closely related to Alan Turing's reflections on the nature of computing. Namely, in 1928, David Hilbert has formulated a problem called the *Entscheidungsproblem*, in terms of logic knowns as *the decision problem*, and in terms of computing (later) knowns as *the halting problem*.

>Given a description of a formal language and a mathematical statement in that language, can it be determined if the statement is true or false.

An additional motivation for inventing lambda calculus was the investigation into the foundation of mathematics




1936-Apr Alonzo Church "An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory".

- 1937-Jan Alan Turing "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".


In general the class of functions definable by the calculus is equivalent to those computable by a Turing machine. The calculus has been influential in computer science and linguistics as well as in mathematics.

As well as the theoretical interest of the calculus, various attempts have been made to implement it as a practical computing system - each more or less directly. Among these languages Lisp, Scheme and Haskell are notably, and variously, related to lambda calculus.

The two central language constructs of the calculus are abstraction and application, which are the fundamental constructions. All other programming constructs differ in the way their evaluation strategies are implemented. Furthermore, its syntax can be further extended and simplified.
