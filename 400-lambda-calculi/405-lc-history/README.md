# Lambda Calculus :: General

1. History of lambda calculus
  - pre-history
    - Leibniz: creation of the universal math language with a decision 
      procedure that can solve all the problems stated in the language
    - Set theory by Cantor in 1874
  - the period around the invention (1930's)
    - decision problem
    - Entscheidungsproblem
  - reasons for invention
  - new models of computation
    - Church's lambda calculus
    - Turing's Turing machine
  - publications:
    - Alonzo Church, Apr 1936:
    `An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory`
    - Alan Turing, Jan 1937: 
      `On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem`
  - Intuitive explanation of computable functions
    - computable functions
    - Church-Turing Thesis
  - original lambda calculus
  - Church's intentions for the formalism
    - solving the Entscheidungsproblem
    - computable functions
    - exploration into the FOM
  - The correct year of invention of LC
  - The names of calculi
  - singular and plural forms of the noun
    - lambda calculus
    - lambda calculi
  - the article: indefinite, definite, the null article
    - a lambda calculus
    - the lambda calculus

2. The essence of mathematical functions
  - about lambda calculus
  - the essence of functions
  - mathematical functions
  - anatomy of a function
  - input-output behaviour of functions
  - currying


λ-calculus models
λ-calculus models lie behind much of the semantics of programming languages
