# Lambda calculus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus

Lambda calculus is a formal mathematical system and a notation for exploring mathematical functions. It is based on function abstraction and application.

Lambda calculus was invented by Alonzo Church 

Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.

Lambda calculus is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine.

Lambda calculus was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics.

Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them.

In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:

Lambda calculus (or λ-calculus) is both a generic name for a whole range of different formal systems, as well as the name for the untyped version of Church's lambda calculus, also called *untyped lambda calculus*.

In fact, ambiguity may still arise since Church had initially went through different designs, all under the same name, lambda calculus. Some sources use the term `λI calculus` as the name for one the early versions which forbade dropping formal parameters.

Later, more advanced variants of LC had names derived from the universal `λI calculus` form, inserting various symbols after the letter lambda, e.g. `λ→` is the simply typed lambda calculus, `λω` is a polymorphic lambda calculus, etc.
