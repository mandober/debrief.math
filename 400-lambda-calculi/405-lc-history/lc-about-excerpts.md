# λ-calculus

## Lambda calculus and combinators, an introduction
by J. Roger Hindley and Jonathan P. Seldin, 2008

* The λ-calculus was invented around 1930 by an American logician Alonzo Church, as part of a comprehensive logical system which included higher-order operators (operators which act on other operators). In fact the language of λ-calculus, or some other essentially equivalent notation, is a key part of most higher-order languages, whether for logic or for computer programming. Indeed, the first uncomputable problems to be discovered were originally described, not in terms of idealized computers such as Turing machines, but in λ-calculus.

* Combinatory logic has the same aims as λ-calculus, and can express the same computational concepts, but its grammar is much simpler. Its basic idea is due to two people: Moses Shonfinkel, who first thought of it in 1920, and Haskell Curry, who independently re-discovered it seven years later and turned it into a workable technique.




## Lambda calculus @ SEP

The λ-calculus is, at heart, a simple notation for functions and application. The main ideas are applying a function to an argument and forming functions by abstraction. The syntax of basic λ-calculus is quite sparse, making it an elegant, focused notation for representing functions. Functions and arguments are on a par with one another. The result is a non-extensional theory of functions as rules of computation, contrasting with an extensional theory of functions as sets of ordered pairs. Despite its sparse syntax, the expressiveness and flexibility of the λ-calculus make it a cornucopia of logic and mathematics. This entry develops some of the central highlights of the field and prepares the reader for further study of the subject and its applications in philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and logic.

In 1960 John McCarthy, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), combined elements of IPL with the lambda calculus (a formal mathematical-logical system) to produce the programming language LISP (List Processor), which remains the principal language for AI work in the United States.

The lambda calculus itself was invented in *1936* by the Princeton University logician Alonzo Church while he was investigating the abstract Entscheidungsproblem, or "decision problem," for predicate calculus - the same problem that the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing had been attacking when he invented the universal Turing machine.
