* "Combinatory logic and Î»-calculus were originally devised in the **1920s** for investigating the foundations of mathematics using the basic concept of operation instead of set." -- from `Lambda calculus and combinators, an introduction`, 2008, by J. Roger Hindley and Jonathan P. Seldin

* "It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the **1930s** as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics." -- from Wikipedia article at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus

* "The lambda calculus itself was invented in **1936** by the Princeton University logician Alonzo Church while he was investigating the abstract Entscheidungsproblem, or "decision problem," for predicate calculus - the same problem that the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing had been attacking when he invented the universal Turing machine."
