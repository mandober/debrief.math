# Typed lambda encoding schemes

Lambda encodings (such as Church encoding, Scott encoding, Parigot encoding) are methods to represent data in lambda calculus. Curry-Howard correspondence relates the formulas and proofs in intuitionistic logics to the types and programs in typed functional programming languages. Roughly speaking, type theory (Intuitionistic Type Theory) formulates the intuitionistic logic in the style of typed functional programming language.
