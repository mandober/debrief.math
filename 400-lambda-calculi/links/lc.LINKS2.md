The formal systems that are nowadays called lambda calculus and combinatory logic were both invented in the 1920s, and their aim was to describe the most basic properties of function: abstraction, application in terms of substitution in a very general setting. In lambda calculus, the concept of abstraction was taken as primitive, but in combinatory logic it was defined in terms of certain primitive operators called basic combinators. Today they are used extensively in higher-order logic and computing.

The shared history recognizes three main periods: initial, several years of intensive and very fruitful study in the 1920s and 1930s; the next was a middle period of nearly 30 years of relative quiet; then in the late 1960s an upsurge of activity stimulated by developments in higher-order function theory, on account of the correspondance to programming languages and by new technical discoveries.
