# Statistics :: GLOSSARY

## Confounding variable
In causal inference, a confounder (also confounding variable, confounding factor, extraneous determinant or lurking variable) is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association. Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations. The existence of confounders is an important quantitative explanation why correlation does not imply causation.

## Causal model
A causal model is a conceptual model that describes the causal mechanisms of a system. Causal models are mathematical models representing causal relationships within an individual system or population. They facilitate inferences about causal relationships from statistical data. Causal models can improve study designs by providing clear rules for deciding which independent variables need to be included/controlled for. Causal models can help with the question of external validity (whether results from one study apply to unstudied populations). Causal models can allow data from multiple studies to be merged (in certain circumstances) to answer questions that cannot be answered by any individual data set.

## Causal notation
In nature and human societies, many phenomena have causal relationships where one phenomenon A (a cause) impacts another phenomenon B (an effect). To describe causal relationships between phenomena, non-quantitative visual notations are common, such as arrows. Mathematical conventions are also used, such as plotting an independent variable on a horizontal axis and a dependent variable on a vertical axis, or the notation y=f(x) to denote that a quantity "y" is a dependent variable which is a function of an independent variable "x". Causal relationships are also described using quantitative mathematical expressions.

## Etiology
is the study of causation or origination. More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.

## Exogenous variable
An exogenous variable is one whose measure is determined outside the model and is imposed on the model. An exogenous change is a change in an exogenous variable.

## Endogenous variable
An endogenous variable is a variable whose measure is determined by the model. An endogenous change is a change in an endogenous variable in response to an exogenous change that is imposed upon the model.

## Dependent variable
Dependent variables are studied under the supposition or demand that they depend, by some law or rule (e.g. by a mathematical function), on the values of other variables. Between dependent and independent variables, it is always the former whose variation is being studied, by altering inputs, also known as regressors in a statistical context.

## Independent variable
Independent variables are not seen as depending on any other variable in the scope of the experiment in question. In this sense, some common independent variables are time, space, density, mass, fluid flow rate, and previous values of some observed value of interest (e.g. human population size) to predict future values (the dependent variable). In an experiment, any variable that can be attributed a value without attributing a value to any other variable is called an independent variable. Models and experiments test the effects that independent variables have on dependent variables. Sometimes, even if their influence is not of direct interest, independent variables may be included for other reasons, such as to account for their potential confounding effect.

## Observable
In physics, an observable is a physical property or physical quantity that can be measured. In classical mechanics, an observable is a real-valued "function" on the set of all possible system states, e.g. position and momentum. In quantum mechanics, an observable is an operator, or gauge, where the property of the quantum state can be determined by some sequence of operations.

## Phenomenon
In scientific use, a phenomenon is any event that is observable, including the use of instrumentation to observe, record, or compile data. Especially in physics, the study of a phenomenon may be described as measurements related to matter, energy, or time. The term φαινόμενον came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who contrasted it with the νοούμενoν which cannot be directly observed.

## Spatial statistics
is a field of applied statistics dealing with spatial data. It involves stochastic processes (random fields, point processes), sampling, smoothing and interpolation, regional (areal unit) and lattice (gridded) data, point patterns, as well as image analysis and stereology.
