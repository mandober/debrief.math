# Linear Regression

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression

In statistics, linear regression is a statistical model which estimates the linear relationship between a scalar response and one or more *explanatory variables* (also known as dependent and independent variables).

The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.

This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.

If the explanatory variables are measured with error then errors-in-variables models are required, also known as measurement error models.


Linear regression is a method for finding the straight line or hyperplane that best fits a set of points.
