## Chord
A chord of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circular arc. The infinite line extension of a chord is a secant.

## Disk
In geometry, a disk (disc) is the region of a plane bounded by a circle (region inside the circle). A closed disk includes the circle by which it is bounded. An open disk does not contain its bounding circle.

## Lemon
In geometry, rotating a 2-dimensional shape called lens, around the axis that goes through its tips, makes a 3-dimensional shape called a lemon.

## Lens
In geometry, a lens is, a 2-dimensional shape, a convex region bounded by two circular arcs joined to each other at their endpoints. In order for this shape to be convex, both arcs must bow outwards (convex-convex). This shape can be formed as the intersection of two circular disks. It can also be formed as the union of two circular segments (regions between the chord of a circle and the circle itself), joined along a common chord. A lens looks like `()`, i.e. the intersection of two circles, `⚭`.

## Lune
In plane geometry, a lune (Latin `luna` moon) is a 2-dimensional shape, a concave-convex region bounded by two circular arcs. It has one boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points moves outside the region and another boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points lies entirely inside the region. A convex-convex region is termed a lens. As an approximation, there are two symmetric lunes in `⚭` (the middle part is called a lens).

## Stadium
A stadium is a two-dimensional geometric shape constructed of a rectangle with semicircles at a pair of opposite sides. The same shape is known also as a pill shape, discorectangle, squectangle, obround, or sausage body. A stadium looks something like `O`; it became an extremely popular shape when CCS added the feature of rounding the corners.
