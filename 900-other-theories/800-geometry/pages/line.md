# Geometry :: Line

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)

In geometry, a line is an infinitely long object with no width, depth, or curvature. Thus, lines are one-dimensional objects, though they may exist embedded in two, three, or higher dimensional spaces.

A line is uniquely defined to by any two distinct points that lie on. A line may be referred by those points as AB, or by a single letter, ℓ.

*Euclidean line* and *Euclidean geometry* are terms introduced to avoid confusion with generalizations introduced since the end of the 19th century, such as non-Euclidean, projective, and affine geometry.

## Properties

When geometry was first formalised by Euclid in the "Elements", he defined a *general line* (now called a *curve*) to be "breadthless length" with a straight line being a line "which lies evenly with the points on itself".

These definitions serve little purpose since they use terms that are not themselves defined. In fact, Euclid himself did not use these definitions in his work and probably included them just to make it clear to the reader what was being discussed.

In modern geometry, *a line is simply taken as an undefined object with properties given by axioms*,  but it is sometimes defined as a set of points obeying a *linear relation* when some other fundamental concept is left undefined.

Euclid's original axioms contained various flaws that have been corrected by the modern axiomatic formulation of Euclidean geometry.

In the *Hilbert's axiomatic formulation of Euclidean geometry*, a line is stated to have certain properties that relate it to other lines and points.
- for any two distinct points, there is a unique line containing them
- any two distinct lines intersect at most at one point

In 2D (i.e. in Euclidean plane), two lines that do not intersect are called *parallel*.

In higher dimensions, two lines that do not intersect are called *parallel* if they are contained in a plane, or *skew* if they are not.

In Euclidean plane, a line may represent a boundary between two regions.

Any collection of finitely many lines partitions the plane into *convex, possibly unbounded, polygons*; this partition is known as an **arrangement of lines**.
