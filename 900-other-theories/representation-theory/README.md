# Representation theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory

**Representation theory** studies abstract algebraic structures 
by representing their elements as linear transformations of vector spaces, 
and studies *modules* over these abstract algebraic structures.

In essence, a representation 
makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete 
by describing its elements by matrices 
and their algebraic operations 
(for example, matrix addition, matrix multiplication).

The *theory of matrices* and *theory of linear operators* 
is well-understood, so representations 
of more abstract objects in terms 
of the familiar objects of *linear algebra* 
helps glean properties and simplify calculations 
on more abstract theories.
