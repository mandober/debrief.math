# Elementary algebra


Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.

Algebra gives methods for writing formulas and solving equations that are much clearer and easier than the older method of writing everything out in words.
