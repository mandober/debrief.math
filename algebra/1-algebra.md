# Algebra


## άλγεβρα
Algebra, in its most general form, is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a reoccurring subject in math, as it includes everything from equation solving to the study of the higher mathematical abstractions.

*Elementary algebra* is the more basic parts of algebra; it is taught in primary school as it is a useful skill in any profession.

*Abstract algebra* contains more advanced parts of algebra and studies mathematical abstractions such as groups, rings, fields, lattice, manifolds, etc. It is primarily engaged by the (professional) mathematicians.

The word algebra is also used to denote a special mathematical object: an *algebraic structure*, a structure on a carrier set (usually with addition, multiplication and a scalar multiplication), is a set of finitary operations on that carrier set; a set with such additional structure is called an *algebra*.

The word is also used in phrases: linear algebra and algebraic topology.

*Linear algebra* is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as linear functions such as and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.

*Algebraic topology* is a branch of mathematics that uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism, though usually most classify up to homotopy equivalence.

A mathematician who does research in algebra is called an *algebraist*.


## Meanings of algebra
In math, the word "algebra" has several related meanings:
* Without an article, *algebra* names a broad part of math.
* With an article (or in plural), *an algebra* (or *algebras*) denotes a specific mathematical structure.
* With a qualifier, it means a part of algebra, such as *linear algebra*, *elementary algebra* or *abstract algebra*.
* When the article is also present, it means an instance of some abstract structure, like *a Lie algebra*, *an associative algebra* or *a vertex operator algebra*.
* Sometimes both meanings exist for the same qualifier, as in: *Commutative algebra* is the study of commutative rings, which are *commutative algebras* over the integers.


## MSC
Algebra has grown to include many branches of mathematics, as can be seen in the *Mathematics Subject Classification*.
