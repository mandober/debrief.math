# Diagram

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram_(category_theory)

A diagram is the categorical analogue of an indexed family in set theory. The primary difference is that in the categorical setting one has morphisms that also need indexing.

An indexed family of sets is
- a collection of sets indexed by a fixed set, i.e.
- a function from a fixed index set to the class of sets

A diagram is
- a collection of objects and morphisms indexed by a fixed category, i.e.
- a functor from a fixed *index category* to an *indexed category*

The *universal functor of a diagram* is the *diagonal functor*; its right adjoint is the limit of the diagram and its left adjoint is the colimit.

The natural transformation from the diagonal functor to some arbitrary diagram is called a *cone*.
