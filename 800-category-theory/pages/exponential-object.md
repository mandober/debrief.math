# Exponential object

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object

An **exponential object** or **map object** is the categorical generalization of a function space from set theory.

Categories with all finite products and exponential objects are called *cartesian closed categories* (CCC).

Categories (such as subcategories of Top) without adjoined products may still have an exponential law.
