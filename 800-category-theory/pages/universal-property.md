# Universal property

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_property

A universal property is a property which is satisfied by a [universal morphism](./universal-morphism.md), which may also be thought of more abstractly as the [initial object](./initial-object.md) or [terminal object](./terminal-object.md) of a comma category.

Universal properties occur almost everywhere in mathematics, and hence the precise category theoretic concept helps point out similarities between different branches of mathematics, some of which may even seem unrelated.

Universal properties may be used in other areas of mathematics implicitly, but the abstract and more precise definition of it can be studied in category theory.



a universal property is an important property which is satisfied by a universal morphism (see Formal Definition). Universal morphisms can also be thought of more abstractly as initial or terminal objects of a comma category (see Connection with comma categories). Universal properties occur almost everywhere in mathematics, and hence the precise category theoretic concept helps point out similarities between different branches of mathematics, some of which may even seem unrelated.

Universal properties may be used in other areas of mathematics implicitly, but the abstract and more precise definition of it can be studied in category theory.

This article gives a general treatment of universal properties. To understand the concept, it is useful to study several examples first, of which there are many: all free objects, direct product and direct sum, free group, free lattice, Grothendieck group, Dedekind-MacNeille completion, product topology, Stone-ÄŒech compactification, tensor product, inverse limit and direct limit, kernel and cokernel, pullback, pushout and equalizer.
