# Duality

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIc0K81yz6E

In this video we introduce the idea of *duality*, and the notion of the *opposite category*. We define the *initial object* of a category, and show that it can be viewed as the empty set, within the category of sets. We also introduce the idea of the *coproduct* and show that it corresponds to the discriminated union, within the category of sets. We also show how the Cartesian product can be viewed as a functor in the category of sets. More generally, we show that the *categorical product* can be viewed as a functor, when the categorical product of each pair of objects is defined. This also gives us a notion of the *categorical product of a pair of arrows*.

## Duality and opposite categories

The **opposite category** of a category `C` is the category `Cᴼᴾ` where all arrows of C are reversed.
