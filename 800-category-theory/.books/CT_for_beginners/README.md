Category theory is close to the perfect language. It can be used to describe many mathematical ideas, and see the relations between them, and their deeper structure. This is the first video in a course where we will carefully introduce the main ideas of category theory, and motivate them with lots of applications. This first video gives the definition of a category and give some motivation for studying the subject. In particular we define a category, give the definition of a monoid, we define a pre-ordered set (preorder), we define the category Set, of sets and functions. We introduce functional programming. We define the final object (terminal object), and explain how the ideas can be used to do set theory without considering the elements within sets directly.
