# Universal Properties

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9tMzmlpuYo

This video explores
- universal properties
- universal morphisms
- initial/terminal properties
- initial/terminal morphisms
- exponential object
- natural number object
- comma categories

I illustrate how the product can be viewed as a universal morphism. I define an exponential object, and discuss how it corresponds to a universal morphism. I also define a natural number object, and describe how it corresponds to the set of natural numbers in the category of sets. I also define comma categories, and describe how universal morphisms correspond to initial/terminal objects within them. I also show that the natural number object corresponds to a universal morphism using a new proof. The proof is given in the unlisted video at:
