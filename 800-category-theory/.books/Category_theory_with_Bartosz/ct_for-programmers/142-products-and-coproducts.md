* The only way to single out (reference, select) a particular object in a category is by describing the relations it has with other objects and itself. These relationships are defined by morphisms.

* **Universal construction** is a common construction in category theory for defining objects in terms of their relations. One way to do it, is to pick a *pattern* (i.e. a particular shape constructed from objects and morphisms) and find all occurrences of this pattern in the category. For a common pattern (and a large category) there will be lots of "hits". The problem is then how to rank them; we need to establish some kind of ranking that will help us discover the best candidate (Google uses PageRank technology for the same problem).
