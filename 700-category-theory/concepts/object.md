## Definition

A category consists of a collection of objects together with morphisms between these objects. Thus, naively, we may think of objects as the ‘elements’ of a category.

More generally, in higher category theory the objects of an (n,r)-category are the 0-dimensional cells of that structure, the 0-morphisms.

## Examples

If a set is regarded as a discrete category (with no nontrivial morphisms) then the objects of that category are precisely the elements of the set.

In the fundamental groupoid Π1(X) of a topological space X, the objects are the points of X.

In the category Set, the objects are sets; in Vect the objects are vector spaces; in Top the objects are topological spaces, etc.

If a simplicial set that is a Kan complex is regarded as an ∞-groupoid, then its vertices are the objects of that ∞-groupoid.

Similarly if a simplicial set that is a quasi-category is regarded as an (∞,1)-category, then its vertices are the objects of that (∞,1)-category.

If a globular set is equipped with the structure of a strict ∞-category, then its 0-cells are the objects of that ∞-category.
