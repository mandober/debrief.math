**Kleisli category**, named after the mathematician Heinrich Kleisli, is a category naturally associated to any monad `T`. It is equivalent to the category of free *`T`-algebras*.

The Kleisli category is one of two extremal solutions to the question: 
*Does every monad arise from an adjunction?*

The other extremal solution is the *Eilenbergâ€“Moore category*.
