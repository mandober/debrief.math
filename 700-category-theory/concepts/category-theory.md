## Category Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory


Category theory formalizes *mathematical structure* and its concepts in terms of a *labeled directed graph* called a **category**, whose nodes are called **objects**, and whose labelled directed edges are called **arrows** or **morphisms**.


A category has two basic properties:
* the ability to compose the arrows associatively
* the existence of an identity arrow for each object

The language of category theory has been used to formalize concepts of other high-level abstractions such as sets, rings, and groups.

Informally, category theory is a general theory of functions.

In category theory, morphisms obey conditions specific to category theory itself.

Category theory has practical applications in programming language theory, for example the usage of monads in functional programming.

Category theory may be used as an axiomatic foundation for mathematics (as an alternative to set theory and other proposed foundations).
