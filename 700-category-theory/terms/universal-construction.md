# Universal construction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_construction


In category theory, a **universal property** is a property which is satisfied by a *universal morphism*.

Universal morphisms can also be thought of more abstractly as *initial* or *terminal objects* of a *comma category*.

Universal properties occur almost everywhere in mathematics, and hence the precise category theoretic concept helps point out similarities between different branches of mathematics, some of which may even seem unrelated. Universal properties may be used in other areas of mathematics implicitly, but the abstract and more precise definition of it can be studied in category theory.
