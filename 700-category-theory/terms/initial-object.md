# Initial Object

**Initial object** is an object without incoming arrows, there are only outgoing arrows. There may be more than one initial object or it might not exist at all.

The notion of **object precedence** qualifies object `a` as being *"more initial"* than object `b` if there is an arrow `a -> b`.
