# Lambda Calculus :: General

1. Pre-history of lambda calculus 
  - Leibniz
    - universal language
    - decision procedure to solve logic problems
    - Calculemus!
  - Cantor
    - set theory 1874
  - Frege
    - predicate logic
    - set theory
  - Bernard Russell
    - Russell's paradox (Entscheidungsproblem for sets)
  - Kurt Goedel
    - System T
    - Primitive recursive functions
    - incompleteness theorem (Entscheidungsproblem for arith and logic systems)

  - Set theory
    - equality of sets
    - intensional view of equality
    - extensional view of equality
    - functions as sets
    - functions as rules (procedures, black boxes)
    - aspects of functions
      - currying
      - recursion
      - computability
      - halting

- 1930's - math of the period
  - decision problem, Entscheidungsproblem
  - reasons for inventing LC
  - new models of computation
    - Lambda Calculus by Church
    - Turing Machine by Turing
    - General recursion by Goedel
    - PRF and General recursion by Kleen
  - Computability
    - Intuitive explanation of computable functions
    - computable functions
    - Church-Turing Thesis
  - Original lambda calculus (as a system of logic)
    - Church's intentions for this first version of the formalism
    - solving Entscheidungsproblem
    - computable functions
    - exploration into the FOM
    - The (correct) date of the invention of LC
    - Other versions of the LC
    - lambda calculi
      - The names of lambda calculi
      - singular and plural forms of the noun
        - lambda calculus
        - lambda calculi
      - the article: indefinite, definite, the null article
        - a lambda calculus
        - the lambda calculus
        - lambda calculus

2. LC and mathematical functions
  - the essence of functions
  - the essence of mathematical functions
  - anatomy of a function
  - input-output behaviour of functions
  - currying


- λ-calculus models
  - λ-calculus models lie behind much of the semantics of FPLs
