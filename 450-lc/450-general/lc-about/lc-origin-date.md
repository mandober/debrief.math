- Alonzo Church, Apr 1936 "An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory".
- Alan Turing, Jan 1937, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".


## Church first

The dates when LC first appeared are still a mystery. Moreover, there have been many versions that Church initially produced augmenting the confusion of when the formalism (and which ione precidely) was first published. In any case, it seems that Church has published the first paper related to LC *before* Turing published his seminal paper about TM. Thus, LC was invented prior to TMs although the two models of computation are equivelant.

## Excerpts about the date of first appearance

* "Combinatory logic and Î»-calculus were originally devised in the **1920s** for investigating the foundations of mathematics using the basic concept of operation instead of a set." -- from `Lambda calculus and combinators, an introduction`, by J. Roger Hindley and Jonathan P. Seldin, 2008.

* "Lambda calculus was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the **1930s** as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics." -- from Wikipedia article about Lambda calculus

* "The lambda calculus itself was invented in **1936** by the Princeton University logician Alonzo Church while he was investigating the abstract Entscheidungsproblem, or "decision problem," for predicate calculus - the same problem that the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing had been attacking when he invented the universal Turing machine." -- Artificial intelligence programming language @ Enc Britannica
