# Functions in lambda calculus



In math, a function has two aspects: a function definition and function application.

First, a function needs to be defined and in mathematical notation this looks like `f(x) = x + 1`. A function definition is also called function abstraction.

The other face is function application, e.g. `f(3)`, where the previously defined function bound to a variable (identifier) `f` is applied to an argument, `3` in this case.
