# Normal forms

Normal forms are a concept in logic, formal languages, lambda calculi, PLs, and other math disciplines that involve *rewriting systems*.

A **canonical form** or **standard form** of a mathematical object is a standard way of presenting the object as a mathematical expression. Often, it is a form which provides the simplest representation of an object and allows it to be identified in a unique way, thereby also facilitating comparison.

The distinction between "canonical" and "normal" forms may vary across math fields. In most fields, a *canonical form* specifies a unique representation for every object, while a *normal form* specifies a representation for every object without the requirement of uniqueness.

The canonical form of a positive integer in decimal representation is a finite sequence of digits that does not begin with zero. More generally, for a class of objects on which an *equivalence relation* is defined, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each equivalence class. The chosen representative is an arbitrary, agreed-upon element. Every element of an *equivalence class* characterizes the class, and may be used to represent it. When such an element is chosen, it is called a **representative** of the quivalence class.

A canonical form of an exp may not necessarily be equivalent to the original exp in every aspect. For example, skolem normal form only preserves satisfiability (the resulting exp is satisfiable iff the original exp is).

**Canonicalization** is the process through which a representation of an exp is put into its canonical form. Thus, the equality of two exps can easily be determined by testing the equality of their canonical forms.

A canonical form may simply be a convention, or a deep theorem. For example, polynomials are conventionally written with the terms in descending powers: it is more usual to write x² + x + 30 than x + 30 + x², although the two forms define the same polynomial. By contrast, the existence of Jordan canonical form for a matrix is a deep theorem.

It is often said that "in mathematics, canonical form denotes a form, usually the simplest or most symmetrical, to which, without loss of generality, all functions of the same class can be reduced."
