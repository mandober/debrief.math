# Lambda calculus :: Indices

- Lambda terms
  - abs
  - app
  - var
    - occurrences of a var in abs
      - binding occurrences
        - exactly 1 occurrences in the lambda head (aka formal parameter)
      - applied occurrences
        - bound
          - 0 or more occurrences in the lambda body (aka actual parameter)
        - free
          - 0 or more occurrences in the lambda body
          - parameter bound in some external scope
    - occurrences of a var in app
      - in app, left lambda term is abs, right is an arg
      - var may be the argument itself
      - or appear within the arg M
        - important if var `x` is free or not in arg `M`, `x ∉ FV(M)`

- Lambda rules (axioms)
  - conversions
    - α-conversion
      - α-equivalence
    - η-conversion
      - η-expansion
      - η-contraction
  - reductions
    - β-reduction
  - (other rules)
    - δ-rule
    - ζ-rule


- Type inference
  - types a la Church
    - exlicit typing
    - type checking - types are just read off
    - each term has exactly 1 type
  - types a la Curry
    - implicit typing
    - types are inferred
    - each term has exactly at least 1 type
    - in HM, each term has exactly 1 principal type
    - in general, undecidable beyond System F

- Reduction strategies
  - applicative order
    - rightmost innermost
    - evaluate args before app
  - normal order
    - leftmost outermost
    - do not evaluate args before app
  - strict
    - eager
    - call-by-value
  - non-strict
    - lazy
    - call-by-name
      - call-by-name w/sharing
      - call-by-need

- Normal forms
  - beta normal form
  - head normal form
  - weak-head normal form

- Encoding schemes
  - Church encoding
    - Church Booleans
    - Church Numbers (Church Numerals)
      - Church Naturals
        - Rosser's predecessor via pairs, O(n)
      - Arithmetic ops
      - Church Integers
      - Church Rationals
    - Church ADTs
      - Church Pair
      - Church List
        - tail is O(n)
  - Scott encoding
    - Scott Naturals
    - Scott List
    - Scott ADTs
  - Encoding numbers (naturals)
    - Church Naturals
    - Scott Naturals
    - Parigot Naturals
    - Alt-encoded naturals
