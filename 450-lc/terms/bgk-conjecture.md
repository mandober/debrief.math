# Barendregt-Geuvers-Klop conjecture

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barendregt-Geuvers-Klop_conjecture

The **Barendregt-Geuvers-Klop (BGK) conjecture** is an unsolved problem in computer science.

In the branches of mathematical logic known as proof theory and type theory, a *pure type system (PTS)*, previously known as a generalized type system (GTS), is a form of typed lambda calculi that allows an arbitrary number of sorts and dependencies between them.


The systems from the lambda cube are all known to be *strongly normalizing*. Pure type systems in general need not be, for example `System U` from Girard's paradox is not (roughly speaking, Girard found pure systems in which one can express the sentence "the types form a type").

Furthermore, all known examples of pure type systems that are not strongly normalizing are not even (weakly) normalizing: they contain expressions that do not have normal forms, just like the untyped lambda calculus. 

It is a major open problem in the field whether this is always the case, i.e. whether a (weakly) normalizing PTS always has the strong normalization property. This is known as the **Barendregt-Geuvers-Klop conjecture** [10] (named after Henk Barendregt, Herman Geuvers, and Jan Willem Klop).
