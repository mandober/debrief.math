## The Lambda Calculus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)

At the core, 位-calculus is just a notation that governs the definition of functions and their application.

The main ideas are applying a function to an argument and forming functions by abstraction.

The syntax of basic 位-calculus is quite sparse, making it an elegant, focused
notation for representing and analyzing functions.

Functions and arguments are on a par with one another.

位-calculus is a non-extensional theory of functions as rules of computation, contrasted with an extensional theory of functions as sets of ordered pairs.

Despite its sparse syntax, the expressiveness and flexibility of the 位-calculus
make it a cornucopia of logic and mathematics.

This entry develops some of the central highlights of the field and prepares the reader for further study of the subject and its applications in philosophy,
linguistics, computer science, and logic.
