## Paradoxes in contemporary logic

In the 1920's, the orthodox view of logic among mathematicians was mostly type or set theoretic. Despite this, there was a renewed effort to develop new logics as substitutes for the logic of "Principia Mathematica".

Combinatory logic (CL) and lambda calculus (LC) have intially attempted to regain the simplicity of the untyped approach, originating in the so-called naive comprehension principle, but also to investigate the foundations of mathematics using the basic concept of operation, rather then set, as well as to clarify the fundamental concepts underlying the notions of formal systems, formalisms and rules. Both systems have since evolved, becoming important tools for development and study of PLs.

In particular, A. Church and H. Curry have proposed theories that assume as primitive the notion of self-applicable *function-in-intension* and emphasize the notation for defining and combining concepts.
