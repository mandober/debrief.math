# Topology

Topology is the study of how topological spaces and their properties are preserved under homeomorhpism.

- topological spaces are transformed using continuous maps
- continuous maps are arrows in the category of topological spaces
- we need arrows to understand functors
- we need functors to understand natural transformations
- we need natural transformations to understand adjoint functors

...so as you can see topology has a number of applicaitons

(Definition) A **topology** `T` on `X` is a family of sets in `X` such that
- `∅ ∈ T` and `X ∈ T`
- the possibly infinite union of any sets in `T`, is in `T`
- the finite intersection of any sets in `T`, is in `T`
