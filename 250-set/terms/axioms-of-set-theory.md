# Axioms of set theories


1. The Axiom of Extensionality
  - The Axiom of Extension
  - The Axiom of Extent
  - ∀x . (x ∈ A ⟺ x ∈ B) ⟺ A = B
  - defines sets (as objects determined by their elements)
  - defines set equality through subset (inclusion) relation
- The Axiom of Union (flat set: containing all elements of nested sets)
- The axiom of specification
- The Axiom of Pairing (pair of sets as elements in third)
- The axiom of powers
- The axiom of infinity
- The axiom of substitution
- The axiom of choice (AC) (choose 1 elem out of any non-empty subset)
- The Axiom of well-ordering (added to turn ZF into ZFC)
- The Axiom of Regularity (disjoint sets)
- The axiom of foundation (disjoint sets)
- Axiom Schema of Specification
- Axiom of Union
  for every collection of sets, there exists a set that contains all the elements that belong to at least one of the sets in the collection.
- Axiom of Replacement
  for any set $$S$$, there exists a set $$x$$ such that, for any element $$y$$ of $$S$$, if there exists an element $$z$$ satisfying the condition $$P(y,z)$$, where $$P(y,z)$$ is a propositional function, then such $$z$$ appear in $$x$$.
- Axiom of the Empty Set
  there exists a set that has no elements.
- Axiom of Subsets
  for every set and every condition, there corresponds a set whose elements are exactly the same as those elements of the original set for which the condition is true.
- Axiom of Powerset
  for each set there exists a collection of sets that contains amongst its elements all the subsets of the given set.
- Axiom of Infinity
  there exists a set containing a set with no elements and the successor of each of its elements.
- Axiom of Foundation
  for all non-null sets, there is an element of the set that shares no member with the set.
- Axiom of Choice
  for every set, we can provide a mechanism for choosing one element of any non-empty subset of the set.
