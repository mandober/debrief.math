# path

A **path** in a graph is a finite or infinite sequence of adjacent edges, in which all vertices are distinct (and so are all the edges).

That is, a path is a walk in which all vertices are distinct. 
Some authors do not require that all vertices of a path be distinct; they use the term **simple path** for such a path.

A **directed path** or **dipath**, in a directed graph, is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of distinct vertices, but with all the edges directed in the same direction.

**The weight of a path** in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the traversed edges.
