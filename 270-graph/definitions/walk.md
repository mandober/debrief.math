# walk

A **walk** or **chain** in a graph is a finite or infinite sequence of adjacent edges (which joins a sequence of vertices).

Openness
- a **closed walk** is a walk with the same first and last vertex.
- an **open walk** is walk with distinct first and last vertex.

Distinctness
- a **trail** is a walk with distinct edges.
- a **path** is a trail with distinct vertices (thus distinct edges).

Finitness
- an **finite walk** is a walk that has a first and last vertex.
- an **infinite walk** is a walk without a first and last vertex.
- a **semi-infinite walk** or a **ray** has a first but no last vertex.

Weigthedness
- in a weighted graph, the **weight of a walk** is the sum of the weights of the traversed (weighted) edges.
