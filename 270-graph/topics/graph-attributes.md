# Graph attributes

* Graph attributes
  - order                   number of vertices
  - size                    number of edges
  - diameter                max distance between a pair of vertices
  - radius                  min eccentricity of any vertex
  - circumference
  - girth
  - clique number
  - minimum degree
  - maximum degree
  - connectivity
  - automorphisms
  - chromatic number
* Graph properties
  - bipartite
  - regular
  - biregular
  - self-complementary
  - complete

* Vertex properties
  - eccentricity: max distance from a given to any other vertex
  - distance: shortest path length with the two vertices as its endpoints
