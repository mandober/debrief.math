# Graph theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory

**Graph theory** is an area of mathematicas concerned with the study of graphs. A **graph** is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects consisting of vertices connected by edges. A **vertex** is a node that may have any number of associated edges (even zero). An **edge** is a connection between two distinct vertices.

A common but very imprecise definition of a graph, or a precise definition of *undirected simple graph*, is that of an ordered pair `𝓖 = ⟨𝓥,𝓔⟩`, where both pair components are sets:
- `𝓥`, set of vertices
- `𝓔`, set of edges, where each edge connects two vertices

Since edges may be directed or undirected so does the graph containg them. An *undirected edge* may be understood to represent a symmetrical relation, while a *directed edge* represent a asymmetrical relation. Thus, in an undirected graph, edges link vertices symmetrically, while in a directed graph, edges link vertices asymmetrically.

- graph, `𝓖`
- set of vertices, `𝓥`
- set of edges, `𝓔`
- vertex:
  - vertices: `∀A,B ∈ 𝓥`
  - distinct: `∀A,B ∈ 𝓥 ⋀ A ≠ B`
- edge:
  - membership: `x ∈ 𝓔` for x = AB
  - `𝓔 ⊆ { {A,B} | A,B ∈ 𝓥 ⋀ A ≠ B }`
  - `𝓔 ⊆ { ⟨A,B⟩ | A,B ∈ 𝓥 ⋀ A ≠ B }`
  - undirected:
    - 
    - `{A,B}` undirected edge between A and B vertices
  - directed: 
    - `⟨A,B⟩` directed edge from vertex A to B


```
𝓖 = ⟨𝓥,𝓔⟩
𝓥 =
𝓔 = 
```


∃AB ∈ 𝓥. ∃x ∈ 𝓔. x = {A,B}
∃AB ∈ 𝓥. ∃x ∈ 𝓔. x = ⟨A,B⟩




- edges are unordered pairs of vertices
- an edge is associated with two distinct vertices
