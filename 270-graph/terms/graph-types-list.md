# Graph types

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphs_by_edges_and_vertices

- directed vs undirected
- disconnected vs connected
- cyclic vs acyclic
- rooted vs unrooted



Types of graphs:
* Connected: graph with a path between each pair of vertices.
* Forest: An acyclic graph.
* Directed acyclic graph (DAG): directed graph with no cycles.
* Sparse graph: graph in which `|E| ? |V|2`.
* Eulerian graph: graph that has an Euler tour
* Biconnected: cannot be disconnected by removal of a single vertex.
* Bipartite: 
  graph in which the vertex set can be partitioned into two sets X and Y, such that each edge connects a node in X with a node in Y.
* Strongly connected: 
  directed graph in which there is a directed path in each direction between 
  each pair of vertices.
