# Combinatorics and Graph theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#Graph_theory


Graphs are fundamental objects in combinatorics.

Considerations of graph theory range across
- enumeration, e.g. the number of graphs on `n` vertices with `k` edges
- existing structures like *Hamiltonian cycles*
- algebraic representations, e.g. given a graph `G` and two numbers `x` and `y`, does the *Tutte polynomial* `Tá´³(x,y)` have a combinatorial interpretation?

Although there are very strong connections between graph theory and combinatorics, they are sometimes thought of as separate subjects.

While combinatorial methods apply to many graph theory problems, the two disciplines are generally used to seek solutions to different types of problems.
