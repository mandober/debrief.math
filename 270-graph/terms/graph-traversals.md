- Walk: finite or infinite sequence of *adjacent edges* which joins a sequence of vertices.
- Path: a walk with distinct vertices

finite or infinite sequence of *adjacent edges* which joins a sequence of *distinct vertices* (and since vertices are distinct so are edges).



         | adjacent | unique |
edges    | walk     | path   |
