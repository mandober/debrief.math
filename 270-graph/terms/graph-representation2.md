# Graph representation

https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs

There are several ways to represent graphs, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Different algorithms call for different representation and a different set of criteria.

Requirements
* Space (memory): we use asymptotic notation since it has purposes other than just expressing the time complexity (i.e. running time) - it is a general way to characterize a function after all. And functions can describe the cost in terms of memory or time requirements.
* Time: the other two criteria we'll use relate to time. One is how long it takes to determine whether a given edge is in the graph. The other is how long it takes to find the neighbors of a given vertex.
