# Quiver

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiver_(mathematics)

A **quiver** is a directed graph where loops and multiple arrows between two vertices are allowed, making a quiver a *multidigraph*.

Quivers are commonly used in *representation theory*: a representation `V` of a quiver assigns a vector space `V(x)` to each vertex `x` of the quiver and a linear map `V(a)` to each arrow `a`.

In category theory, a quiver can be understood as the *underlying structure of a category*, but lacking composition or a designation of identity morphisms. That is, there is a *forgetful functor* from `Cat` to `Quiv` categories; its left *adjoint* is a free functor which, from a quiver, makes the corresponding free category.
