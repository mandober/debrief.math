# Graphs theory :: Graph attributes

Graph attributes
- order              number of vertices in a graph, `|V|`
- size               number of edges in a graph,    `|E|`
- diameter           max distance between a pair of vertices, graph-wise
- radius             min eccentricity of any vertex, graph-wise
- circumference
- girth
- clique number
- connectivity
- automorphisms
- chromatic number
- minimum degree
- maximum degree

* Graph properties
  - bipartite
  - regular
  - biregular
  - self-complementary
  - complete

* Vertex properties
  - degree: number of edges of node V in an undirected graph
    - in-degree: number of incoming edges of node V in a digraph
    - out-degree: number of outgoing edges of node V in a digraph
  - eccentricity: max distance from a given to any other vertex
  - distance: shortest path length with the two vertices as its endpoints
