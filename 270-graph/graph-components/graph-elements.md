# Graph elements

- vertex
  - adjecent vertices: distinct endpoints of the same edge, o-------o
  - neighbors: vertices adjacent to a given vertex
  - neighborhood: all adjacent vertices to a given vertex
- edge
  - line: undirected edge
  - arc: directed edge
  - arrow: directed edge (x,y) with tail x and head y
  - weighted edge
  - adjecent: distinct edges that share an endpoint, ----o----
- graph
  - visual representation of relations
- sequences of vertices and edges
  - path: sequence of adjacent vertices and edges
  - walk, chain: sequence of edges joining a sequence of vertices

- cycle: non-empty path from a node to itself
- girth: the length of a graph's shortest cycle
