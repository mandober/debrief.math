# Edge list

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_list

An **edge list** is a list-based graph representation as a list of edges. An (unweighted) edge is a pair of vertices, `(u,v)`, where `u` is its start point and `v` its endpoint.

The entire edge list may be represented as a two-column matrix.

An edge list may be considered a variation on an adjacency list which is represented as a length `|V|` array of lists.

Since each edge contains just two or three numbers, the total space for an edge list is `Î˜(e)` where `e` is the number of edges.
