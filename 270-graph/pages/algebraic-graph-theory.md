# Algebraic graph theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_graph_theory

In algebraic graph theory, algebraic methods are applied to graph problems, as opposed to geometric graph theory, combinatorics, or algorithmic approaches to graph problems.

There are 3 main branches of algebraic graph theory involving
- linear algebra
- group theory
- the study of graph invariants
