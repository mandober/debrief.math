Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematicas that studies graphs. In graph theory, a graph is a network of vertices and edges connecting them. Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Graphs are used to represent and analyze a variety of systems and problems, including colorability problems, spanning trees, shortest path algorithms.

A **graph** is defined as a set of vertices and a set of edges, `G = (V, E)`.


Set theory focuses on math objects per se, exposing their internal structure, but it also makes a shift in this investigation by also exploring relations and functions between sets. Graph theory, as a step up from set theory, but still not as extreme a step as category theory, studies math objects in the abstract setting. It moves the attention from the math objects, deeming them unimportant and thus rendering them as structureless nodes, onto the the network of relations between them, which become the main subject mater.

Graph theory forgoes the direct probing of the structure of math objects in favor of a more abstract approach in which it derives information about them solely through an indirect examination of their relations, the process which the category theory favors and takes beyond any resonable level of abstraction. Still, even graph theory trats objects as structureless, featureless atoms, and represents them in a graph diagram as, possibly labelled, points. These are called *vertices* or nodes, and their role is demoted to things that only serve as anchors so that edges have a place to hang off of. The edges of a graph are of the primary interest as they represent relations between the objects (vertices). An edge is defined as an association between twe vertices.

Any relation between the objects in a graph is encoded in terms of edges that connect the vertices. We are left to infer any information of interest exclusively by examining these relations. Yet it is possible to derive a lot of information using only this method, that is, solely by following relations an object maintains with other objects. All interesting relations still manage to manifest through the edges that connect the objects.

When building a graph, we can attach arbitrary data with vertice and edges, although vertices usually only get labelled, but edges can get more attributes besides labels, like directionality, weight, payload, etc.; however, these are not essential properties since they are not intrinsic.
