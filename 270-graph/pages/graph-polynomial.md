# Graph polynomial

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_polynomial

A **graph polynomial** is a *graph invariant* whose values are polynomials. 
Invariants of this type are studied in *algebraic graph theory*.


Important graph polynomials include:

- *Characteristic polynomial*, based on the graph's adjacency matrix.

- *Chromatic polynomial*, a polynomial whose values at integer arguments give the number of colorings of the graph with that many colors.

- *Dichromatic polynomial*, a 2-variable generalization of the chromatic polynomial.

- *Flow polynomial*, a polynomial whose values at integer arguments give the number of nowhere-zero flows with integer flow amounts modulo the argument.

- *The (inverse of the) Ihara zeta function*, defined as a product of binomial terms corresponding to certain closed walks in a graph.

- *The Martin polynomial*, used by Pierre Martin to study Euler tours.

- *Matching polynomials*, several different polynomials defined as the generating function of the matchings of a graph.

- *Reliability polynomial*, a polynomial that describes the probability of remaining connected after independent edge failures.

- *The Tutte polynomial*, a polynomial in two variables that can be defined (after a small change of variables) as the generating function of the numbers of connected components of induced subgraphs of the given graph, parameterized by the number of vertices in the subgraph.
