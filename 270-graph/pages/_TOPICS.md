# Graph theory :: Graph :: Introduction

Introduction to graphs
- graph
- graph components
  - vertex
  - edge
- graph properties and attributes
- graph representation
  - edge list
  - adjacency list
    - adjacency list of edges
    - adjacency list of vertices
  - adjacency matrix
  - incidence matrix
  - dot product representation of a graph

- graph traversal
- vertex
  - endpoint (of an edge)
  - adjacency, adjacent nodes - endpoints of an edge
  - incidency, an edge incident to its endpoints
  - types of vertices
    - labeled vertex
- edge
  - types of edges
    - directed edge, arc, arrow
    - undirected edge, line
    - weigthed edge
    - unweigthed edge
- types of graphs
  - directed vs  undirected graph
  - weigthed vs unweigthed graph
  - multigraph vs simple graph
  - subgraph
  - hypergraph
