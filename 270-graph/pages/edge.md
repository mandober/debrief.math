# Edge

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(graph_theory)

An **edge** is a generic name for connections between vertices of a graph. An edge is said to be **incident** to its endpoints. Two edges are **adjacent** if they share an enpoint.

In an undirected graph, edges are called **lines**. A line is an unordered pair of vertices, `e = {v₁, v₂}`.

In a digraph, edges are called **arcs** or **arrows**, and they are ordered pairs of vertices, `e = (v₁, v₂)`; vertex `v₁` is the **source (origin, tail)** node of the edge (having an outgoing arrow), and node `v₂` is a **target (destination, head)** node of the edge (having an incoming arrow).
