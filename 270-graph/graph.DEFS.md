# Graphs :: Definitions and Terminology
(in order of appeareance)

## Graph theory
Traditionally, Graph Theory is a part of Discrete Mathematics concerned with the study of graphs. A Graph is a network of vertices, representing objects, and edges, representing relations between those objects. Graphs are used to represent various systems (computer network, social network) and to analyze problems (optimal route problem, shortest path, travelling salesman).

## Graph
A graph is a pair made of a set of vertices and a set of edges, `G = (V, E)`, with the invariant that `E ⊆ V²`.

## Vertex
Vertices represent abstract object, so being structureless, they are often drawn as circles or dots. They may also be labelled or associated with extra data.

## Edge
Edges represent relations between the objects (represented as vertices) as connections between them.

## Directionality
Graphs can be directed or undirected, with the former being more general. The property of directionality reflects in the edges.

## Undirected graph
Symmetric relations are represented by undirected egdes, comprising undirected graphs. An undirected edge is an unordered pair of vertices, `{v,u}`, a 2-set. An undirected edge is called a *link* or a *line*.

## Directed graph
Asymmetric relations are represented by directed egdes, comprising directed graphs. A directed edge is an ordered pair of vertices, `(v,u)`. A directed edge is called an *arc* or an *arrow*.

## Adjacency
Adjacency is a relation either between a pair of edges - two edges that share an enpoint are adjacent; or a pair of vertices - two connected vertices are adjacent.




## Incidence
Edge-vertex: an edge is *incident* to its endpoints.

## Distinctness
Distinct vertices imply distinct edges (not vice-versa)
