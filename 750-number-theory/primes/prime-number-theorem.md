# Prime number theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem

The **prime number theorem (PNT)** describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers among the positive integers. It formalizes the intuitive idea that primes become less common as they become larger by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.

$$
\displaystyle
\huge
  \lim _{x \to \infty }
  {\frac { \;\pi (x) \; }
  {\; \left [ {\frac {x} {\log(x)} } \right ] \;} } = 1
$$

Let `π(x)` be the prime-counting function defined to be the number of primes less than or equal to `x`, for any real number `x`.

For example, `π(10) = 4` because there are 4 prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7) less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that `x / log x` is a good approximation to `π(x)` (where log here means the natural logarithm), in the sense that the limit of the quotient of the two functions `π(x)` and `x / log x` as `x` increases without bound is 1:

`lim {x → ∞} ( π(x) / [x / log(x)] ) = 1`

known as the *asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers*.
