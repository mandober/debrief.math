https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_(linguistics)

In linguistics, more precisely in traditional grammar, a **multiplier** is a word that counts how many times its object should be multiplied, such as single or double.

They are contrasted with distributive numbers. In English, this part of speech is relatively marginal, and less recognized than cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers.
