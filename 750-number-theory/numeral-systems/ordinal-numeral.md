# Ordinal numeral

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_numeral

**Ordinal numerals** represent position in a sequence.

English has several versions (series) of ordinal numerals:
- a main series of commonly used adjectives: first, second, third, …
- a series of Latinate adjectives: primary, secondary, …
- a series of Greek prefixes: proto-, deutero-, …

The main series is formed regularly from lower cardinal numbers, starting with the single digits, by replacing the last word with the corresponding ordinal (e.g., "twenty-first", "hundred-twentieth"), or suffixing -th to a single word (e.g., tenth), or -eth for the multiples of ten ending in -y (e.g., twentieth). The Latinate series is formed from Latin numbers, but numbers above tertiary are very rare, and frequently confused with arities, which also end in -ary but are based on Latin distributive numbers, not ordinal numbers. The Greek series is quite technical, and obscure beyond deutero-, which is itself uncommon.
