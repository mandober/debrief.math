In number theory, Bertrand's postulate is a theorem stating that for any integer `n > 3`, there always exists at least one prime number `p` with 
`n < p < 2n - 2`.

A less restrictive formulation is: for every `n > 1`, there is always at least one prime `p` such that `n < p < 2n`.

Another formulation, where pₙ is the n-th prime, is for n ≥ 1, `pₙ﹢₁ + 1 < 2pₙ`.

This statement was first conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand (1822-1900). Bertrand himself verified his statement for all integers 2 ≤ n ≤ 3,000,000.

His conjecture was completely proved by Chebyshev 1852 and so the postulate is also called the *Bertrand-Chebyshev theorem* or *Chebyshev's theorem*.

Chebyshev's theorem can also be stated as a relationship with `π(x)`, the prime-counting function - number of primes less than or equal to `x`:    
`π(x) − π(x/2) ≥ 1`, for all x ≥ 2.
