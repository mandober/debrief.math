# Wilson's theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilsons_theorem

The Wilson's theorem states that a natural number `n > 1` is a prime number iff the product of all the positive integers less than `n` is one less than a multiple of `n`.

That is, the factorial `(n − 1)!` satisfies 

`(n − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod n)`

exactly when `n` is a prime number.

In other words, any number `n` is a prime number iff `(n − 1)! + 1` is divisible by `n`, i.e. `n | (n − 1)! + 1 --> n ∈ ℙ`.
