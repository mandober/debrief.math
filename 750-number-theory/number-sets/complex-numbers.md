# Complex numbers

The set of ℕ is the basis from which other number sets may be built by extension - by adding negative numbers to get ℤ, adding fractional numbers to get ℚ, adding irrational numbers to get ℝ, adding imaginary numbers to get ℂ.

The set of the **complex numbers**, `ℂ`, is the set of ℝ union the unresolved `√-1`, along with the sums and products thereof.
