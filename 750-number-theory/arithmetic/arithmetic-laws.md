* exponentiation is right-distributive over multiplication
(m * n) ↑ x = m ↑ x * n ↑ x

* exponentiation is not left-distributive over multiplication
x ↑ (m * n) = (x ↑ m) * (x ↑ n)

xⁿ = x * xⁿ⁻¹
xᵐ * xⁿ = xᵐᐩⁿ
(xᵐ)ⁿ = (xⁿ)ᵐ = xⁿᵐ

* exponentiation is not associative
(x ↑ m) ↑ n = (xᵐ)ⁿ
(x ↑ m) ↑ n ≠ x ↑ (m ↑ n)



* log: natural logarithm
exp (log x) = x = log (exp x)
√x = exp(1/2 log x)

exp x = lim (1 + x/n)ⁿ
        x->∞
