# Divisor Summatory Function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_summatory_function

In number theory, *the divisor summatory function* is a function that is a sum over the divisor function.

It frequently occurs in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the Riemann zeta function. The various studies of the behaviour of the divisor function are sometimes called divisor problems.

## Definition

The divisor summatory function is defined as

`D(x)` = `Σ {n <= x} d(n)` = `Σ {j,k,jk <= x} 1`

where

`d(n) = σ₀(n) = Σ {j,k,jk = x} 1`

is the divisor function.

*The divisor function* counts the number of ways that the integer `n` can be written as a product of two integers.
