# Arithmetic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic

The word arithmetic comes from the Greek `αριθμητική`, which is a compound of `ἀριθμός` (number) and `τέχνη, -τική` (art, skill, craft).

**Arithmetic** is a branch of math that studies numbers and operations that can be performed on numbers, especially the 4 traditional basic arithmetic operations.

Arithmetic uses concrete numbers (as opposed to variables that are used in algebra) because it is more concerned with immediate results of equations, and the exploration of ways to calculate the result more efficiently.

Besides the 4 basic operations, arithmetic also includes many other operations (exponentiation, roots, logarithms, percentages, etc.).

A mathematical object that supports all 4 basic arithmetic operations, with respect to a set of axioms, is called a *field*.
