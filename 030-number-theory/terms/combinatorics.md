# Combinatorics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics

Combinatorics primarily studies *counting*, both, for its own sake and as a tool in exploring certain properties of finite structures.

The scope of combinatorics traverses many subjects, so it might be better described by the problems it addresses:
- **enumeration** (counting) in connection with discrete structures, known as *arrangements* or *configurations*.
- existence of these structures that satisfy certain criteria.
- possibilities of constructing these structures.
- *optimization problem*: finding the best among possible candidates that satisfy some optimality criteria.

Combinatorics are used in algebra, probability theory, topology, geometry. In the late XX century, powerful theoretical methods were developed that helped promote combinatorics into the independent branch of math. Combinatorics is present in CS through graph theory, and it's often used in complexity theory.

In combinatorics, **the twelvefold way** is a systematic classification of 12 related enumerative problems concerning two finite sets, which include the classical problems of counting permutations, combinations, multisets, and partitions either of a set or of a number. The idea of the classification is credited to Gian-Carlo Rota, and the name was suggested by Joel Spencer.
