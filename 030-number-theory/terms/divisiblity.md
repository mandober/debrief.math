# Divisibility


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule

Divisibility := If `a` and `b` are ints, then `a` divides `b` if `b = a*n` for some int `n`. `a` is called a *factor* or *divisor* of `b`. `b` is called a *multiple* of `a`.

- shorthand `a divides b` is `a | b` i.e. `divisor | multiple`
- (ab e Z AND b=a*n) . a | b
- int `p` is even exactly when `2 | p`
- zero being even is a special case cuz zero is divisible by any int


7  | 77 = T
77 | 7  = F
7  | 7  = T  any integer is divisible by itself
7  | 1  = T  any integer is divisible by one
7  | 0  = T  zero is divisible by any integer
0  | 7  = F  cuz 0*7=0; *zero is a FACTOR of zero alone* 
-3 | 12 = T
3  |-12 = T
