# Proof Theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory

Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques.

Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as lists or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and [rules of inference](./rule-of-inference.md) of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to [model theory](), which is semantic in nature.

Some of the major areas of proof theory include:
- structural proof theory
- ordinal analysis
- provability logic
- reverse mathematics
- proof mining
- automated theorem proving
- proof complexity

Much research also focuses on applications in computer science, linguistics, and philosophy.
