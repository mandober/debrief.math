# Logical connective

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective

A **logical connective** is a symbol used to connect two or more statements of a formal language in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced, depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective.

Strictly speaking, a logical connective may be just a connective that links (parts of) statements without affecting their truth value. A logical connective may be called a *logical operator* only in some cases:

> When a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected by logical connectives, if the truth value of the compound statement is entirely determined by the truth values of the constituent statements, the compound statement is called a truth function, and any *logical connectives* used are said to be *truth functional*.


The most common logical connectives are binary connectives which join two sentences which can be thought of as the function's operands.

Also commonly, negation is considered to be a unary connective.

Logical connectives along with quantifiers are the two main types of *logical constants* used in formal systems such as propositional logic and predicate logic.

Semantics of a logical connective is often, but not always, presented as a truth function.

A logical connective is similar to but not equivalent to a *conditional operator*.
