# Logic: Glossary


## Logical connectives
(⇒, ∧, ∨, and ⇐⇒ ), negation (¬), and parentheses. These will be used to
recursively build complex formulas, just as was done for propositional logic.

## Constants symbols
are strings that will be interpreted as representing objects, e.g. Bob might
be a constant.

## Variable symbols
will be used as “place holders” for quantifying over objects.

## Predicate symbols

Predicates are represented by a predicate symbol, which is usually a single letter, often pulled from the Greek or Latin alphabet. Predicates are used to denote properties of objects and relationships among them. Each predicate has an associated arity.

Unary predicates represent positive or nagative properties of objects. For example, φ(x) could stand to mean that an object x is an odd number; i.e. x has a property of being odd.

Polyadic predicates represent relations between objects. For example, if F stands for a function, we can denote it by F(x,y).
