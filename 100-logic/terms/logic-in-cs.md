Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of CS. The topic can essentially be divided into 3 main areas:
* Theoretical foundations and analysis
* Use of computer technology to aid logicians
* Use of concepts from logic for computer applications


*Logic in CS*, or *computational logic*, is a field on the intersection between mathematical logic and computer science containing:
- investigations into logic that are guided by applications in CS:
  - Rewriting systems
  - Combinatory logic
  - Abstract interpretation
- Fundamental concepts in CS that are naturally expressible in logical form:
  - Type theory
  - Formal semantics of programming languages
  - Hoare logic
  - Logic programming
- Applications of fundamental concepts derived from the theory of computation:
  - Curry-Howard correspondence
  - Game semantics
- Tools for logicians considered as applied CS:
  - Automated theorem proving
  - Model checking
