# Categorical proposition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_proposition

In logic, a **categorical proposition**, or **categorical statement**, is a proposition that asserts or denies that all or some of the members of one category (the subject term) are included in another (the predicate term).

> A syllogism is a categorical statement.

The study of arguments using categorical statements (i.e. syllogisms) forms an important branch of deductive reasoning that began with the Ancient Greeks.


Aristotle identified 4 primary distinct types of categorical proposition and gave them standard forms, called A, E, I, O. If the subject category is `S` and the predicate category is `P` they are:

syllogistic logic:    |  propositional logic:
- A: All  S are     P |  ∀x. S(x) -> P(x) or ¬∃x. S(x) ∧ ¬P(x)
- E: All  S are not P |  ∀x. S(x) ->¬P(x) or ¬∃x. S(x) ∧  P(x)
- I: Some S are     P |  ∃x. S(x) ∧  P(x)
- O: Some S are not P |  ∃x. S(x) ∧ ¬P(x)


A large number of sentences may be translated into one of these canonical forms while retaining all or most of the original meaning of the sentence.

Aristotle's investigations resulted in the so-called *square of opposition*, which codifies the logical relations among the different forms (e.g. that an A-statement is contradictory to an O-statement).

Thus the relationships of the square of opposition may allow *immediate inference*, whereby the truth or falsity of one of the forms may follow directly from the truth or falsity of a statement in another form.

Modern understanding of categorical propositions requires one to consider *if the subject category may be empty*.

If so, this is called the **hypothetical viewpoint**, in opposition to the **existential viewpoint** which requires the subject category to have at least one member.

The existential viewpoint is a stronger stance than the hypothetical and, when it is appropriate to take, it allows one to deduce more results than otherwise could be made.

The hypothetical viewpoint, being the weaker view, has the effect of removing some of the relations present in the traditional square of opposition.

Arguments consisting of 3 categorical propositions, 2 premises and a conclusion, are called **categorical syllogisms**.

Although formal arguments using categorical syllogisms have largely given way to the increased expressive power of modern logic systems, they still retain practical value in addition to their historic and pedagogical significance.
