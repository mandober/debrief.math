## Properties of functions

A function is a special set.   
A function is a special type of relation.   
A type is a set.   
A function is a mapping between two sets (types).   
A relation is a set of ordered pairs (a,b).   

A function is defined in terms of sets:   
a function between two sets A and B   
(or a function on a set A, in case A = B),   
is a special type of relation between A and B;

Any binary relation between two sets `A` and `B` is a set, `𝓡 = { (a,b) | a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B }`, of ordered pairs, `(a,b)` such that the first component, `a`, is from the domain and the second, `b`, is from the codomain.

`a𝓡b` is the notation meaning that `a` is 𝓡-related to `b`; another notation, `(a,b) ∈ 𝓡`, means the same.
