# Euclidean vector

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector

In mathematics and physics, a **vector** (*Euclidean vector*, *geometric vector*, *spatial vector*) is a geometric object that has magnitude (length) and direction.

A Euclidean vector is frequently represented by a *ray* (a directed line segment), or graphically, as an arrow connecting an initial point `A` with a terminal point `B`, denoted by $\overrightarrow {AB}$.

Vectors can be added to other vectors according to *vector algebra*.

A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point `A` to the point `B`. The Latin word *vector* means "carrier". The term "vector" was first used by 18th century astronomers investigating planetary revolution around the Sun.

The *magnitude of the vector* is the distance between the two points. The *direction of the vector* refers to the direction of displacement from `A` to `B`.

Many algebraic operations on real numbers (addition, multiplication, negation, subtraction) have close analogues for vectors. These operations obey familiar algebraic laws of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity. The set of operations and associated laws qualify Euclidean vectors as an example of the more generalized concept of vectors, which are defined simply as elements of a *vector space*.

Vectors play an important role in physics: the velocity and acceleration of a moving object, and the forces acting on it, can all be described with vectors. Many other physical quantities can be usefully thought of as vectors. Although most of them don't represent distances (except, e.g. position or displacement), their magnitude and direction can still be represented by the length and direction of an arrow.

The mathematical representation of a physical vector depends on the coordinate system used to describe it.

Other vector-like objects that describe physical quantities, that are transformed in a similar way with the change of the underlying coordinate system, include *pseudovectors* and *tensors*.
