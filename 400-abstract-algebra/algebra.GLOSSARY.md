## Total order
A total order (linear order) is a *partial order* in which any two elements are comparable. A total order is a binary relation `â‰¤` on a set which is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and total (strongly connected). Total orders are also called simple, connex, full orders. A set equipped with a total order is a *totally ordered set* (simply ordered set, linearly ordered set, loset). *Chain* is sometimes used as a synonym of totally ordered set, but chain generally refers to some sort of totally ordered subsets of a given partially ordered set. An extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a *linear extension* of that partial order.
