# Semigroup

## Semigroupoid
Semigroupoid (semicategory, naked category, precategory) is a partial algebra that satisfies the axioms for a small category, except possibly for the requirement that there be an identity at each object.

Semigroupoids generalize semigroups in the same way that small categories generalise monoids and groupoids generalize groups.
