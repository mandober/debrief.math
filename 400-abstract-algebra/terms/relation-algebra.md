# Relation algebra

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_algebra

In mathematics and abstract algebra, a **relation algebra** is a *residuated Boolean algebra* expanded with an involution called *converse* (unary operation).

The motivating example of a relation algebra is the algebra `2‚ÜëX¬≤` of all binary relations on a set `X`, that is, subsets of the cartesian square `X¬≤`, with `R ‚Ä¢ S` interpreted as the usual composition of binary relations `R` and `S`, and with the converse of `R` as the converse relation.

* Relation algebra emerged in the 19th-century work of Augustus De Morgan and Charles Peirce, which culminated in the algebraic logic of Ernst Schr√∂der.
* The equational form of relation algebra was developed by Alfred Tarski and his students, starting in the 1940s.
* Tarski and Givant (1987) applied relation algebra to a variable-free treatment of axiomatic set theory, with the implication that mathematics founded on set theory could itself be conducted without variables.

A relation algebra (ùôá, ‚àß, ‚à®, ‚Åª, 0, 1, ‚Ä¢, Àò, ùë∞) is an *algebraic structure* equipped with the Boolean operations of
- conjunction `x ‚àß y`
- disjunction `x ‚à® y`
- negation `x‚Åª`
- Boolean constant `0`
- Boolean constant `1`
- relational operation of composition `x ‚Ä¢ y`
- relational operation of converse `xÀò`
- relational constant `I`

such that these operations and constants satisfy certain equations constituting an axiomatization of a *calculus of relations*.

Roughly, a relation algebra is 
to a *system of binary relations* on a set 
containing the empty (0), complete (1), and identity (I) relations 
and closed under these 5 operations 
as a group is 
to a system of permutations 
of a set containing the identity permutation and 
closed under composition and inverse. 

However, the first order theory of relation algebras is not complete for such systems of binary relations.
