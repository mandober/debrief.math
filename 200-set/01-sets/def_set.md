# Definition

Actually a description. The notion of a sets is too elusive to be captured in a definition, so sets are championed by an Ã©minence grise who immediately plays the "The power of intuition compels you! The power of intuition compels you! The power of intuition compels you!" card, threatening to flip any objection against the objector and his poor intuition.



A set is either a collection of elements or nothing at all; just an arbitrary demarcation in Maybe spacetime that cannot be identified. So you never know if it's there or you've been pointing at the void filled with emptiness while rambling about the empty set. oh fish, oh fish, oh fish. 'twas such an elusive fish.

But where have all the elements gone? Well, nowhere; they're still there if you decide so.
