# Well-ordering theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-ordering_theorem

*The well-ordering theorem*, also known as *Zermelo's theorem*, states that every set can be well-ordered.

A set `X` is well-ordered by a strict total order if every non-empty subset of `X` has a least element under the ordering.

The well-ordering theorem together with *Zorn's lemma* are the most important mathematical statements that are equivalent to the axiom of choice.

Ernst Zermelo introduced the axiom of choice as an "unobjectionable logical principle" to prove the well-ordering theorem.

One can conclude from the well-ordering theorem that every set is susceptible to *transfinite induction*, which is considered by mathematicians to be a powerful technique. One famous consequence of the theorem is the Banach-Tarski paradox.

For any set `X`, there is a binary relation `R` which well-orders `X`. This means `R` is a linear order on `X` such that every nonempty subset of `X` has a member which is minimal under `R`.
