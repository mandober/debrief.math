# Naive Set Theory by Paul Halmos

About a book and interpretation of set theory:   
`"Naïve Set Theory"` by Paul R. Halmos, 1960

Here, the term "naïve set theory" refers to the informal presentation of an otherwise axiomatic set theory, where the words such as `and`, `or`, `if...then`, `not`, `for some`, `for every` are treated as in ordinary natural language.

Axioms of Paul Halmos' set theory
1. Axiom of extension
2. Axiom of unions
3. Axiom of specification
4. Axiom of pairing
5. Axiom of powers
6. Axiom of infinity
7. Axiom of substitution
8. Axiom of choice


Axioms:

1. Axiom of extension

two sets are equal iff they have the same elements

2. Axiom of unions

for every collection of sets there exists a set that contains all the elements that belong to at least one set of the given collection.

3. Axiom of specification

To every set A and to every condition S(x) there corresponds a set B whose elements are exactly those elements x of A for which S(x) holds.

4. Axiom of pairing

For any two sets there exists a set that they both belong to.

5. Axiom of powers

For each set there exists a collection of sets that contains among its elements all the subsets of the given set.

6. Axiom of infinity

There exists a set containing 0 and the successor of each of its elements.

7. Axiom of substitution

If S(a,b) is a sentence such that for each a in set A the set {b: S(a,b)} can be formed, then there exists a function F with domain A such that F(a) = {b:S(a,b)} for each a in A (Anything intelligent that one can do to the elements of a set yields a set).

8. Axiom of choice

The Cartesian product of a non-empty family of non-empty sets is non-empty
