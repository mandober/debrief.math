# Axioms of Set Theory

- Axiom of Extension: 
  two sets are equal iff they contain the same elements.
- Axiom of Regularity: 
- Axiom Schema of Specification: 
- Axiom of Pairing: 
  for any two sets, there exists a set to which only those two sets belong.
- Axiom of Union:  
  for every collection of sets, there exists a set that contains all the elements that belong to at least one of the sets in the collection.
- Axiom of Replacement: 
  for any set $$S$$, there exists a set $$x$$ such that, for any element $$y$$ of $$S$$, if there exists an element $$z$$ satisfying the condition $$P(y,z)$$, where $$P(y,z)$$ is a propositional function, then such $$z$$ appear in $$x$$.
- Axiom of the Empty Set: 
  there exists a set that has no elements.
- Axiom of Subsets: 
  for every set and every condition, there corresponds a set whose elements are exactly the same as those elements of the original set for which the condition is true.
- Axiom of Powerset: 
  for each set there exists a collection of sets that contains amongst its elements all the subsets of the given set.
- Axiom of Infinity: 
  there exists a set containing a set with no elements and the successor of each of its elements.
- Axiom of Foundation: 
  for all non-null sets, there is an element of the set that shares no member with the set.
- Axiom of Choice: 
  for every set, we can provide a mechanism for choosing one element of any non-empty subset of the set.
