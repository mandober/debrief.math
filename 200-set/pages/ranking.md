# Ranking

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking

A **ranking** is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either ranked "higher than", "lower than" or "equal to" the second item.

This is known as a *weak order* or *total preorder* of objects.

  A.N. A *trichotomous relation* is a relation in which all elements of a set are comparable, and, for any two elements `x` and `y`, it holds that either `xRy`, `yRx` or `x = y`. Trichotomy is a property of totally ordered sets (any element is comparable to any other element). More generally, a binary relation R on a set X is trichotomous if for all x and y in X, exactly one of xRy, yRx and x = y holds. The *law of trichotomy* states that every real number is either positive, negative, or zero.



It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. The rankings themselves are totally ordered. For example, materials are totally preordered by hardness, while degrees of hardness are totally ordered. If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie.

By reducing detailed measures to a sequence of ordinal numbers, rankings make it possible to evaluate complex information according to certain criteria. Thus, for example, an Internet search engine may rank the pages it finds according to an estimation of their relevance, making it possible for the user quickly to select the pages they are likely to want to see.

Analysis of data obtained by ranking commonly requires non-parametric statistics.
