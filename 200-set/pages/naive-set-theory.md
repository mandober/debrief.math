# Naïve set theory

Naïve set theory is a collective name for any non-axiomatic approach to the theory of sets that allows the unrestricted use of The Axiom Of Comprehension.

The Axiom of Comprehension is the central principle of naive set theories. It allows defining a set in terms of a predicate that potential set elements must satisfy. The set-builder form is the notation of choice for specifying a set based on a predicate, according to the template `{ x | Px }`.

For example, `{ x | ∀x(x ∈ ℕ --> x ≡ 0 𝚖𝚘𝚍 𝟸) }`

```
{ x | ∀x(x ∈ ℕ --> x ≡ 0 (mod 2)) }

{ x | x + iy | x,y ∈ ℤ } where i² = √-1
```
