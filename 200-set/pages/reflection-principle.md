# Reflection principle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_principle

In set theory, the *reflection principle* says that it is possible to find sets that resemble *the class of all sets*.

The name "reflection principle" comes from the fact that properties of the universe of all sets are "reflected" down to a smaller set.

There are several different forms of the reflection principle 
(depending on exactly what is meant by "resemble"): 
* *Weak forms* are theorems of ZF due to Montague, 1961.
* *Stronger forms* can be new and very powerful axioms for set theory.
