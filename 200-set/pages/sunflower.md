# Sunflower

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_(mathematics)

In the mathematical fields of set theory and extremal combinatorics, a sunflower or *Δ-system* is a collection of sets whose pairwise intersection is constant. This constant intersection is called the kernel of the sunflower.

The main research question arising in relation to sunflowers is: under what conditions does there exist a large sunflower (a sunflower with many sets) in a given collection of sets?

The Δ-lemma, sunflower lemma, and the *Erdős-Rado sunflower conjecture* give successively weaker conditions which would imply the existence of a large sunflower in a given collection, with the latter being one of the most famous open problems of extremal combinatorics.
