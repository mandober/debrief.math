# Set theory :: Types of sets :: Subclass

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclass_(set_theory)

A subclass is a class contained in another class, analogously to a subset being contained in another set.

Given classes A and B, A is a subclass of B iff every member of A is also a member of B. If A and B are sets, then, of course, A is also a subset of B.

In fact, when using a definition of classes that requires them to be first-order definable, it is sufficient that B is a set; the axiom of specification essentially says that A must then also be a set.

As with subsets, the empty set is a subclass of every class, and any class is a subclass of itself.

>Additionally, however, every class is a subclass of the class of all sets.

Accordingly, the *subclass relation* makes the collection of all classes into a *Boolean lattice*, which is not the case with the *subset relation* acting on the collection of all sets. Instead, the collection of all sets is an *ideal* in the collection of all classes (Of course, the collection of all classes is something larger than even a class!).
