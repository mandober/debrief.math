In order theory, a **weak ordering** is a mathematical formalization of the intuitive notion of a *ranking of a set*, some of whose members may be tied (have equal rank) with each other.

Weak orders are a generalization of *totally ordered sets* (rankings without ties) and are in turn generalized by *(strictly) partially ordered sets* and *preorders*.
