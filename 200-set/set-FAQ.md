## Selecting distinct set elements

To construct a disjoint union of two sets A and B, we need to tag each element in set A with a tag pulled from the indexing set I = {0,1}, e.g. with 0, and each element in set B with the other index, i.e. with 1. In general, how do we select elements from the indexing set such that each selection is a different element from all the previous selections (without testing for equality)?


* How do we make sure to use 0 for elements of A, and 1 for elements of B?
* How to pick the element `0` from set `{0,1}`, and than pick the element `1` (and not again `0`)?
* In general, how do we select an element from a set, and then select another element different from the previous selection(s)?

* In brief, how do we operationally construct a disjoint union?

### Example

- Union, A‚ÇÄ ‚à™ A‚ÇÅ = {1,2,3}
- N-ary union, `‚ãÉ{i‚ààI}A·µ¢`, I = {0,1}
- Disjoint union: X ‚äé Y = { (1,f), (2,f), (2,t), (3,t) }
- N-ary disjoint union `‚®Ñ{i‚ààI}A·µ¢`, I = {0,1}
- ‚à™ ‚äé ‚©Å ‚©Ö ‚ãì ‚©Ç ‚ãÉ ‚®Ñ ‚®É ‚®Ü ‚©è

```
I = {0,1}
A‚ÇÄ = {1,2} = X
A‚ÇÅ = {2,3} = Y
A = {A‚ÇÄ, A‚ÇÅ} = {{1,2}, {2,3}}
A‚ÇÄ ‚à™ A‚ÇÅ = {1,2} ‚à™ {2,3} = {1,2,2,3} = {1,2,3}


(X‚®ØI) = {1, 2} ‚®Ø {f, t} = { (1,f), (1,t), (2,f), (2,t) }
(Y‚®ØI) = {2, 3} ‚®Ø {f, t} = { (2,f), (2,t), (3,f), (3,t) }
----
(X‚®ØI) ‚ãÉ (Y‚®ØI) = { (1,f), (1,t), (2,f), (2,t), (2,f), (2,t), (3,f), (3,t) }





(X ‚®Ø ùîπ) ‚ãÉ (Y ‚®Ø ùîπ)
  = ({1,2} ‚®Ø {f,t}) ‚ãÉ ({2,3} ‚®Ø {f,t})
  = { (1,f), (1,t), (2,f), (2,t) } ‚ãÉ { (2,f), (2,t), (3,f), (3,t) }
  = { (1,f), (1,t), (2,f), (2,t)   ,   (2,f), (2,t), (3,f), (3,t) }


X ‚®Ø ùîπ = {1,2} ‚®Ø {f} = { (1,f), (2,f) }
Y ‚®Ø ùîπ = {2,3} ‚®Ø {t} = { (2,t), (3,t) }

how to select each element distinctly?
cast to list? then run through some counter?
what's the math notation?
seems this is not possible...

### GPT answer (bing)

To construct a disjoint union of two sets A and B, we need to tag each element in set A with a tag pulled from the indexing set I = {0,1}, e.g. with 0, and each element in set B with the other index, i.e. with 1 ¬π. 

To select elements from the indexing set such that each selection is a different element from all the previous selections (without testing for equality), we can use the **Cantor pairing function** ¬≤. The Cantor pairing function is defined as follows:

`œÄ(i,j) = ((i+j) * (i+j+1) * 0.5) + j`

where `i` and `j` are non-negative integers. The function maps a pair of non-negative integers to a unique natural number. We can use this function to map each pair `(a, b)` to a unique natural number `n` and then use the binary representation of `n` to select elements from the indexing set `I`.

For example, suppose we want to construct the disjoint union of two sets A and B, where A has 3 elements and B has 2 elements. We can use the Cantor pairing function to map each pair `(a, b)` to a unique natural number `n` as follows:

```
(0,0) ‚üº 0
(0,1) ‚üº 1
(1,0) ‚üº 2
(2,0) ‚üº 3
(1,1) ‚üº 4
(2,1) ‚üº 5
```

We can then use the binary representation of `n` to select elements from the indexing set `I` as follows:

```
dec bin elem
0 =   0 ‚üº 0
1 =   1 ‚üº 1
2 =  10 ‚üº 0
3 =  11 ‚üº 1
4 = 100 ‚üº 0
5 = 101 ‚üº 1
```

Therefore, we can tag each element in set A with 0 or 1 depending on whether its corresponding binary digit is 0 or 1, respectively. Similarly, we can tag each element in set B with 0 or 1 depending on whether its corresponding binary digit is the opposite of that for its corresponding element in set A.

I hope this helps!
