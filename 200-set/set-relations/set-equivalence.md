# Set equivalence

Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements.

Two sets are *equivalent* if and only if there is a bijection between them.

A bijection (one to one correspondence) is different from an isomorphism:
- a bijection between two sets is a single function, `f : A -> B`, that is invertable (it has an inverse, and inverse is a function)
- an isomorphism between two sets `A` and `B` is defined by a pair of functions, `from : A -> B` and `to : B -> A`. It is a weaker notion of equality: it usully occurs in phrases such as "the two sets are equal up to an isomorphism", with a slightly stronger notion of equality is there is a unique isomorphism, e.g. "the two sets are equal up to a unique isomorphism".

In general, isomorphisms allow us to compare two objects (for equality) by comparing only a subsets and not the entire set of their properties. For example, it may be desirable to compare two books for equality by comparing just their ISBN, disregarding the other attributes.
