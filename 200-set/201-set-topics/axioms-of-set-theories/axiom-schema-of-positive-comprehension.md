# Axiom schema of positive comprehension

`∃x ∀y(y ∈ x ⇔ ϕ(y))`

## Axiom of positive comprehension

`∃X ∀x(x ∈ X ⇔ ϕ(x))`

where `ϕ` is a positive formula. A *positive formula* uses only the logical constants `{⊤,⊥, ∧,∨, ∀,∃, =,∈}` but not `{→,¬}`.

The axiom of positive comprehension is found in Positive Set Theory.


`X = { x | ϕ(x) }`
