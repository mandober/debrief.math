# Set Theory :: ZFC Axioms :: Axiom of Choice

For every family `𝓕` of non-empty sets, there is a function `f`, called a *choice function*, which selects one element from each member of `𝓕`, i.e. `∀x ∈ 𝓕. f(x) ∈ x`.

Equivalently, every Cartesian product of non-empty sets is non-empty.

AC is independent of the other axioms of ZFC Set Theory.

- *Full AC*: every family of non-empty sets has a choice function.
- *Weaker AC*: every family of non-empty *finite* sets has a choice function.
