# Georg Cantor

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor

Georg Cantor (1845-1918) was a German mathematician who invented set theory, and contributed to matematics with this and his other works.

Cantor has invented set theory and uncovered many other important findings in his work. Cantor has established the importance of bijection (one-to-one correspondence) when comparing the sizes of sets. He has introduced *infinite sets* and *well-ordering*, and proved that the set of the real numbers ℝ is larger than the set of the natural numbers ℕ, which implied not only that there are multiple infinities, but that some are larger than others (infinity's mothers). In fact, Cantor's proof of this theorem implies the existence of *infinity of infinities*. Cantor has also introduced *cardinal numbers* and *ordinal numbers* and defined arithmetical operations on them.

Cantor spent his entire career at the University of Halle. In `1879`, at 34 years of age, Cantor became the full professor there. Attaining this position at his age was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a chair at the university of Berlin, the leading German university at the time. Unfortunately, his work on set theory encountered too much opposition to make that possible.

Cantor's former professor, Leopold Kronecker, was the head of mathematics at Berlin's university and a well-established figure in the math community, and he despised Cantor's work, even publically attacking Cantor, caling him a "corrupter of youth" and "scientific charlatan". Even worse, in `1874`, Kronecker intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor's first major publication.

Kronecker, who was one of the founders of the constructive mathematics, disliked Cantor's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without providing examples of such sets.

Cantor's work between `1874` and `1884` is the origin of set theory.

Georg Cantor has put set theory on a proper mathematical basis. Cantor's early work was in number theory and he published a number of articles on this topic between 1867 and 1871. These, although of high quality, give no indication that they were written by a man about to change the whole course of mathematics.
