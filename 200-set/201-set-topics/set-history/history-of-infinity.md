## Zeno of Elea

**Zeno of Elea** was a Greek philosopher famous for posing so-called paradoxes which challenged mathematicians' view of the real world for many centuries.

Ancient Greeks were already pondering the nature of infinity, with Zeno of Elea making an early contribution around 450 BC with his paradoxical views about movement and infinity.

The main source of our knowledge of Zeno comes from the dialogue "Parmenides" by Plato. Proclus had also described Zeno's work and confirmed that: "Zeno has elaborated different paradoxes following from the assumption of plurality and motion, all of them apparently based on the difficulties deriving from an analysis of the continuum".

The paradoxes that Zeno gave regarding motion are more perplexing. Aristotle, in his work "Physics", gives 4 of Zeno's arguments: The Dichotomy, The Achilles, The Arrow, and The Stadium.

In *"The Dichotomy"* Zeno claims: "There is no motion because that which is moved must arrive at the middle of its course before it arrives at the end". In order the traverse a line segment, it is necessary to reach its midpoint, 1/2; but to do this, one must reach the 1/4 point; but to do this, one must reach the 1/8 point; and so on, ad infinitum. Hence, motion cannot even begin (i.e. movement is an illusion). 

This can be expressed as the series `1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + …` which is infinite and thus never actually equal to 1. What is more perplexing to the human mind is the attempt to sum the series backwards: before traversing a unit distance we must get to the middle, but even before that we must get 1/4 of the way, but before that we must get 1/8 of the way, etc. This argument implies we can never even start to move since we are trying to build up this infinite sum from the "wrong" end. This clever argument still puzzles people today.

Zeno bases both the dichotomy paradox and the attack on pluralism on the fact that if a thing can be divided, then it can be divided infinitely often. Zeno also claims that a thing which has no magnitude cannot exist. One could counter his paradoxes by postulating an atomic theory in which matter is composed of many small indivisible elements. However, other paradoxes given by Zeno cause problems precisely because in these cases he considers that seemingly continuous magnitudes are made up of indivisible elements.

Such a paradox is *"The Arrow"* as described by Aristotle: "If everything is either at rest or moving when it occupies a space equal to itself, while the object moved is in the instant, the moving arrow is unmoved". The argument rests on the fact that if, in an indivisible instant of time, the arrow moved, then indeed this instant of time would be divisible (for example, in a smaller "instant" of time, the arrow would have moved half the distance). Aristotle argues against the paradox by claiming: "…for time is not composed of indivisible 'nows', no more than is any other magnitude". However, this is considered by some to be irrelevant to Zeno's argument. Moreover to deny that "now" exists as an instant which divides the past from the future, seems counterintuitive. However, if the instant "now" doesn't exist, then the arrow never occupies any particular position, and this doesn't seem right either. Again Zeno has presented a deep problem which, despite centuries of efforts to resolve it, still seems to lack a truly satisfactory solution.

Russell certainly did not underrate Zeno's significance, writing: "Although they have often been dismissed as logical nonsense, many attempts have also been made to dispose of them by means of mathematical theorems, such as the theory of convergent series or the theory of sets. In the end, however, the difficulties inherent in his arguments have always come back with a vengeance, for the human mind is so constructed that it can look at a continuum in two ways that are not quite reconcilable".

Frankel wrote about these two ways saying: "The human mind, when trying to give itself an accurate account of motion, finds itself confronted with two aspects of the phenomenon. Both are inevitable but at the same time they are mutually exclusive. Either we look at the continuous flow of motion; then it will be impossible for us to think of the object in any particular position. Or we think of the object as occupying any of the positions through which its course is leading it; and while fixing our thought on that particular position we cannot help fixing the object itself and putting it at rest for one short instant".

## Albert of Saxony

In c.1356, *Albert of Saxony* (c. 1320-1390) in "Questiones subtilissime in libros de celo et mundi" proves that a (wooden) beam of infinite length has the same volume as 3D space. He proves this by sawing the beam into imaginary pieces, which he then reassembles into successive concentric shells, which tend to fill the entire space.

## Bernard Bolzano

Bernard Bolzano (1781 - 1848) was a philosopher and mathematician who considered the concept of sets: "an embodiment of the idea or concept which we conceive when we regard the arrangement of its parts as a matter of indifference".

Bolzano defended the concept of *infinite set* at a time when many believed that infinite sets could not exist. Bolzano's work "Paradoxien des Unendlichen", published in 1851, (three years after his death by one of his students) was a study of paradoxes of the infinite. The word "set" appears here for the first time ever. In this work, Bolzano gave examples to show that, unlike for finite sets, the elements of an infinite set could be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of its proper subset. This idea eventually came to be used in the definition of a *finite set*.

Most of Bolzano's works remained in manuscript and thus did not become noticed and did not influence the development of relavant theories. Many of his works were not published until 1862 or later. Bolzano's theories of mathematical infinity anticipated Georg Cantor's theory of infinite sets. It is also remarkable that Bolzano gave an example of a function which is nowhere differentiable yet everywhere continuous.

As an example of the mathematics that Bolzano was working on while he was professor of the philosophy of religion, here is a description of what he recorded in his notebook "Miscellanea Mathematica" in 1816. The description is by Dauben reviewing this material when it was first published in 1996: "Bolzano opens this notebook of 'Miscellanea Mathematica' with notes on irrational and transcendental numbers and functions. But he was reading and recording his ideas on a host of other subjects as well, including the problem of how best to approach the proper mathematical understanding of zero; Legendre's work on surfaces, convexity, concavity, and conditions for congruity; analysis of other geometric concepts, including lengths, areas, volumes, and spheres; trigonometric formulas and spherical trigonometry; imaginary and exponential numbers; definition of the differential and discussion of the infinite and various opinions about it, as well as aspects of maxima and minima. Other topics covered here include various approaches to the calculus (including the method of exhaustion), and grounds for asserting the certainty of mathematics".

## Richard Dedekind


In 1872, Cantor met *Richard Dedekind* and the two started correspondence. Numerous letters exchanged between them from 1873-1879 were preserved, which show that Dedekind's deeply abstract way of thinking was a major influence on Cantor.
