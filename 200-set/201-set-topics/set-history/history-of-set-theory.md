# History of set theory

Most mathematical theories start with a rudimentary idea that takes a considerable effort across a number of years to mold into a concept suitable to formalization.

Not so with the set theory, which was founded by a single man - the German mathematician **Georg Cantor** (1845-1918) who introduced it in his paper "On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers" in 1874. Cantor's work alone, between 1874 and 1884, is the origin of set theory.

Cantor spent his entire career at the University of Halle, but he wanted a position at the university of Berlin, the leading German university at the time, with Cantor's former professor, **Leopold Kronecker**, as the head of the prestigous department of mathematics.

The idea of sets introduced by Cantor was so revolutionary for that time that he quickly garnered strong opposition from many sides, particularly vehement from his former professor. Kronecker despised sets so intenesly he stooped to name calling their creator, coloring Cantor as "the corrupter of youth" and "scientific charlatan". Even worse, Kronecker used his influence to delay the publication of Cantor's first major work in 1874. One of the reasons for his extreme behaviour was that Kronecker, being a constructivists, dispised Cantor's assertions about the existence of sets for which he didn't provide a witnessing instance. However, the biggest thorn in Kronecker's constructivist posterior were Cantor's ideas about infinities, which was somewhat of a taboo at the time, even in the singular noun form.

Cantor had not only touched, but successfully (time will tell) expanded the concept of infinity, asserting the existence of ever growing sequence of larger and larger infinities. He also proved that some smaller infinities were countable, but that many others were in fact uncountable (some infinities' mothers are bigger then other infinities' mothers).

Cantor has also emphasized the use of bijective functions (one-to-one correspondences) as the appropriate tool for comparing infinite sets. Cantor has also defined infinite and well-ordered sets, and using his newly devised method of diagonalization, he showed that the set of the real numbers is larger then the set of the natural numbers, despite both sets being infinite. This revelation implied that not all infinities were equinumerous, but the existence of infinity of infinities as well. Cantor had also defined cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic based on the transfinite induction.
