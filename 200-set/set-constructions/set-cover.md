# Set cover

A family of sets is said to **cover** the set `X` if every point of `X` belongs to some member of the family.

A subfamily of a cover that continues to cover `X` is called a *subcover*.

A family is called a *point-finite collection* if every point of `X` lies in only finitely many family members. If every point lies in exactly one member then the cover is called a *partition*.

When `X` is a topological space, then a cover whose members are all *open sets* is called and **open cover**.

A family is called **locally finite** if each point in the space has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many family members.

A **Ïƒ-locally finite** or **countably locally finite** collection is any family that is equal to a union of countably many locally finite families.

One cover `F` is said to **refine** another (coarser) cover `C` if every member of `F` is contained in some member of `C`. A **star refinement** is a particular type of *refinement*.
