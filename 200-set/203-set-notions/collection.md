# Collection

A collection should not come with any baggage, and should just denote a collection of objects without pressuposing any properties of said collection. Broadly, a collection may be indeed any collection of objects like set, list, multiset, but narrowly, in the context of set theory it is often used as a common denominator for sets, classes, and perhaps conglomerates.
