# Axiom of adjunction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_adjunction

The **Axiom of Adjunction** states that for any sets `x` and `y`, 
there is a set `A`, the adjunction of `x` and `y`, 
given by "adjoining" `y` to `x`, `A = x ⋃ {y}`, 
so it contains set `y` and all elements of `x`.

`∀x ∀y ∃A (∀z(z ∈ A ⇔ z ∈ x ⋁ z = y))`

Note: here adjunction refers to an operation on two sets, and has no bearing on the use of that term in category theory and elsewhere.


In 1929, Bernays introduced the Axiom of Adjunction as one of the axioms for a system of set theory.

The Axiom of Adjunction is a *weak axiom*, used in some weak systems of set theory, such as General Set Theory or Finitary Set Theory.


The adjunction operation is also used as one of the operations of *primitive recursive set functions*.

In 1953, Tarski and Smielew showed that *Robinson arithmetic* can be interpreted in a *weak set theory* whose axioms are
- extensionality
- the existence of the empty set
- the axiom of adjunction

In fact, extensionality is not even needed as the empty set and adjunction suffice to interpret Robinson arithmetic.
