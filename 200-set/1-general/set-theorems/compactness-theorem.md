# Compactness theorem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem

In mathematical logic, the **compactness theorem** states that a set of *first-order sentences* has a *model* if and only if every finite subset of it has a model.

This theorem is an important tool in model theory, as it provides a useful (but generally not effective) method for constructing models of any set of sentences that is *finitely consistent*.

The compactness theorem for the propositional calculus is a consequence of *Tychonoff's theorem* (which says that the product of compact spaces is compact) applied to *compact Stone spaces*, hence the theorem's name.

Likewise, it is analogous to the finite intersection property characterization of compactness in topological spaces: a collection of closed sets in a compact space has a non-empty intersection if every finite subcollection has a non-empty intersection.

The compactness theorem is one of the two key properties, along with the *downward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem*, that is used in *Lindström's theorem* to characterize first-order logic.

Although there are some generalizations of the compactness theorem to non-first-order logics, the compactness theorem itself does not hold in them, except for a very limited number of examples.
