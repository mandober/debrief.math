# ROADMAP

One the one hand, it seems ill advised to discuss many set-related concept without first fixing a particular set theory. On the other hand, though many central notions (including sets and classes) are defined differently across different set theories, some concepts are bound to be common to all of them. Such basic concepts are gathered and described in the section (folder) "basic concepts". In fact, this section about set theory can be divided according to the specific set theories, with the basic and common concepts collected under the umbrella of unformalized systems of *naive set theory*.

After all, this is exactly the name under which sets were studied initially. Naive set theory was a label for such unformalized investigations of sets (note that sometimes the same name is used for a fully axiomatized, formal set theory, where "naive" is supposed to indicate that the theory is exposed using informal language). This age of naivete has came to pass with the discovery of first set-related paradoxes, which have initiated the research into axiomatic set theories. The Russell's paradox, in particualar, has wracked havoc, prompting many to develop solutions to avoid it. Many of these solutions have been incorporated into formal set theories, but eventaully, it was the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice) that became the standard one, even taking the place as the theory at the FOM.
