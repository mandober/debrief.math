## Ops on a set

- universal class: 𝒰
- the empty set: ∅, ∅ ∈ 𝒰
- any set: A, A ∈ 𝒰
- insert an object x into a set A: {x} ∪ A
- remove an object x from a set A: A ∖ {x}
- Ax of Ext ⇒ order is immaterial, multiplicity is singular
- *warn*: to create new sets, must have a validated source set from which to pick elements
- {A, B} = { x | x = A ∨ x = B }
- A ∪ B = { x ∈ {A, B} | x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B }
- A ∩ B = { x ∈ A ∪ B | x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B }



x ∩ x = x     x ∪ x = x       idempotence
x ∩ 𝒰 = x     x ∪ ∅ = x       identity
x ∩ ∅ = ∅     x ∪ 𝒰 = 𝒰       domination




- x is a set?
- x is a family of sets, 𝓕
- x is a universal set, 𝒰
- x is an empty set, ∅
- x is a nonempty set
- x is a singleton set, {a}

- x is an unordered-pair set, {a,b}
- x and y are sets that are disjoint
- x and y are sets that overlap
- x and y are the only elements of a set, {x,y}
- unorder pair, {x,y}
- order pair, (x,y)
- x ∪ y union
- x ∪ y intersection
- x ∖ y relative difference
- y ∖ x relative difference
- x Δ y absolute difference

Relations between `x` and `y`
- `x = y`, x and y are equal
- `x ≠ y`, x and y are not equal

- `x ∈ y`, x is an element of y
- `y ∈ x`, y is an element of x

- `x ∉ y`, x is not an element of y
- `y ∉ x`, y is not an element of x

- `x ⊆ y`, x is a subset of y
- `y ⊆ x`, y is a subset of x

- `x ⊂ y`, x is a proper subset of y
- `y ⊂ x`, y is a proper subset of x




Boolean algebra:
- a ∧ b = min(a, b)
- a ∨ b = max(a, b)
- ¬a = 1 - a
- a ⇒ b = max(a-1, b)
- a ⇏ b = min(a-1, b)
- a ⇐ b = max(a-1, b)
- a ⇍ b = min(a-1, b)

x = x
x ≠ x

x = y
x ≠ y

x ∈ y
x ∉ y

(⊆): x ⊆ y ∨ y ⊆ x ∨ x = y
(⊂): x ⊂ y ∨ y ⊂ x

- x ∩ y = ∅ ==> x and y are disjoint sets
- x ∩ y ≠ ∅ ==> x and y are overlapping sets
- x ∩ y ≠ ∅ ==>


- `x ∩ y ≠ ∅` ==> x and y are overlapping sets and
  - x ⊆ y ∨ y ⊆ x ∨ x = y
  - x ⊂ y ∨ y ⊂ x
  - x ∈ y ∨ y ∈ x
