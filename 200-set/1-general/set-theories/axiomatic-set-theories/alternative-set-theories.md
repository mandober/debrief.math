# Alternative set theories

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/settheory-alternative/

*Alternative set theories* comprise the systems of set theory that are significantly different from the dominant ZF (Zermelo-Frankel set theory) and its close relatives.

Such alternative systems include
- typed theories of sets
- Zermelo set theory and its variations
- New Foundations and related systems
- positive set theories
- constructive set theories

An interest in the range of alternative set theories does not presuppose an interest in replacing the dominant set theory with one of the alternatives; acquainting ourselves with foundations of mathematics formulated in terms of an alternative system can be instructive as showing us what any set theory (including the standard one, i.e. ZF) is supposed to do for us. The study of alternative set theories can dispel a facile identification of set theory with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory - they are not the same thing.
