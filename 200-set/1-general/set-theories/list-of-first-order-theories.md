# List of first-order theories

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first-order_theories

In first-order logic, a first-order theory is given by a set of axioms in some language. This entry lists some of the more common examples used in model theory and some of their properties.

## Preliminaries

For every natural *mathematical structure* there is a *signature* `σ` listing the constants, functions, and relations of the theory together with their arities, so that the object is naturally a *σ-structure*. Given a signature σ there is a unique first-order language `Lσ` that can be used to capture the first-order expressible facts about the σ-structure.

There are two common ways to specify theories:
1. List or describe a set of sentences in the language `Lσ`, called the axioms of the theory.
2. Give a set of σ-structures, and define a theory to be the set of sentences in `Lσ` holding in all these models. For example, the "theory of finite fields" consists of all sentences in the language of fields that are true in all finite fields.

An `Lσ` theory may
- be consistent: no proof of contradiction exists
- be satisfiable: there exists a σ-structure for which the sentences of the theory are all true (by the completeness theorem, satisfiability is equivalent to consistency)
- be complete: for any statement, either it or its negation is provable
- have quantifier elimination
- eliminate imaginaries
- be finitely axiomatizable
- be decidable: There is an algorithm to decide which statements are provable
- be recursively axiomatizable
- be model complete or sub-model complete
- be κ-categorical: All models of cardinality κ are isomorphic
- be stable or unstable
- be ω-stable (same as totally transcendental for countable theories)
- be superstable
- have an atomic model
- have a prime model
- have a saturated model
