**Morse-Kelley set theory** (MK) is a first order axiomatic set theory that is closely related to von NBG set theory.

Morse-Kelley set theory is also known under these names:
- Morse-Kelley set theory (MK)
- Kelley-Morse set theory (KM)
- Morse-Tarski set theory (MT)
- Quine-Morse set theory (QM)
- the system of Quine and Morse

While NBG restricts bound variables in the schematic formula from appearing in the axiom schema of class comprehension to range over sets alone, MK allows these bound variables to range over proper classes as well as sets, as first suggested by Quine in 1940 for his system ML.

MK is named after mathematicians John L. Kelley and Anthony Morse and was first set out by Wang (1949) and later in an appendix to Kelley's textbook "General Topology" (1955), a graduate level introduction to topology. Kelley said the system in his book was a variant of the systems due to Thoralf Skolem and Morse. Morse's own version appeared later in his book A "Theory of Sets" (1965).

While NBG is a conservative extension of the canonical ZFC set theory, in the sense that a statement in the language of ZFC is provable in NBG ifff it is provable in ZFC, MK is a proper extension of ZFC. Unlike von NBG, where the axiom schema of class comprehension can be replaced with finitely many of its instances, MK cannot be finitely axiomatized.
