# Set Theory :: ZFC Axioms :: Axiom of Powerset

Summary
- axiom names:
  - Axiom of Powerset
  - Axiom of Power
- axiom short name: AxPow
- axiom schema: no
- statement: `∀A ∃P ∀x(x ⊆ A ⇔ x ∈ P)`
- status: one of the ZFC axioms
- consequences:
  - means to build larger sets
  - cardinality of 𝒫(A) is always way larger than the cardinality of A
  - cardinality of ℕ is countable, cardinality of 𝒫(ℕ) is uncountable
  - cardinality of 𝒫(ℕ) is the same as the cardinality of ℝ

## Description

**Axiom of the Powerset** states that for any given set A, there is a set that contains all the subsets of A as elements.
