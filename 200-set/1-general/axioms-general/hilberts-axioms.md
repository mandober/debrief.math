# Hilbert's axioms

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_axioms

Hilbert's axioms are a set of 20 assumptions proposed by David Hilbert in 1899 in his book "Grundlagen der Geometrie" (The Foundations of Geometry) as the foundation for a *modern treatment of Euclidean geometry*. Other well-known modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry are those of Alfred Tarski and of George Birkhoff.

## The axioms

Hilbert's axiom system is constructed with *6 primitive notions*:
- *3 primitive terms*:
  - point
  - line
  - plane
- *3 primitive relations* (one could count this as 6 relations as specified below, but Hilbert did not do so):
  - Betweenness, a ternary relation linking points
  - Lies on (Containment), 3 binary relations:
    - one linking points and straight lines
    - one linking points and planes
    - one linking straight lines and planes
  - Congruence, 2 binary relations:
    - one linking line segments, denoted by an infix `≅`
    - one linking angles, denoted by an infix `≅`

Line segments, angles, and triangles may each be defined in terms of points and straight lines, using the relations of betweenness and containment. All points, straight lines, and planes in the following axioms are distinct unless otherwise stated.
