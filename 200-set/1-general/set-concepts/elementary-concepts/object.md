# Object

A mathematical object is a primitive - it can be anything that has a status of a standalone object in its own right.

In the context of set theory, an object can be an entity that is not a set, called *urelement*, but also sets, classes. Generally, objects are members of a set, that is, an entity is an object when considered per se, outside a set, and it becomes an *element*, when considered as a member of a set.

Practically, through, there are no objects outside sets; in a set theory, there is nothing but sets - only sets exist. Taken to the extreme (as we initially should) this means that "in the beginning" there was only a way to construct sets (the concept of a set), but there were no object around to use as elements. But maybe we don't need objects anyway - we can just make an empty set - a set containing nothing at all, denoted `âˆ…`. After all, it is the only thing that we can possibly construct in such a bare environemnt. However, once we do make the empty set, it becomes a standalone object, an object in its own right. So now we have our first object that we can use as an element!
