# Interval

An interval is a subset of numeric set.

Intervals are primarily used in connection with the set of the real numbers ℝ, where they signify subsets of ℝ.

An interval `(a, b)`, where a,b ∈ ℝ.

Intervals are characterized by two *endpoints* that act as its bounds. Above, `a` stands for the lower bound and `b` for the upper bound.

primarily divided into open and closed

## Interval notation

There are a few different ways that one can express with symbols a specific interval (all the numbers between two numbers). One way is with inequalities. If we wanted to denote the set of all numbers between, say, 2 and 4, we could write "all x satisfying 2 < x < 4". This excludes the endpoints 2 and 4 because we use < instead of ≤. If we wanted to include the endpoints, we would write "all x satisfying 2 ≤ x ≤ 4."

Another way to write these intervals would be with interval notation. If we wished to convey "all x satisfying 2 < x < 4" we would write (2, 4). This does not include the endpoints 2 and 4. If we wanted to include the endpoints we would write [2,4]. If we wanted to include 2 and not 4 we would write `[2,4)`; if we wanted to exclude 2 and include 4, we would write `(2,4]`.

Note that ∞ and −∞ must always have an exclusive parenthesis rather than an inclusive bracket. This is because ∞ is not a number, and therefore cannot be in our set. ∞ is really just a symbol that makes things easier to write, like the intervals above.

The interval (a,b) is called an open interval, and the interval [a,b] is called a closed interval.

Intervals are sets and we can use set notation to show relations between values and intervals. If we want to say that a certain value is contained in an interval, we can use the symbol ∈ to denote this. For example, 2∈[1,3]. Likewise, the symbol ∉ denotes that a certain element is not in an interval. For example 0∉(0,1).
