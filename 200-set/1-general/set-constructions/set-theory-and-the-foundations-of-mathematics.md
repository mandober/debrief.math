(referring to: Axiomatic set theory - Patrick Suppes, 1972)

Among the many branches of modern mathematics, set theory (intuitively, set or class is a collection of entities of any sort) occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions, the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets (or classes) of objects. This means that the various branches of mathematics may be formally defined within set theory. As a consequence, many fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics may be reduced to questions about set theory.

Personal note:
  Right from the start his book puts set theory, in particular ZF set theory, as the theory at the heart of all mathematics (which ZF set theory is as considered by many), but then back down and says "with a few rare exceptions" - a theory at the FOM must be such that the entirety of mathematics can be derived from it, not almost all of mathematics. If exceptions exists then the only conclusion is that set theory is not really a good candidate for the FOM. The case that be is probably that ZF is the best theory we've got for the FOM, even though it is doesn't deliver on what is expected from such a theory, but, hell, until a better one comes along â€¦tra-la-la, which as an "close but no cigar" attitude only erodes the rigor of mathematics.


Working mathematicians have one thing in common with laymen and that is the general disinterest in the fundations of mathematics. The question such as "What is a number?" are avoided at all cost and nobody today wants to descend into the cellar of math and disentangle the comfortable abstaractions back into the primitive notions. However, this wwasn't always the case as once many a mathematician did try to answer such questions. Characterization of the naturals, integers, rationals, real numbers has been a central problem for the classical research of Weierstrass, Dedekind, Kronecker, Frege, Peano, Russell, Whitehead, Brouwer, and many others.

Yet, the introduction of sets to mathematics was not made in the attempt to tackle the central problems on the nature of number, but as a tool used by Cantor in his investigations of infinite series during 1870's.

In 1874, Cantor published the famous proof that the set of real numbers cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. In 1878, Cantor introduced the fundamental notion that two sets are *equipollent* (or have the same power, today called *equinumerousity*) if they can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with each other.

Two finite sets are thus equivalent if they have the same number of elements, but for infinite sets the notion of power has lead to a generalization of the notion of natural numbers to that of *infinite cardinal numbers*. Development of the general *theory of transfinite numbers* was one of Cantor's great accomplishments.

From the standpoint of the foundations of mathematics, the philosophically revolutionary aspect of Cantor's work was his bold insistence on the *actual infinite*, that is, on the existence of infinite sets as mathematical objects in their own right, on a par with numbers and finite sets. Historically, the *concept of infinity* was as important as that of the number, which the philosophers since Aristotle were trying to tame.

Books on set theory usually provide an analysis of the concept of number and infinity, but many other topics, some controversial and important in the foundations, are traditionally also a part of the subject, including
- algebra of sets
- general theory of relations
- ordering relations
- general theory of functions
- finite sets
- cardinal numbers
- infinite sets
- ordinal numbers
- ordinal arithmetic
- transfinite induction
- transfinite recursion
- Axiom of Choice
- Zorn's Lemma
