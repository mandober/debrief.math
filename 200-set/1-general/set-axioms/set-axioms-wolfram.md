In the old interpretation, an *axiom* is a proposition regarded as self-evidently, intuitive truth.

Axioms do not require proof.

The word "axiom" is a slightly archaic synonym for *postulate*. Compare *conjecture* or *hypothesis*, both of which connote apparently true but not self-evident statements.
