# Set Cardinality


There are two ways to define the cardinality of a set:
- cardinality of a set is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity
- a representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the initial ordinal in that class. This is usually taken as the definition of cardinal number in axiomatic set theory.

*Equinumerosity* is the relation between two sets that have the same cardinality. It is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets.

Another way to define cardinality is to define it as a specific object.

The equivalence class of a set A under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as A.



**Cardinality** of a set is the size of a set.

For finite sets, the cardinality of a set is the concrete number of elements in a set.

Cardinality of a set $$S$$ is denoted by $$|S|$$, occasionally equated to $$n$$: $$|S| = n$$

An **infinite set** has infinitely many elements, thereby an infinite cardinality

a **finite set**, e.g. $$\{1,2,3, \dots,100\}$$ has finite cardinality (here the element after elipses is called **terminal set member**.


> Definition: The cardinality of S, denoted |S|, is the number of elements in S.



In fact, the size of integers and rationals is the same as the naturals, `|ℕ| = |ℤ| = |ℚ|`
