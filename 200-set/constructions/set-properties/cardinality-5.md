# Cardinality


## Cardinality of a set and its powerset

The cardinality of the power set is never the same as the cardinality of the original set. This can be proven with *Cantor's diagonal argument* familiar from the proof of the uncountability of the real numbers.

|A| < |𝒫(A)|

There is an injection `A ⟼ 𝒫(A)` that maps every element of `A` to a singleton set, `a₀ ⟼ {a₀}, …, aₙ ⟼ {aₙ}`, but many more elements of `𝒫(A)` are left unmatched. For finite sets, the existence of injection that is not surjection disproves the existence of bijection. However, it is not so for infinite sets.
