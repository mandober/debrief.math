# Cardinal number

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number

Cardinal numbers are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality of sets.

The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number i.e. the number of elements in a set. The *transfinite cardinal numbers*, often denoted using `‚Ñµ` with a subscript, describe the sizes of infinite sets.

Due to Cantor, cardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions: two sets have the same cardinality iff there is a bijection between them.

A fundamental theorem, due to Cantor, shows that it's possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, which implies the existence of infinities of different sizes. For example, the cardinality (infinity) of |‚Ñù| > |‚Ñï|.

It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set, e.g. |ùîº| = |‚Ñï| (where `ùîº` are even naturals).

> There is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:
>> 0, 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, n, ‚Ä¶; ‚Ñµ‚ÇÄ, ‚Ñµ‚ÇÅ, ‚Ñµ‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶, ‚Ñµ‚ç∫, ‚Ä¶

This sequence starts with the natural numbers (finite cardinals), which are followed by the aleph numbers (infinite cardinals of well-ordered sets). The aleph numbers are indexed by ordinal numbers. Under the assumption of the axiom of choice, this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal number. If one rejects that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.
