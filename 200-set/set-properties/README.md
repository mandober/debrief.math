# Set properties

Sets
* Set types
  * by cardinality
    - the empty set, 0-set
    - singleton set, 1-set
    - pair set, 2-set
    - n-set
    - non-empty set
  * by finiteness
    - finite
    - infinite
      - countable
      - uncountable
  * by content
    - set of objects
    - set of sets
    - set of subsets (of some set)
    - set of ordered pairs
    - class of sets
    - family of subsets
  * by container/contained
    - object
    - element, member
    - urelement
    - set
    - large set
    - class
    - proper class
    - conglomerate

* Set properties
  * Fundamental set properties
    - non-order
    - uniqueness of elements
    * Alternatives:
      - multiset
      - sequence
  * Set properties
    - finiteness

    - rank
  * containment properties (props from a containment relation)
    - disjoint sets
    - pairwise disjoint sets
    - overlapping sets
    - proper subset, proper superset
    - subset, superset
