The cardinality of a countably infinite set is denoted by `ω` or `ℵ₀`.

- ℕ is countable
- ℤ is countable
- ℚ is countable
- ℝ is uncountable
- 𝔸 (the set of algebraic numbers) is countable.
- Algebraic numbers are a countable subset of ℝ.
- Transcendental real numbers exist.

- The union of countably many countable sets is countable.
- The Cartesian product of finitely many countable sets is countable.
- The powerset of a countable set is uncountable.

- The set of k element sequences formed from a countable sets is countable.
- The set of finite sequences formed from a countable set is countable.
- The set of convergent sequences of natural numbers is countable.

- The set of polynomials with integer coefficients is countable.
- The set of functions that map a finite subset of a given countable set `A` into a given countable set `B` is countable.

- The set of subintervals of ℝ with rational endpoints is countable.
- Any disjoint collection of open intervals (open sets) on ℝ (in ℝⁿ) is countable.
- Any discrete set in ℝ (in ℝⁿ) is countable.
- Any open subset of ℝ is a disjoint union of countably many open intervals.

- If A is infinite and B is countable, then A ∪ B ∼ A.
- If A is uncountable and B is countable, then A \ B ∼ A
