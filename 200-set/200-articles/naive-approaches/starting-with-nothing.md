# Starting with nothing

This article explores the situation in which we start with nothing - with no mathematical objects at all - only with the notion of sets, i.e. we only have the means to construct a set. This, "clean room", approach tries to test the claim that set theory (ZF in particular, but we'll start naive) can indeed be used to derive the entirety of mathematics. At least that is what is required from a theory set as the foundation of mathematics (FOM). Here, we just try to see if and how much of the basic mathematical objects (tuples, natural numbers, integers, rationals) can we "recover" using nothing but sets.

Articles with the titles like
- In the beginning, there was a void…
- Everything from nothing
- From void to numbers
- The empty set is all you need
- The empty set is sufficient
- The "clean room" approach

and such, deal with the same subject and have the same goal - trying to recover some elementary mathematical objects using only sets. In fact, any axiomatic set theory has the same goal, only it starts with a set of axioms. Here, we are taking the naive approach, just describing some interesting constructions in an unformalized manner.
