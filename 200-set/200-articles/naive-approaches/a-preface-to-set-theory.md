# A preface to set theory

Set theory is the name for a large branch of mathematics that studies collections of objects, but, perhaps unexpectedly, also includes topics on relations, orders, functions, domains, infinity, uncountable infinity, countable infinity, aleph, aleph naught, continuum, continuum hypothesis, Dedekind cut, diagonalization, axiom of choice, axiom of unrestricted comprehension, axiom of comprehension, cardinals, large cardinals, ordinals, ordinal arithmetics, transcedental numbers, transfinite numbers, mathematical induction, transfinite induction, well-ordering, infinite descending chains.

We can carve out a suitably small area for initial study, an area that perhaps matches the one at the dawn of set theory when the surface was relatively small. Such investigation of sets, conducted in an unformalized manner and using informal language in a relaxed setting is usually called *naive set theory*. Probably the biggest reason for the "naivete" of this approach is the problem of a set of all sets. But before that, we should take a traditional approach to theorems and start from the beginning.

## In the beginning

…there was nothing. An eternal, but nevertheless temporary, void - an ambiguous void indeed.

…not only was the void long forgotten, but there was too many stuff accumulated during a couple of millenias.

In the first scenario, set theory boots into a distraction free mode, with a void for a canvas, then proceeds to incorporate things as it "invents" them on the fly.

In the second scenrio, set theory starts amidst the things, first carving out some space for itself, then proceeding to incorporate all existing things.

In both cases, the goal is the same - to come up with a tightly run theory of sets that can incorporate all other things mathematical. In fact, the only difference between the two scenarios is the amount of pretending.
