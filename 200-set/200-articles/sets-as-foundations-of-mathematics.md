# Set theory :: Set theory as the foundations of mathematics

The foundations of modern mathematics is a branch of mathematics that studies the most primitive mathematical concepts and objects, investigating how mathematics could be build starting from those atomic notions.

Set theory, specifically ZFC, is considered by the majority of mathematicians as the theory at the foundations of modern mathematics.

A theory that is to be the foundational theory of mathematics must be the most fundamental theory, the atomic objects of which can be used to derive the rest of mathematics.

With set theory enjoying this prestigeous role, means that we should be able to build the entirety of mathematics using nothing but sets as the most atomic mathematical objects.

>Can math be founded on sets alone?

Mathematicians, for one, couldn't care less. That's right. Most have patience only for the work in their field of interest, never even thinking about the foundations. Most would happily hand over the foundational concerns over to logicians to maul over, as they did before (it was a failure).

If pressed about the foundations, majority recognizes ZFC as the foundational theory, but do not care about the minutia. Things were abstracted and the implementations details are long forgotten, so there's no need to go back there.

Most mathematicians are content just knowing that there is a theory at the foundations of math, that it works well enough, and that, if absolutely, life-or-death necessary, it is possible to derive the rest of math from it. Most perhaps don't know how to do it, but they know that, in principle, it can be done and leave it at that.

Formalists are particularly delighted that set theory got the honors, with constructivists always pushing for a better, more suitable theory as the cornerstone of all mathematical knowledge. Type theorist favor type theory (which?) at the foundations. Categorists see category theory, as the most abstract theory in all of mathematics, to fill that position perfectly.

A notable candidate is category theory as a general, and univalent foundations with homotopy type theory as a particular approach to type theory, which amounts to establishing constructive type theory as a new foundational language of mathematics. Univalent foundations are closely tied to the idea of the foundations of mathematics being implemented in a proof assistant software.
