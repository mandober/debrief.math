This sections contains only the basic concepts about sets. Some concepts about sets, although considered basic, are only mentioned here but explored in another (appropriate) section, as specified. Still, the two sections to which most topics are delegated is ordered theory, relation theory and function theory. In fact, since set theory (i.e. ZF set theory) is (still) the foundation of mathematics, many topics that could be located here are actually delagated elsewhere.

What constitutes the basic set notions is, of course, completely arbitrary, but here's one approach.

Stick to fundamentals only! Don't you stay! from a narrow way.




- Fundamentals
  - set
  - empty set
  - non-empty set
  - finite set
  - infinite set
  - set membership
    - membership relation
  - set inclusion
    - inclusion relation

    - superset, proper superset
    - characteristic function
    - well-founded relation
