# New terms

New terms:
- related collections
  - set: unordered, uniqueness of elements
  - multiset (bag): unordered, non-uniqueness (multiplicity)
  - list: ordered, non-uniqueness
  - unordered list: not interesting
- set properties
  - set is a math primitive, it hasno definition
  - contains math objects
  - no notion of order
  - notion of element uniqueness, collapses multiple element copies into one
    - notion of element identity
    - comparision of elements
    - alt: no notion of uniqueness at all - set contains what 
      the characteristic function says, e.g. `isElem :: Set a -> Bool`
      but how do we determine its elements then? By querying all naturals? What about other kinds of elements?
