# Notion of a set

Sets were introduced by the German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845-1918). His work in 1874-1884 marks the origin of the set theory. Cantor introduced the concept of a set saying:

>"A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite distinct objects of our perception or thought, called the elements of the set".



Today, we say that a set is a collection of objects, called its members. In math, these objects will, naturally, be mathematical objects, primarily numbers, and sets will be "almost homogeneous", i.e. containing the same base type of objects. On the nose, a heterogeneous set would contain any type of objects at all (like a cow, a tringle and a red shoe), but less dramatically, even a set like `{2, {3}, 4, {{5,6}}}` is heterogeneous, since it contains 3 types of objects - numbers, sets of numbers, sets of sets of numbers. However, we could informally say that its base type of objects are integers. This goes to show that once constructed, a set becomes a mathematical object in its own right, distinct from other mathematical objects. Most importantly, an object is distinct from a set containing that object as its only element, `1 ≠ {1}`; however, it feels strangle writing `0 ≠ {}` since in pretty much any encoding of natural numbers as sets, zero is indeed represented by an empty set.
