# Membership relation

Membership relation is the fundamental primitive of sets and set theories. It is denoted by the symbol `∈`, which was introduced by Peano and which he adopted from the Latin letter 'e' - the first letter of the verb 'est' (to be).

In naive set theory, set is an undefined primitive and so is the membership relation. In axiomatic set theories, membership relation could be defined in various ways. For example, in the set theory that first establihes the universe U that contains all objects, the set membership `x ∈ U` denotes the fact that any set, `x`, is a member of the universe `U`, i.e. a set is defined as being a member of the universe `U` - if something is in U then that something is a set.

Symbols related to set membership are: `∈`, `∉`, `∋`, `∌`. However is the basic symbol `∈` introduced - by intuition or definition - the other symbols can be defined in terms of it.

In fact, the elementary relation, `x ∈ S`, is a proposition, and as all propositions it may be true or false.



`∉` can be defined
