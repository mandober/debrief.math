**Cantor's first set theory article** contains Georg Cantor's first theorems of *transfinite set theory*, which studies infinite sets and their properties.

One of these theorems is his revolutionary discovery that ℝ is *uncountably infinite* (rather than countably infinite, like ℕ).

This theorem is proved using **Cantor's first uncountability proof**, which differs from the more familiar proof using his diagonal argument. The title of the article, "On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers" ("Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen"), refers to its first theorem: the set of real algebraic numbers is countable. Cantor's article was published in 1874. In 1879, he modified his uncountability proof by using the topological notion of a set being dense in an interval.
