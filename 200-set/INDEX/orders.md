# ST :: Orders

Orders are thoroughly investigated in their own section (in the folder `/math/240-ord`), but here is the summary of the most important information.

All orders are relations, but not vice versa. Orders are particulary interesting relations on a single set (i.e. homogeneous relations or endorelations). Usually all elements of a set are engaged in an order. Actually, an order is total is any two elements of a sets are *comparable*; otherwise, it is said that not all elements are comparable, i.e. some pairs of elements are incompatible (cannot be compared), usually denoted `x‖y`. Comparable elements are either related under some relation `R` or `~`, denoted by `x~y` or `xRy`, or not denoted by `¬(x~y)`, that is `¬(xRy)` or just `x¬Ry`.

Thus, in the context of a relation (or an order) `R`, a pair of elements of a given set may be
- uncomparable, `x‖y` wrt `R`
- comparable
  - related by R, `xRy`, i.e. `(x,y) ∈ R`
  - not related by R, `x¬Ry` or `¬(xRy)`, i.e. `(x,y) ∉ R`

Relation that is an order may be generally denoted by `≤`, e.g. `x ≤ y`. Strictly, the symbol `≤` represents the "less then or equal" (LE) relation, but it is often used to represent any similar relations as well, especially orders where it stands for "preceds", x ≤ y.
