# Set Theory: Definitions

The concept of sets
- set is undefined, it is a *mathematical primitive*.
- once sets are introduced they are mathematical objects in their own right.

The empty set
- the empty set may also be introduces as an undefined primitive, by definition, or as an axiom
- there exists exactly one empty set and it denoted by `∅`, the empty set.

in fact, the existence of the empty set is sufficient to derive many mathematical concepts and objects, such as the natural numbers.


Set membership
- a set consists of *mathematical objects* called *elements* or *members*
- the fact that an object `a` is a member of a set `S` is denoted by `a ∈ S`
- a set is *well-defined*, meaning that if `S` is a set and `a` is some object, then either `a` is definitely in S, `a ∈ S` or `a` is definitely not in `S`, denoted by `a ∉ S`. Thus, we should never consider *some* objects that share some property as being elements of a set, but *all* objects that share some property.

Set specification
- extensional and intensional specification

- set elements may be specified descriptively, e.g. "the set of the primes".
- set elements may be specified explicitly by listing the memebers between the braces, `{a,b,c}`
- set elements may be specified using the set-builder notation, `{ x | P(x) }`, which admits objects into the set if they satisfy some characterizing property.
