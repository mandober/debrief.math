# Set Theory âˆ· Summary

- set is an undefined mathematical object, thus a primitive.
- set is an *unordered* collection of unique objects called its elements.
- sets have no notion of order; ordering is an alien concepts to sets.
- sets recognize the concept of *uniqueness* of elements.

Uniqueness works in mysterious ways:
- duplicated objects are collapsed into one on becoming set elements.
- duplicated elements continue to exist even in the same enclosing set, but set operations behave as if it contained no duplicates.

The latter concept is cosistent with the view that sets are opaque objects whose contents cannot be examined directly - a set may only be queried to see if it contains some specific object. This implies that some objects are available directly, so we can use these in the queries; otherwise, we'd have no way of knowing what objects to query sets for (and plugging random objects in the queries seems unreasonable).
