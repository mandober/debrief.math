*"The army of those who have made at least one definite contribution to mathematics as we know it, soon becomes a mob as we look back over history; 6000 or 8000 names press forward for some word from us to preserve them from oblivion, and once the bolder leaders have been recognised, it becomes largely a matter of arbitrary, illogical legislation to judge who of the clamouring multitude shall be permitted to survive and who condemned to be forgotten."*
-- Eric Temple Bell, "Men of Mathematics", 1937

* Nikola Tesla
https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Mathematician:Nikola_Tesla
Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was the Serbian-American physicist, inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, great visonary and futurist known for a myriad of inventions and inovations and, above all, ideas, for many of which he was recognized, many have been stolen, allowing other people to take full credit for many works, with the trend that in a number of such cases the credit was reattributed fully or partially, at least, back to Tesla. Tesla is best knwon for his invention of the XX century, the big part of which are his inventions related to the modern AC (alternating current) electricity system. Tesla had deep intellectual, firm altruistic tendencies, and the level of overall integrity that very few men before or after him managed to endure. Along with his modisty and his famously blatant disregard for money, supported by the impermeability to corruption and greed, have (of course) secured him the miserable consitions in which he will spent his old years, devoid of even elementary resources. Tesla is remembered as the last man that tried nicely but was treated poorly, instilling on the humanity his last message: "man, better beware in this world-eat-man world, better put that vicious bastard cap on".

* Jovan Karamata (1902-1967)
Serbian mathematician working in analysis. Introduced what is now known as Karamata notation for Stirling numbers.

* Miodrag S. Petković (b. 1948)
Serbian mathematician and computer scientist specializing in the theory of iterative processes for solving nonlinear equations and interval mathematics. Also known for his anthologies of mathematical puzzles.

* Aleksandar Ivić (b. 1949)
Serbian mathematician notable for his work on the Riemann Zeta function.
