# Set theory :: Index :: Cardinalities

Countably infinite sets:
- ℕ
- ℤ
- ℚ

Uncountably infinite sets:
- ℝ
- ℂ
- 𝒫(ℕ)
- 𝒫(ℤ)
- 𝒫(ℚ)


All number sets are infinite. However, some infinities are the same while some infinities are bigger than others. The infinity of the naturals numbers is the same as the infinity of odd natural numbers, which is the same as the infinity of integers and rational numbers. All these infinities are countable (enumerable) and have the cardinality `ℵ₀`.

There are bigger infinities that are uncountable (inenumerable). These are the infinities of real and complex numbers. Their cardinality is `𝖈`, which is also referred to as the cardinality of the continuum (continuous number line).

The continuum hypothesis, that is, the question of whether there is an infinity with cardinality between `ℵ₀` and `𝖈` is resolved in the negative.
