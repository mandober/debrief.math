# List of set identities and relations

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_set_identities_and_relations

This article lists mathematical properties and laws of sets, 
involving the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection, and complementation and the relations of set equality and set inclusion.

It also provides systematic procedures for evaluating expressions, and performing calculations, involving these operations and relations.

The binary operations of set union and intersection satisfy many identities. Several of these identities have well-established names.
