# Basic set operations

* Set operations
  * Basic set relations
    - membership relation
    - inclusion relation
  * Basic set predicates
    - is an element of,      x ∈ A
    - is a subset of,        A ⊆ B (A is contained in B)
    - is a proper subset of, A ⊂ B (A is completely contained in B)
    - are disjoint,          A ⋂ B = ∅
    - are overlapping,       A ⋂ B ≠ ∅
    - A is in B,             A ⊆ B
    - are equal,             A = B ⟺ (A ⊆ B ⟺ B ⊆ A)
  * Basic set operations
    - union,                    A ⋃ B
    - intersection,             A ⋂ B
    - relative difference on A, A \ B
    - relative difference on B, B ∖ A
    - absolute difference,      A Δ B = A\B ⋃ B∖A
    - complementation,          A̅ = 𝓤 ∖ A
