# Set theory :: Index :: Fundamental sets

This is an enumeration of sets considered to be fundamental in mathematics. As such they have a name, and most have a symbol uniquely associated with them.

- Fundamental sets
  - General sets
    - the empty set, `∅`
    - the universal set, `𝓤`
    - the powerset, `𝒫(S)`
  - Number sets
    - Basic number sets
      - `𝔹`, the Boolean domain
      - `ℕ`, the set of natural numbers
      - `ℤ`, the set of integers
      - `ℚ`, the set of rational numbers
      - `ℝ`, the set of real numbers
      - `ℂ`, the set of complex numbers
    - Extended basic number sets
      - `ℍ`, the set of Hamiltonian numbers
      - `𝕆`, the set of octinion numbers
    - Other number sets
      - `ℙ`, the set of prime numbers
      - `𝔸`, the set of algebraic numbers

    - All number sets and derived sets
      - the set of natural numbers, `ℕ`, ℕ = {0,1,2,…}
        - the set of positive natural numbers, `ℕᐩ`, ℕ ∖ {0}
        - the set of whole numbers, `𝕎` (usually, 𝕎 = ℕᐩ)
        - the set of prime numbers, `ℙ`
        - the set of composite numbers, ℕ ∖ ℙ
      - the set of integers, `ℤ` (from German 'Zahlen')
        - the set of odd numbers
        - the set of even numbers
        - the set of mod `m` numbers, `ℤ/mℤ`
          - the set of mod 2 numbers, `ℤ/2ℤ`
          - the set of mod 3 numbers, `ℤ/3ℤ`
        - the set of positive integers, `ℤᐩ`
        - the set of negative integers, `ℤ⁻`
        - the set of non-negative integers, `ℤᐩ ∪ {0}`
        - the set of non-positive integers, `ℤ⁻ ∪ {0}`
        - ℤ ∪ {⁻∞, ᐩ∞}
      - the set of rational numbers, `ℚ` (from 'quotient')
        - `ℚ = {p/q : p ∈ ℤ, q ∈ ℕ }`
        - ℚ ∪ {⁻∞, ᐩ∞}
      - the set of real numbers, `ℝ`
        - ℝ ∪ {⁻∞, ᐩ∞}
      - the set of complex numbers, `ℂ`
        - `ℂ = {a,b,i | a,b ∈ ℝ} i = √-1`
