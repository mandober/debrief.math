  - universal class
  - congomerate
- Set equality
  - equal sets
  - equivalent sets
  - equinumerous sets
  - isomorphic sets
- By cardinality
  - empty set
  - empty class / null class / void class
  - singleton set / unit set
  - unordered pair, 2-element set
  - ordered pair
  - finite set

  - countably infinite set
  - uncountably infinite set
- By relation
  - disjoint sets
  - pairwise disjoint sets
  - overlapping sets
  - membership relation

## Endowed sets

An endowed set is set endowed with an additional structure, like an ordering, and like the underlying (carrier) set of all algebraic structures.

- Well-ordered set: set without infinite descending chains
- Ordered set: set endowed with an ordering
- Separoid
- Algebraic structures
- Setoid
