## Intro

When Georg Cantor shifted his focus from number theory to investigating the trigonometric series, he uncovered important results on irrational numbers, inventing set theory along the way.

Richard Dedekind, working independently on irrational numbers, publishing his findings in the paper "Continuity and irrational numbers".

In `1874`, Cantor published an article in "Crelle's Journal", marking the birth of set theory. In `1978`, he puiblished a follow-up paper, also in "Crelle's Journal", right when the set theory became the centre of controversy. Namely, **Kronecker** was on the editorial staff of "Crelle's Journal" and he was immensly displeased with Cantor's new ideas, pressuring Cantor to withdraw his paper. Cantor was molding this over, but Dedekind managed to persuade him not to falter. **Weierstrass** also supported the publication which finally happend. The paper was published, but Cantor never submitted any further work to "Crelle's Journal".

## Two kinds of infinity

In his `1874` paper, Cantor considers at least *two kinds of infinity*. Before him, orders of infinity did not exist, as all infinite collections were considered to have the same size. Cantor was examining the set of *algebraic real numbers*, that is, the set of all real roots of equations of the form:    
`aₙnₙ + aₙ˗₁xₙ˗₁ + … + a₁x + a₀ = 0`, where `aᵢ` is an integer.

>Cantor proved that the algebraic real numbers are in one-one correspondence with the natural numbers, meaning these two sets had the same size.

For an equation of the form above, define its index to be    
`|aₙ| + |aₙ˗₁| + … + |a₁| + |a₀| + n`

then, there is only one equation of index 2, namely x = 0, and there are 3 equations of index 3, namely, 2x = 0, x + 1 = 0, x - 1 = 0, x² = 0, giving the roots of 0, 1, and -1. For each index there are only finitely many equations and so only finitely many roots. Putting them in bijection with the natural numbers is now clear, but ordering them in order of index and increasing magnitude within each index.

In the same paper Cantor shows that ℝ cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with ℕ using the argument of *nested intervals*, which was more complex than the one used today (due to Cantor's paper in 1891). Cantor then remarked that this proved the theorem due to **Liouville**, namely, that there are infinitely many transcendental (i.e. non-algebraic) numbers in each interval.

In his next paper (the one from `1978` which he had trouble publishing in "Crelle's Journal"), Cantor introduced the idea of *equivalence of sets*, postulating that *two sets have the same power (i.e. they are equipotent or equivalent) if they can be put in a 1-to-1 correspondence*.

Cantor borrowed the word "power" from **Steiner**. Cantor proves that ℚ have the smallest infinite power, and also shows that ℝⁿ has the same power as ℝ. He further shows that countably many copies of ℝ still have the same power as ℝ (although Cantor did not use the term "countable", introducing it only later, in his 1883's paper).

Cantor has published a 6-part treatise on set theory from `1879` to `1884`.

This work appears in "Mathematische Annalen", and it was a brave move by the editor to publish this work despite the growing opposition to Cantor's ideas. Kronecker, who was extremely influential in the world of mathematics, was the leader of this opposition. Kronecker's criticism was built on the fact that set theory was incompatible with *constructive mathematics*. On this view, the only accepted mathematical objects were the ones that can be constructed finitely from an intuitively given set of natural numbers.

When Lindemann proved that π is transcendental in `1882`, Kronecker said: "Of what use is your beautiful investigation of π. Why study such problems when irrational numbers do not exist". Certainly, different kinds of infinities were impossible in this view.

However, Cantor continued his work and his 5th paper in the 6-part treatise on set theory, published in `1883`, discusses *well-ordered sets*.

Cantor introduces *ordinal numbers* as the *order types* of well-ordered sets. He also defines addition and multiplication of *transfinite numbers*, giving a fuller account of transfinite arithmetic in his later works.

Cantor used a big portion of the paper to justify his work. He says that mathematics can admit any concept provided it is free of contradictions and defined in terms of previously accepted concepts. Cantor mantions many previous authors who expressed their opinions on infinity, citing Aristotle, Leibniz, Descartes, Berkeley, Bolzano.


The year `1884` was one of crisis for Cantor. He was unhappy with his position at Halle and would have liked to move to Berlin. However this move was blocked by Schwarz and Kronecker. In `1884` Cantor wrote 52 letters to Mittag-Leffler each one of which attacked Kronecker. In this year of mental crisis Cantor seemed to lose confidence in his own work and applied to lecture on philosophy rather than on mathematics. The crisis did not last too long and by early 1885 Cantor was recovered and his faith in his own work had returned. However, despite a wealth of important work in the years after `1884`, there is some indication that he never quite reached the heights of genius that his remarkable papers showed over the 10 year period from `1874` to `1884`.


Although it was not of major importance for the development of set theory, it is worth mentioning that Peano has introduced the symbol `∈` for the set membership in `1889`, deriving the symbol from the first letter 'e' of the Greek word meaning "is" (to be).


In `1885`, Cantor continued to extend his theory of cardinal numbers and of order types. He extended his theory of order types so that now his previously defined ordinal numbers became a special case. 

In `1895` and `1897` Cantor published his final double treatise on sets theory. It contains an introduction that looks like a modern book on set theory, defining set, subset, etc. Cantor proves that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A then A and B are equivalent. This theorem was also proved by Felix Bernstein and independently by E. Schröder.

The dates `1895` and `1897` are important for set theory in another way. 

In `1897`, the first published paradox appeared, published by Cesare Burali-Forti. Some of the impact of this paradox was lost since Burali-Forti got the definition of a well-ordered set wrong! However, even if the definition was corrected, the paradox remained. It basically revolves round the set of all ordinal numbers. The ordinal number of the set of all ordinals must be an ordinal and this leads to a contradiction. It is believed that Cantor discovered this paradox himself in `1885` and wrote to Hilbert about it in 1886. This is slightly surprising since Cantor was highly critical of the Burali-Forti paper when it appeared. 

The year `1897` was important for Cantor in another way, for in that year the first International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Zurich and at that conference Cantor's work was held in the highest esteem being praised by many including Hurwitz and Hadamard.

In `1899` Cantor discovered another paradox which arises from the set of all sets. What is the cardinal number of the set of all sets? Clearly it must be the greatest possible cardinal yet the cardinal of the set of all subsets of a set always has a greater cardinal than the set itself. It began to look as if the criticism of Kronecker might be at least partially right since extension of the set concept too far seemed to be producing the paradoxes.

The 'ultimate' paradox was found by Russell in `1902` (and found independently by Zermelo). It simplify defined a set `A = { X | X ∉ X }`. Russell then asked "Is A an element of A"? Both the assumption that A is a member of A and A is not a member of A lead to a contradiction. The set construction itself appears to give a paradox.

Russell wrote to Frege telling him about the paradox. Frege had been near completion of his major treatise on the foundations of arithmetic. Frege added an acknowledgement to his treatise.

A scientist can hardly meet with anything more undesirable than to have the foundation give way just as the work is finished. In this position I was put by a letter from Mr Bertrand Russell as the work was nearly through the press.

By this stage, however, set theory was beginning to have a major impact on other areas of mathematics. Lebesgue defined 'measure' in `1901` and in `1902` defined the Lebesgue integral using set theoretic concepts. Analysis needed the set theory of Cantor, it could not afford to limit itself to intuitionist style mathematics in the spirit of Kronecker. Rather than dismiss set theory because of the paradoxes, ways were sought to keep the main features of set theory yet eliminate the paradoxes.

Did the paradoxes come from the 'Axiom of choice'? Cantor had used the 'Axiom of choice' without feeling that it was necessary to single it out for any special treatment. The first person to explicitly note that he was using such an axiom seems to have been Peano in `1890` in dealing with an existence proof for solutions to a system of differential equations. Again in `1902` it was mentioned by Beppo Levi but the first to formally introduce the axiom was Zermelo when he proved, in `1904`, that every set can be well-ordered. This theorem had been conjectured by Cantor. Émile Borel pointed out that the Axiom of Choice is in fact equivalent to Zermelo's Theorem.

Gödel showed, in `1940`, that the Axiom of Choice cannot be disproved using the other axioms of set theory. 

It was not until `1963` that Paul Cohen proved that the Axiom of Choice is independent of the other axioms of set theory.

Russell's paradox had undermined the whole of mathematics in Frege's words. Russell, trying to repair the damage, made an attempt to put mathematics back onto an logical basis in his major work Principia Mathematica written with Whitehead. This work attempts to reduce the foundations of mathematics to logic and was extremely influential. However the method of avoiding the paradoxes by introducing a 'theory of types' made it impossible to say that a class was or was not a member of itself. It did not seem a very satisfactory way around the problems and others sought different ways.

Zermelo in `1908` was the first to attempt an axiomatisation of set theory. Many other mathematicians attempted to axiomatise set theory. Fraenkel, von Neumann, Bernays and Gödel are all important figures in this development. Gödel showed the limitations of any axiomatic theory and the aims of many mathematicians such as Frege and Hilbert could never be achieved.
