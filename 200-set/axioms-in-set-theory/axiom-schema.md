# Axiom schema

An **axiom schema** is a formula in the *metalanguage* of an axiomatic system, in which one or more *schematic variables* appear. These variables, which are metalinguistic constructs, stand for any term or subformula of the system, which may or may not be required to satisfy certain conditions. Often, such conditions require that certain variables are free, or that certain variables do not appear in the subformula or term.

A **schema** is a linguistic "template" together with a rule for using it to specify a potentially infinite multitude of phrases, sentences, or arguments, which are called *instances of the schema*. Schemas are used in logic to specify rules of inference, in mathematics to describe theories with infinitely many (related) axioms, and in semantics to give adequacy conditions for definitions of truth.
