# Symmetric difference

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference

The **symmetric difference** (or disjunctive union) of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. That is, symmetric difference is the set of those elements which are in A or B, but not in both A and B, which makes it correspond to the logical XOR operator, `⊕`.



A ⊖ B = A △ B = { x | ∀x((x ∈ A ⋁ x ∈ B) ⋀ (x ∈ A ⋀ x ∈ B)) }

The power set of any set becomes an abelian group under the operation of symmetric difference, with the empty set as the neutral element of the group and every element in this group being its own inverse. The power set of any set becomes a Boolean ring, with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring and intersection as the multiplication of the ring.
