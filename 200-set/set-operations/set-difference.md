# Set difference

Set difference
- relative difference (on A), `A \ B`
- relative difference (on B), `B ∖ A`
- absolute difference, `A Δ B` = A\B ⋃ B∖A

Relative difference corresponds to the subtraction operation from aritmetics

Relative difference is a non-commutative operation on sets A and B.



*Absolute difference* is a commutative operation on sets A and B, `A Δ B`, defined as the union of their relative differences:

`A Δ B := A\B ⋃ B∖A`
