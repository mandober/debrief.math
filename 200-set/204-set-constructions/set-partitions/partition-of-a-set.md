# Partition of a set

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set

A partition of a set is a grouping of its elements into non-empty subsets, in such a way that every element is included in exactly one subset.

Every equivalence relation on a set defines a partition of this set, and every partition defines an equivalence relation.

A set equipped with an equivalence relation (or a partition) is sometimes called a *setoid*, typically in type theory and proof theory.
