# Separoid

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separoid

A **separoid** is a binary relation between disjoint sets which is stable as an *ideal* in the *canonical order induced by inclusion*.

Many mathematical objects which appear to be quite different, find a common generalisation in the framework of separoids; e.g. graphs, configurations of convex sets, oriented matroids, and polytopes. Any countable category is an induced subcategory of separoids when they are endowed with homomorphisms (viz. mappings that preserve the so-called *minimal Radon partitions*).

In this general framework, some results and invariants of different categories turn out to be special cases of the same aspect; e.g. the pseudoachromatic number from graph theory and the Tverberg theorem from combinatorial convexity are simply two faces of the same aspect, namely, complete colouring of separoids.
