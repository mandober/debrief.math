# Family of sets



A family `(Aᵢ) {i ∈ I}` is sometimes denoted by `(Aᵢ)ɪ`.

For any set `I` and any family `(Xᵢ) {i ∈ I}` of sets, we can form the following sets:


Note that a *family and its image are different entities*. Moreover, a family is not determined by its image for essentially the same reason that a sequence (i.e. an ℕ-indexed family) is not determined by its set of values.
