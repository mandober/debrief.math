- Set operations
  - complement (inverse): `A' = A⁻¹`
  - union, `A ⋃ B`
  - disjoint union, 
  - intersection, `A ⋂ B`
  - difference, `A \ B`

- Universal set
  - found in non-standard variants of set theory
  - class, subclass, proper subclass
  - 𝓤 is a proper class (always a set, never an element)
  - 𝓤 contains everything
  - ∅ contains nothing
  - Relations between the universal and empty set
    - `𝓤 ⋃ ∅ = 𝓤`, `𝓤 ⋂ ∅ = ∅`, `𝓤 ∖ ∅ = 𝓤`, `𝓤' = ∅`, `∅' = 𝓤`
  - Relations between the universal and any set
    - `𝓤 ⋃ A = 𝓤`, `𝓤 ⋂ A = A`, `𝓤 ∖ A = A'`, `𝓤 = A ⋃ A'`
