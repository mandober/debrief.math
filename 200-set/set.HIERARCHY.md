# Set Theory: Hierarchy


* Algebras wrt sets
  - Monoid, `(S, ⋃, ∅)`
  - Monoid, `(S, ⋂, ∅)`
  - Group, `(S, ⋃, ∅)`, complement as inverse S' = S⁻¹
  - Group, `(S, ⋂, ∅)`, complement as inverse

* Index of all axioms
  - axiom of the empty set (assert ∅ exists)
  - axiom of pairing, A and A = {A, A} = {A}
  - axiom of choice

* Different axioms wrt set algebras
  - set axioms, identities, laws, principles
  - closure
  - associativity
  - identity (∅)
  - inverse (complement)
  - idempotency
  - absorption, annihilation, domination
  - commutativity
  - distributivity

* Mathematics and set theory
  - implementation of mathematics in set theory
  - set theoretical implementation of ℕ
  - set theory as the FOM

* Specifications of sets
  - intensional representation

    - roster
    - set-builder notation

  * Set cardinality
    - Finite sets
      - the empty set
      - nonempty set
      - singleton set
      - (unordered) pair
      - all finite sets are enumerable sets
    - Infinite sets
      - Infinite enumerable set
      - Infinite innumerable set
    - Universal set, `𝓤`
      - `𝓤` is a Proper Class (always a set, never an element)
      - `𝓤` contains everything
      - `∅` contains nothing
      - `𝓤 ⋃ ∅ = 𝓤`, `𝓤 ⋂ ∅ = ∅`, `𝓤 ∖ ∅ = 𝓤`, `𝓤' = ∅`, `∅' = 𝓤`
      - `𝓤 ⋃ A = 𝓤`, `𝓤 ⋂ A = A`, `𝓤 ∖ A = A'`, `𝓤 = A ⋃ A'`

    - overlapping sets
      - subset (superset)
        - powerset
      - proper subset (proper superset)
  - ordered pair
    - Cartesian product
    - family of sets
      - indexed set
