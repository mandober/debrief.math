https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_set_theory

Naïve set theory is a generic name for approaches to set theory that are not formalized, that lack axioms, or allow the use of unrestricted comprehension.

The Axiom of Comprehension names the central principle of naive set theory that allows any predicate to form a set. Such unrestricted set comprehension leads to paradoxes like the Russell's paradox.

The set-builder form, aka set comprehension, is the usual notation used to specifing sets, especially sets built according to a predicate, whose general form is `{ x | P(x) }`; it specifies a set whose elements are objects `x` that satisfy the predicate `P`. For example, `{ x ∈ ℕ | x ≡ 0 (mod 2) }` specifies the set of even natural numbers.
