This page lists some of the forking factors - the properties that lead to the grouping of set theories into different classes.

The primary factor that induces several classes of set theories has to do with the axioms.

First, the presence of axioms sharply divides the systems into naive set theories, which are devoid of axioms and have the unrestricted comprehension principle, and the axiomatic set theories, which are fully axiomatized.

Of the axiomatic set theories, the systems based on the ZF axioms are considered standard, while the other systems are non-standard. Some extensions of ZF are deemed conservative, with others then being non-conservative. ZFC is a non-conservative extension of ZF with the, traditionally controversal, axiom of choice.

An important aspect of any axiomatic set theory is how it deals with the paradoxes, especially the way in which it avoids the Russell's paradox, that arises if set comprehension is left unchecked.






Factors of classification of axiomatic set theories:
- standard (well-founded)
- non-standard (non-well-founded)
- conservative extensions
- non-conservative extensions
- the way they avoid the paradoxes, esp. the Russell's paradox
- universe
- hierarchy of universe sets
- cumulativity of the universe
- entities: urelement, (proper) set, (proper) class, conglomerate
- universe, class, conglomerate
- having a universe set within which all constructions take place
- only subsets of the universe are sets possible to construct
- self-reference
- well-foundedness is about dis/allowing self-containment
- infinite descending chains of membership
- well-foundedness accounts for a further split of set theories into:
- self-containment
- ramification
- stratification
- stratifiable formulae (e.g. `x ∈ y` is, but `x ∈ x` is not)
