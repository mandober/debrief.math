Quine's system of axiomatic set theory, NF, takes its name from the title "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic", which was a 1937 article which introduced it. The axioms of NF are extensionality together with stratified comprehension.

**New Foundations** (NF) is an axiomatic set theory, proposed in a 1937's article "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic" by Willard Van Orman Quine as a simplification of the theory of types of "Principia Mathematica".

In 1940 and in a revision of 1951, Quine introduced an extension of NF sometimes called "Mathematical Logic" or "ML" which included proper classes as well as sets.

NF has a universal set, so it's a *non-well founded set theory* i.e. it's an axiomatic set theory that **allows infinite descending chains of membership**, `… xₙ ∈ … x₂ ∈ x₁`

>NF avoids Russell's paradox by permitting only *stratifiable formulae* to be defined using the axiom (schema) of comprehension. 
For instance, `x ∈ y` is a stratifiable formula, but `x ∈ x` is not.

Much of this entry discusses NFU, an important variant of NF due to Jensen (1969) and exposited in Holmes (1998).
