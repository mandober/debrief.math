Unlike naive set theory with the principle of unrestricted comprehension, *axiomatic set theory* places restrictions on the allowed set constructions.

NOTE: The phrases "axiomatic set theory" and "naive set theory", just like the phrase "set theory", avoid articles like a course, sticking to the singular form without any article (no article is not the same as the null article). It seems as if people go outta their way to avoid writing "a set theory", "the set theory", and especially the plural forms like "set theories". On the other hand, sometimes it's understood that the singular form, such as "naive set theory", stands to mean any number, or even all, of naive set theories.

Axiomatic set theories restrict the possible set constructions by defining the set of axioms thatmust always be considered and satisfied, thereby restricting the sets whose construction is permitted.

Some of the well-known axiomatic set theories:
- Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF)
  - Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC)
- von Neumann-Bernays-GÃ¶del set theory (NBG)
- Morse-Kelley set theory (MK)
- Tarski-Grothendieck set theory (TG)
