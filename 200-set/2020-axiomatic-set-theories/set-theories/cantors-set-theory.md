# Set theory :: Set theories :: Cantor's set theory

After introducing the concept of a set, Georg Cantor's notions about sets are sometimes referred to as Cantor's set theory, although he didn't axiomatized his system.

Any set can be a universe, so long as the object of study is confined to that particular set. If the object of study is formed by the real numbers, then the real line ℝ, which is the real number set, could be the universe under consideration. Implicitly, this is the universe that Georg Cantor was using when he first developed modern naive set theory and cardinality in the 1870s and 1880s in applications to real analysis. The only sets that Cantor was originally interested in were subsets of ℝ.


Some believe that Cantor's set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes, which is difficulty to assert since Cantor didn't provide an axiomatization of his system.

By 1899, Cantor was aware of some paradoxes resulting the unrestricted interpretations of set theory - for instance, *Cantor's paradox* and the *Burali-Forti paradox* - but he didn't believe those discredited his theory.

*Cantor's paradox* can be derived from the above (false) assumption by having `P(x)` stand for the statement "`x` is a cardinal number".

Frege explicitly axiomatized a set theory in which a formalized version of naïve set theory can be interpreted; it was this version of Frege's set theory that Bertrand Russell addressed when he presented his paradox.
