# Set theory :: Types of sets :: Transitive set

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_set

A set `A` is a **transitive set** if either condition (equivalent) holds:
- whenever `x ∈ A` and `y ∈ x`, then `y ∈ A`
  `∀x∀y(x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ x -> y ∈ A)`
  all elems of each elem of A are also in A
- whenever `x ∈ A` and `x` is not an urelement, then `x ⊆ A`
  `∀x(x ∈ A -> x ⊆ A)`


Similarly, `M` is a **transitive class** if every element of `M` is a subset of `M`.
