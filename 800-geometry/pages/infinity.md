# Infinity

## Infinity symbol

The `∞` symbol denotes infinity, or, more precisely, it represents very big, enormous numbers, or, even more precisely, it represents the concept of an unending, forever increasing, sequence of numbers.

It is unspecified what kind of infinity `∞` represents; whether a countable or uncountable infinity. Thus, we cannot compare expressions with `∞`, we cannot evaluate something like `∞ - ∞`.

## Expressions with infinity

Expressions containing `∞` symbol cannot be compared. That is, an expression like `∞ - ∞` cannot be evaluated.

Defined:
- ∞ + 1 = ∞
- ∞ + 10¹⁰⁰ = ∞
- ∞ + ∞ = ∞
- ∞ × ∞ = ∞
- ∞ᵏ = ∞

Undefined:
- ∞ - ∞
- ∞ ÷ ∞
- 0 ÷ ∞
- ∞ ÷ 0
- 0 ÷ 0
- 0^∞
- ∞⁰
- √∞

- 0 ÷ ∞ = 0/∞ = 0
- 1 ÷ ∞ = 1/∞ ⇒ tends to 0
- lim{x→0} 1/x² = ∞


## About infinity

The concept of infinity is peculiar because there are different infinities, and some infinities are bigger then others. In fact, there is an infinite number of infinities. Most can be reached by iterating the powerset operation on ℕ.

The infinity of the set ℕ is the smallest, but equinumerous to ℤ and ℚ; these are the countable infinities - they can be placed into a one-to-one relation with the set of the counting numbers, ℕ (or sometimes 𝕎, for whole numbers that exclude zero). Hell, they may be listed even, although not completely since writing them down produces an infinite sequence of numbers. The rationals, ℚ, are listed by following a zig-zag pattern, courtesy of Cantor. These countable infinities are, in fact, the same infinity that is denoted by `ℵ₀` (aleph naught).

Unlike these sets, the infinity of the set of the real numbers, ℝ, is too large and uncountable. This infinity is also called the cantinuum, denoted by `𝖈`.

Infinities of the higher sets of numbers, ℂ, ℍ, etc. are uncountable as well. However, uncountable infinity may be "constructed" even with the set ℕ by taking its powerset, `𝒫(ℕ)`. The set 𝒫(ℕ) is uncountable, `|ℕ| < |𝒫(ℕ)|`.
