# Geometry :: Hypercube

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube

In geometry, a hypercube is an n-dimensional analogue of a square (n = 2) and a cube (n = 3).

A hypercube is a closed, compact, convex figure whose *1-skeleton* consists of groups of *opposite parallel line segments* aligned in each of the space's dimensions, perpendicular to each other and of the same length.

A unit hypercube's longest diagonal in `n` dimensions is equal to `√n`.

An n-dimensional hypercube is more commonly referred to as an *n-cube* or sometimes as an *n-dimensional cube*.

The term *measure polytope* is also used, notably in the work of H. S. M. Coxeter who also labels the hypercubes the *γn polytopes*. The hypercube is the special case of a *hyperrectangle* (also called an *n-orthotope*).

A *unit hypercube* is a hypercube whose sides have length of one unit. Often, the hypercube whose corners (or vertices) are the 2ⁿ points in ℝⁿ with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called the unit hypercube.

## Construction

A hypercube can be defined by increasing the numbers of dimensions of a shape:
- 0: A point is a hypercube of dimension zero
- 1: If one moves this point one unit length, it will sweep out a line segment, which is a unit hypercube of dimension one.
- 2: If one moves this line segment its length in a perpendicular direction from itself; it sweeps out a 2-dimensional square.
- 3: If one moves the square one unit length in the direction perpendicular to the plane it lies on, it will generate a 3-dimensional cube.
- 4: If one moves the cube one unit length into the fourth dimension, it generates a 4-dimensional unit hypercube, i.e. a *unit tesseract*.

This can be generalized to any number of dimensions. This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a *Minkowski sum*: the `d`-dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of `d` mutually perpendicular unit-length line segments, and is therefore an example of a *zonotope*.

The 1-skeleton of a hypercube is a *hypercube graph*.
