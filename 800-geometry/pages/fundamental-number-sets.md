## Fundamental Number Sets

The fundament number sets
- ℕ   the set of the natural numbers
- ℤ   the set of the integral numbers (integers)
- ℚ   the set of the rational numbers
- ℝ   the set of the real numbers
- ℂ   the set of the complex numbers

There are further sets still like but they are not much used in calculus
- ℍ   the set of the heptonions
- 𝕆   the set of the octonions
- and even more

Extended fundament number sets
- ℕ   Natural numbers (by default including 0)
- ℕ₀  Natural numbers (including 0)
- ℕᐩ  Natural numbers (excluding 0)
- 𝔼   Even numbers, `2n` for n ∈ ℕ, i.e. n = {0,1,2,…}, so 𝔼 = {0,2,4,…}
- 𝕆   Odd numbers, `2n+1` for n ∈ ℕ, so 𝕆 = {1,3,5,…}
      `2n-1` would make the odd numbers start from -1 for n ∈ ℕ
      `2n-1` would make the odd numbers start from  1 for n ∈ ℕᐩ
- ℙ   Prime numbers, p ∈ ℙ ⇒ p ∈ ℕ, {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,…}

- ℤ   Integers, {…,-2,-1,0,1,2,…}, {-∞, 0, ∞}
- ℤ⁻  Negative integers, ℤ ∖ ℕ (exclude 0)
- ℤᐩ  Positive integers, ℤ ∖ ℤ⁻ ∖ {0}
- ℤ⁻  Non-negative integers, ℤ ∖ ℕ
- ℤ∖ ℕ
      ℤᐩ
      ℤ ∖ ℕ ∖ {0}
      ±n
      -1⋅n

- ℚ   Rational numbers
- ℝ   Real numbers
- ℝ∖ℚ Irrational numbers

- ℂ   Complex numbers
- ℂ∖ℝ Imaginary numbers
      complex number, `a + bi`, a,b ∈ ℝ 
      𝓲 = √-1
      𝒾² = -1
      complex conjugate

- 𝒫(ℝ)
- ℙ primes
- 𝔸 algebraic numbers
- ℍ
- ℂ = ℝ ∪ 𝕀

Countable set of ℵ₀ cardinality
- ℕ : card(ℕ) = ℵ₀
- ℤ : card(ℤ) = ℵ₀
- ℚ : card(ℚ) = ℵ₀

Uncountable sets:
- 𝒫(ℕ): card(𝒫(ℕ)) = card(ℝ) = 𝔠
- ℝ:    card(ℝ) = 𝔠
