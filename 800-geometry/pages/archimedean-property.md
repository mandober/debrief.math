# Archimedean property

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property

In abstract algebra and analysis, the Archimedean property, named after the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse, is a property held by some algebraic structures, such as ordered or normed groups, and fields.

The **Archimedean property** states that given two positive numbers x and y, there is an integer n such that n∙x > y, i.e. `x,y ∈ ℕ, n ∈ ℤ, nx > y`.

>Archimedean property implies that ℕ is not bounded from above.

## Geometry over a non-Archimedean ordered field

The first sense of the term is as the geometry over a non-Archimedean ordered field or its subset.

The aforementioned Dehn plane takes the self-product of the finite portion of a certain non-Archimedean ordered field based on the field of rational functions.

In this geometry, there are significant differences from Euclidean geometry; in particular, there are *infinitely many parallels to a straight line* through a point - so the parallel postulate fails - but the sum of the angles of a triangle is still 180°.

Intuitively, in such a space, the points on a line cannot be described by the real numbers or a subset of reals, and there exist segments of "infinite" or "infinitesimal" length.

## Geometry over a non-Archimedean valued field

The second sense of the term is the metric geometry over a non-Archimedean valued field, or ultrametric space.

In *ultrametric space*, even more contradictions to Euclidean geometry arise. For example, all triangles are isosceles, and overlapping balls nest. An example of such a space is the *p-adic numbers*.

Intuitively, in such a space, distances fail to "add up" or "accumulate".
