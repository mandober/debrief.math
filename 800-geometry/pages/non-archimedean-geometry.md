# Non-Archimedean geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Archimedean_geometry

**Non-Archimedean geometry** is any of a number of forms of geometry in which *the axiom of Archimedes* is negated.

An example of such a geometry is the *Dehn plane*. Non-Archimedean geometries may, as the example indicates, have properties significantly different from Euclidean geometry.

There are two senses in which the term may be used, referring to geometries over fields which violate one of the two senses of the Archimedean property (i.e. with respect to order or magnitude).
