# Geometry :: Euclidean geometry :: Point

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)



In classical Euclidean geometry, a **point** is a primitive notion that models an exact location in space.

A point has no length, width, or thickness - it is dimensionless. A point is the only geometric element of the dimension zero. Dimension one contains lines, rays, line segments.

In modern mathematics, a point more generally refers to an element of some set, called a *space*. A space contains an infinite number of points, but so does a circle, a square, a line, a ray, a line segment, etc. 


Being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a point is defined only by some properties, called axioms, that it must satisfy; for example, "there is exactly one line that passes through two different points".
