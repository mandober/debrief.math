# Geometry :: Euclidean geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry

**Euclidean geometry** is a mathematical system attributed to ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry, "Elements". Euclid's approach consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing axioms (postulates) and deducing many other propositions (theorems) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated earlier, Euclid was the first to organize these propositions into a logical system in which each result is proved from axioms and previously proved theorems.

Much of the "Elements" states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in a geometrical language. The "Elements" begins with plane geometry, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of mathematical proofs. It proceeds to the geometry of (3D) solids.

For more than 2000 years, the adjective "Euclidean" was unnecessary because no other form of geometry was known. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the *parallel postulate*) that theorems proved from them were deemed absolutely true. Then, beginning with the early 19th century, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries were discovered.

An implication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and *Euclidean space* is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the gravitational field).

Euclidean geometry is an example of *synthetic geometry*, in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects, such as points and lines, than procceds to describe propositions about those objects. This is contrasted by *analytic geometry*, introduced almost 2000 years later by Ren√© Descartes, which uses *coordinates* to express geometric properties by means of algebraic formulas.
