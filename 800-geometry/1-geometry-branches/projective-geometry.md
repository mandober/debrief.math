# Projective geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry

In mathematics, projective geometry is the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations.

This means that, compared to elementary Euclidean geometry, projective geometry has a different setting (projective space) and a selective set of basic geometric concepts.

The basic intuitions are that projective space has more points than Euclidean space, for a given dimension, and that geometric transformations are permitted that transform the extra points (called "points at infinity") to Euclidean points, and vice versa.
