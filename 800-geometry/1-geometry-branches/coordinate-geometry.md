**Coordinate geometry** is the study of geometric figures by plotting them in the coordinate axes. Figures such as straight lines, curves, circles, ellipse, hyperbola, polygons, can be easily drawn and presented to scale in the coordinate axes.

Analytic geometry, aka *coordinate geometry* or *Cartesian geometry*, is the study of geometry using a coordinate system. This contrasts with synthetic geometry.
