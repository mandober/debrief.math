# Hyperbolic geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry

In mathematics, hyperbolic geometry (also called Lobachevskian geometry or Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry) is a non-Euclidean geometry.

The parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced with:

For any given line R and point P not on R, in the plane containing both line R and point P there are at least two distinct lines through P that do not intersect R.

Compare the above with *Playfair's axiom*, the modern version of Euclid's parallel postulate.
