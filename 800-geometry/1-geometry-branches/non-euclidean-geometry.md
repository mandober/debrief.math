In the middle part of the XIX century, mathematicians first realized that there were different kinds of geometric systems that did not obey Euclid's axioms of plane geometry.

The idea that there could be geometries of higher dimensions was controversial to philosophers of the time subscribed to a "realistic" view of geometry, but not nearly as much as the idea that there could be different kinds of 2D geometry.
