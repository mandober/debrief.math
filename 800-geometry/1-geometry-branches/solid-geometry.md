# Solid geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_geometry

Solid geometry or *stereometry* is the geometry of 3D Euclidean space (3D space).

A solid figure is the region of 3D space bounded by a 2D closed surface; e.g. a solid ball consists of a sphere and its interior.

Solid geometry deals with the measurements of volumes of various solids, including pyramids, prisms (and other polyhedrons), cubes, cylinders, cones (and truncated cones).
