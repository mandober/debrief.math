# Elliptic geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_geometry

Elliptic geometry is an example of a geometry in which Euclid's parallel postulate does not hold.

Instead, as in spherical geometry, there are no parallel lines since any two lines must intersect.

However, unlike in spherical geometry, two lines are usually assumed to intersect at a single point (rather than two). Because of this, the elliptic geometry described in this article is sometimes referred to as *single elliptic geometry* whereas spherical geometry is sometimes referred to as *double elliptic geometry*.
