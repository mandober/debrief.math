*Geometry* is a branch of mathematics concerned with properties of space such as distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures.

Kinds of geometries
- Euclidean geometry
- Euclid's parallel postulate (Euclid's fifth postulate)
- Non-Euclidean geometry
- Gaussian curvature
- Gauss' Theorema Egregium
- Riemannian geometry
- geometry that underlies general relativity

Properties of space
- distance
- shape of space
- size of space
- surface
- relative positions of figures within space
- specific embedding in a Euclidean space
- theory of manifolds
- Riemannian geometry


The word "geometry" comes from Ancient Greek `γεωμετρία` (geōmetría) 'land measurement'; from `γῆ` (gê) 'earth, land', and `μέτρον` (métron) 'a measure'.

A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a *geometer*.

Geometry is, along with arithmetic, one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Until the XIX century, the only kind of geometry was *Euclidean geometry*, which, as fundamental concepts, includes the notions of point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, curve.

Originally developed to model the physical world, geometry has applications in almost all sciences, and also in art, architecture, and other activities related to graphics.

Geometry also has applications in areas of mathematics that are apparently unrelated. For example, methods of *algebraic geometry* are fundamental in Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic (`aˣ + bˣ = cˣ` for x > 2), and remained unsolved for several centuries until the XX century (BTW, x=1 is trivial, many cases exist for x=2 aka Pythagorean triples; but the question was whether three is x > 2 as a solution. Wiles proved there's no such x).

During the XIX century several discoveries have dramatically enlarged the scope of math and geometry. One of the oldest ones was Carl Friedrich Gauss' *Theorema Egregium* ("remarkable theorem"), which roughly asserts that the *Gaussian curvature* of a surface is independent from any specific embedding in a Euclidean space. This implies that surfaces can be studied intrinsically, that is, as stand-alone spaces, and has been expanded into the *theory of manifolds* and *Riemannian geometry*.

Later in the XIX century, it appeared that geometries without *the parallel postulate* (aka non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies *general relativity* is a famous application of *non-Euclidean geometry*.

Since late XIX century, the scope of geometry has been expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that *depend on the underlying methods*, like 
- differential geometry
- algebraic geometry
- computational geometry
- algebraic topology
- discrete geometry, aka combinatorial geometry
- etc.

or, on the *disregarded properties of Euclidean spaces*, yielding
- projective geometry: considers only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism
- affine geometry: omits the concept of angle and distance
- finite geometry: omits continuity
- etc.

This enlargement of the scope of geometry led to the change of the meaning of the word "space": originally it referred to the 3D space of the physical world and its model provided by Euclidean geometry; presently a *geometric space*, or just space, is a mathematical structure on which some geometry is defined.
