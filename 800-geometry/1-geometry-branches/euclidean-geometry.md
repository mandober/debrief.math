# Geometry :: Euclidean geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry

**Euclidean geometry** is a mathematical system attributed to ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, which he described in his textbook on geometry, "Elements".

Euclid's approach to geometry consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing facts (axioms, postulates) and deducing other propositions (theorems) from these. In fact, Euclid calls "postulates" those familiar, general, intuitively appealing facts (most outside geometry; e.g. about equality), while the term "axiom" is reserved for declarations he postulates (about geometry). Aside from these, Euclid also introduces a number of objects and concepts as primitives. It is pretty much like any modern theory, although at Euclid's time the postulates were supposed to be intuitive facts that anyone would acknowedge. Today, postulate and axiom are synonyms, and refer to a set of statements the author of the theory is free to make without worrying whether they are evident and intuitive. However, if one accepts them, then they must also accept the theory that follow. In short, we do not stop to justify the assumptions the theory makes, but proceed to present the theory, making it a conditional construct (if the assumptions hold, then the theory must hold).

Although many of Euclid's results had been stated earlier, Euclid was the first to organize these propositions into a logical system in which each result is proved from axioms and previously proved theorems.

Much of the "Elements" states results of what are now called algebra and number theory, explained in a geometrical language. The "Elements" begins with *plane geometry*, still taught in secondary school (high school) as the first axiomatic system and the first examples of mathematical proofs. It proceeds to the geometry of (3D) solids.

For more than 2000 years, the adjective "Euclidean" was unnecessary because no other form of geometry was known. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the *parallel postulate*) that theorems proved from them were deemed absolutely true. Then, beginning with the early 19th century, many other self-consistent non-Euclidean geometries were discovered.

An implication of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and *Euclidean space* is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the gravitational field).

Euclidean geometry is an example of *synthetic geometry*, in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects, such as points and lines, than proceeds to describe propositions about those objects.

This is contrasted by *analytic geometry*, introduced almost 2000 years later, by Ren√© Descartes, which uses *coordinates* to express geometric properties by means of algebraic formulas.

As *Euclidean geometry* lies at the intersection of *metric geometry* and *affine geometry*, *non-Euclidean geometry* arises by either replacing the parallel postulate with an alternative, or relaxing the metric requirement.
