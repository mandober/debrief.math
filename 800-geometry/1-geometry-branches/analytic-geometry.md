# Analytic geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry

- Analytic geometry studies:
  - defining and representing geometric shapes in numerical way
  - extracting numerical information from these objects
  - linear continuum of geometry
  - Cantor-Dedekind axioms

**Analytic geometry** (aka **coordinate geometry**, **Cartesian geometry**), is the study of geometric objects using a *coordinate system*, as opposed to *synthetic geometry* which derives propositions about geometric shapes starting from a set of axioms.

Analytic geometry is used in physics and engineering, and also in aviation, rocketry, space science, and spaceflight. It is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry, including
- algebraic geometry
- differential geometry
- discrete geometry
- computational geometry

Usually the *Cartesian coordinate system* is applied to manipulate equations for planes, straight lines, and circles, in 2 and 3 dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the *Euclidean plane* (2D) and *Euclidean space* (3D).

>Analytic geometry is concerned with defining and representing geometric shapes in a numerical way, and extracting numerical information from the numerical definitions and representations of these shapes.

That the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the *linear continuum* of geometry relies on the *Cantor-Dedekind axiom*.
