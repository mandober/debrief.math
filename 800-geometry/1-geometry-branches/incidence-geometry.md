# Incidence geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry

In mathematics, incidence geometry is the study of *incidence structures*.

A geometric structure such as the Euclidean plane is a complicated object that involves concepts such as length, angles, continuity, betweenness, and incidence.

An *incidence structure* is what is obtained when all other concepts are removed and all that remains is the data about which points lie on which lines.

Even with this severe limitation, theorems can be proved and interesting facts emerge concerning this structure. 

Such fundamental results remain valid when additional concepts are added to form a richer geometry.

It sometimes happens that authors blur the distinction between a study and the objects of that study, so it is not surprising to find that some authors refer to incidence structures as incidence geometries.
