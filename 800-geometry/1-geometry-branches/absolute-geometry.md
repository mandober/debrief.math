# Absolute geometry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_geometry

**Absolute geometry** is a geometry based on an axiom system for *Euclidean geometry* without the parallel postulate or any of its alternatives. Traditionally, this has meant using only the first four of Euclid's postulates.

The term was introduced by JÃ¡nos Bolyai in 1832. It is sometimes referred to as **neutral geometry**, as it is neutral with respect to the parallel postulate.

The first four of Euclid's postulates are now considered insufficient as a basis of Euclidean geometry, so other systems (such as Hilbert's axioms without the parallel axiom) are used instead.
