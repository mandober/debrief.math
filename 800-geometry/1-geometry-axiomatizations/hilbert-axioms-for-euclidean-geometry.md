Hilbert's axioms are a set of 20 assumptions proposed by David Hilbert in 1899 in his book "Grundlagen der Geometrie" (The Foundations of Geometry) as the foundation for a modern treatment of Euclidean geometry.

Other well-known modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry are those of Alfred Tarski and of George Birkhoff.
