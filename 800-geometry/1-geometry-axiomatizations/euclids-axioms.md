## Euclid

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid

Euclid /ˈjuːklɪd/ (Εὐκλείδης Eukleidos) was an ancient Greek mathematician, geometer and logician active around  300 BCE.

It is now generally accepted that Euclid spent his career in Alexandria, being active around the year 300 BCE, after Plato's students and before Archimedes. Euclid is regarded as bridging the earlier Platonic tradition in Athens with the later tradition of Alexandria.

Euclid is considered the "father of geometry" due to his treatise "Elements", which established the foundations of geometry and dominated the field until the early 19th century, at which time other system of geometry were discovered. The Euclid's system, until then known simply as geometry, became Euclidean geometry as non-Euclidean geometries were revealed. Euclidean geometry involved innovations in combination with a synthesis of theories from earlier Greek mathematicians, and it was a part of syllabus for the next two millenia. Along Archimedes and Apollonius of Perga, Euclid is generally considered among the greatest mathematicians of antiquity, and one of the most influential in the history of mathematics.

For well over 2000 years, people had believed that only one geometry was possible, and they had accepted the idea that this geometry described reality.

One of the greatest Greek achievements was setting up rules for plane geometry.

Euclid has set up a system of rules for plane geometry. His system was a collection of undefined terms (primitives), such as point and line, a set of postulates (general truths), and a set of 5 axioms. From this base, Euclid then proceeded to derive propositions about geometry in a logically consistent way. The first four axioms were intuitive, self-evident facts that no one questioned, but the famous fifth axiom was a different sort of statement:

1. A straight line may be drawn between any two points.
2. A straight line may be extended indefinitely.
3. A circle of any radius may be drawn centered at any point.
4. All right angles are equal (all 90ᵒ angles are the same).
5. If two straight lines in a plane are met by another line, and if the sum of the internal angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the straight lines will meet if extended sufficiently on the side on which the sum of the angles is less than two right angles.

It was an axiom about parallel lines

Because this axiom was much more complicated than the previous axioms, it seemed more like a theorem than a self-evident proposition. Since all attempts to deduce it from the first four axioms had failed, Euclid simply included it as an axiom because he knew he needed it. For example, some axiom like this one was necessary for proving one of Euclid's most famous theorems, that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Mathematicians found alternate forms of the axiom that were easier to state, for example:

5'. For any given point not on a given line, there is exactly one line through the point that does not meet the given line.

This form of the fifth axiom became known as the parallel postulate. Although it was simpler to understand than Euclid's original formulation, it was no easier to deduce from the earlier axioms. The attempt to deduce the fifth axiom remained a great challenge right up to the nineteenth century, when it was proved that the fifth axiom did not follow from the first four.

The great advantage of expressing geometry as an axiomatic system was that it no longer was necessary to memorize long lists of independent facts about the nature of the universe--one only had to know a small set of axioms, and by applying to them the rules of inference, one could reconstruct the entire collection of geometric truths.

There was little doubt that the Greeks were attempting to describe a real world when they formulated their geometry, even though it might have been an ideal sort of world, realized only abstractly "in the mind of God." Many mathematicians, now as well as in the distant past, believe that the complete structure of mathematics is something that exists in itself and that it is only gradually discovered by human beings laboring to uncover its mysteries. Even though the framers of the early axiom systems would refer to point and line as undefined terms, they fairly clearly thought of them as real objects, and they thought that the system they were developing was a progressively more and more elaborate and accurate description of the real world. The progress of algebra, on the other hand, was not quite so settled, and people accepted changes in viewpoint there more readily than in the very traditional field of geometry.
