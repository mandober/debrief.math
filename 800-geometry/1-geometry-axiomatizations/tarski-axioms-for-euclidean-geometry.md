*Tarski's axioms for Euclidean geometry* is a set of axioms specifically targeting the portion of Euclidean geometry that can be formalized as an elementary theory (formalizable in FOL with identity w/o sets). As such, it does not require an underlying set theory.

Primitives (undefined terms)
- *point*
- *betweenness* (primitive predicate) expressing the fact that a point lies on a line segment between two other points
- *congruence* (primitive predicate) expressing the fact that the distance between two points equals the distance between two other points

The system contains infinitely many axioms as it uses axiom schemata.

Using his axiom system, Tarski was able to show that the first-order theory of Euclidean geometry is consistent, complete and decidable: every sentence in its language is either provable or disprovable from the axioms, and we have an algorithm which decides for any given sentence whether it is provable or not.
