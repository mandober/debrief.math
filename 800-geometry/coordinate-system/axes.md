# Axes

- an axis is a fixed reference line for the measurement of coordinates
- an axis (pl. axes) is an imaginary line about which an object rotates

- x-axis is the horizontal axis
- y-axis as the vertical axis

Geometry
- an imaginary straight line passing through the centre of a symmetrical solid, about which a plane figure can be conceived as rotating to generate the solid.
- an imaginary line which divides something into equal or roughly equal halves, especially in the direction of its greatest length.

Math
- a fixed reference line for the measurement of coordinates.
- A specific line (often a directed line) that plays an important role in some contexts. In particular: Coordinate axis of a coordinate system. x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, common names for the coordinate axes of a Cartesian coordinate system.
- An axis in mathematics is defined as a line that is used to make or mark measurements. The x and y-axis are two important lines of the coordinate plane. The x-axis is a horizontal number line and the y-axis is a vertical number line. These two axes intersect perpendicularly to form the coordinate plane.
- The point where the axes meet is called the origin and has (0, 0) as coordinates. The axes directions represent an orthogonal basis. The combination of origin and basis forms a coordinate frame called the Cartesian frame. Illustration of a Cartesian coordinate plane.
