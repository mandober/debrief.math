Coordinate system
- Cartesian Coordinate system
  - Cartesian coordinates
    - origin point at (0, 0)
    - two axes: x-axis (horizontal) and y-axis (vertical)
    - units, measure, ticks, tick offset
    - length between ticks depends on granularity, there is no measure for ℝ²
    - measures (length between ticks):
      - uniform: equal offset on both axes
      - proportional measures, x:y offset ratio (1:2, 2:1, etc.)
      - non-proportional, axes have independent measures
  - 2D Cartesian Coordinate system
    - 2D Cartesian coordinates, (x, y)
    - point (x, y)
    - granularity: ℕ → ℕ
    - granularity: ℕ → ℝ
    - granularity: ℝ → ℝ
  - 3D Cartesian Coordinate system
    - point (x, y, z)
    - granularity: ℕ² → ℕ
    - granularity: ℕ² → ℝ
    - granularity: ℝ² → ℝ
  - Higher-dimensional Cartesian Coordinate system
    - point (d₀, d₁, d₂, d₃, …)
- Polar coordinate system
  - Polar coordinates



## Cartesian coordinate system

Cartesian coordinate system usually pertains to a two- or three-dimensional dimensional Euclidean (flat) plane. 2D plane is the default that can be extended by additional dimensions. The two dimensions are usually labelled as `x` and `y`, realized as the horizontal *x-axis* and the vertical *y-axis* that meet an the right angle at a point called *origin* labelled (0, 0). Both axes are *number lines*, and the numbers on them are called *coordinates* in this context. So we have x-coordinates and y-coordinates. Any point on 2D plane can be identified by pair of x- and y-coordinate, packed together as an ordered pair, `(x, y)`.
