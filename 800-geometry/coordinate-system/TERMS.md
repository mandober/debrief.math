  - number line
  - projection (of a point onto the axes)
  - origin, (0, 0)
  - axes
    - directed line
    - orthogonal lines
    - x-axis
    - horizontal axis

polar coordinate system
polar grid
angle `θ` and distance `r` from the pole, `(r, θ)`
`x = rcosθ`
`y = rsinθ`
`θ = arctan(y/x)`
`r = √(x² + y²)`
converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates
converting from polar to Cartesian coordinates
polar equations
polar functions (?)
parametric equations
parametric functions (?)
derivatives of polar equations
polar curves
periodic polar curves
Polar inequalities
polar equations must be linear in `r`
currently not possible to plot polar equations of the form `θ = f(r)`
