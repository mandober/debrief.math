# Coordinate system

There are many coordinate systems, but our primary interest is now in the *two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system* identified by two lines, in this context called *axes*, that intersect at the right angle. The point of their intersection is called *origin* and identified by (0, 0).

These identifiers, generically denoted by `(x, y)`, are called *coordinate points*. Any any point in the coordinate plane can be identified by them. A coordinate point is an *ordered pair* consisting of two components.

The first component of the order pair `(x, y)` is always a value on the horizontal x-axis, called *x-coordinate*.

The second component of the order pair `(x, y)` is always a value on the vertical y-axis, called *y-coordinate*.

On th other hand, given a point `P` in the coordinate plane, we can determine its coordinates, `(xᴾ, yᴾ)`, by *projecting* the point onto the axes. The x-coordinate of the point can be determined by drawing a line from the point so it intersects the x-axis at the right angle. The y-coordinate is determined by projecting the point onto the y-axis. Both projection lines are orthogonal to their respective axes.

Each axis is actually a *number line*, and the two axes may represent different sets of numbers. Most of the time, both axis represent the same set of numbers, typically the set of the real numbers `ℝ`, with the coordinate plane being their cartesian product, `ℝ×ℝ` or `ℝ²`.

In general, axes may have different underlying number set. Moreover, the ratio of ticks may differ between the two axes. A *tick* is the relative distance between the subsequent integer values on the same axis. This *ratio* may be set differently for each axes, especially if values of one dimension are significantly sparser compared to the other.


**Cartesian product** between two sets `A` and `B` is denoted `A×B`, and the Cartesian product on a single set `A` is denoted `A×A` or `A²`. Cartesian product is also a set, but unlike the other usual sets which contain numbers (objects) directly, its elements are actually pairs of numbers (objects), called *ordered pairs*.

    A×B = { (x, y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B }

These ordered pairs are the same ones that make up coordinate points. However, there are various coordinate points depending on their role or origin. For one, the coordinate plane itself consists of coordinate points. Its elements are the coordinate points of the form `(x, y)`, where, typically, both `x,y ∈ ℝ`.

The 2D Cartesian coordinate system is often used for drawing various geometric shapes. This is called *plotting*, and the process involves transforming the points that make up a shape into coordinate points. For our purposes here, we are primarily interested in plotting the graphs of common functions.

The resulting shape of plotting a function is called a *graph* (additionally overloading this term). However, the scope of this term was broadened so now it may refer to any shape plotted in the coordinate plane, whether originating from plotting a function or not. Functions, however, are not the only algebraic entity that can be represented as a graph. *Polynomials* are more general  equations that also enjoy this property. 

Another sense of the term "graph" is the *graph of a function*. Namely, any function is only completely defined 



In the most narrow sense this term should only be used when referring the resulting plots of functions, but the use of the term "graph" has spread beyond this.


this term should only be used for the shapes resulting from plotting functions, but

Drawing a geomteric shape in a coordinate system is calle *plotting*



plot geomteric objects such as points (the most primitive)

*Point* is the most primitive geometric object. It is undefined so it must be introduced via an axiom. Point is a dimensionless object - it is the only such object so it lives alone in 0D 

(it is the only object without dimensions). 


is to draw and identify and drawing of shapes
The purpose of 


, i.e. a set of ordered pairs X×Y


The coordinate plane itself is a set of coordinate points (the coordinate plane is the Cartesian product so its elements are )





When the density relation (density of values) of axis are very different, the axis may take on a different set of numbers, such that, e.g. x-axis is ℤ, while y-axis is ℝ, in which case the coordinate plane is ℤ×ℝ.

The case when the coordinate plane is `ℝ×ℂ` is special.




Various (geometric) shapes can be drawn in the coordinate plane by plotting their constituent points as coordinate points
