# Geometry :: Coordinate system

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system



In geometry, a **coordinate system** is a system that uses one or more numbers, called *coordinates*, to uniquely determine the position of *geometric elements* (points, vectors, shapes) on a *manifold* (e.g. Euclidean space).

>In geometry, a **coordinate system** is a system that uses a set of numbers, called **coordinates**, to uniquely specify the position of geometric elements on a manifold.


The order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in a tuple, and sometimes by a letter (e.g. x-coordinate).

The coordinates are taken to be real numbers in elementary mathematics, but may be complex numbers, or elements of a more abstract system such as a commutative ring.

The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and vice versa; this is the basis of *analytic geometry*.
