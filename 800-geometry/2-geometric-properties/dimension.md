# Dimension

Dimension is also a property of geomteric shapes, although it more seems that it is the environment in which they live in.

Dimensions
- 0D (point)
- 1D (line, line segment, ray)
- 2D (circle, square, triangle)
- 3D (sphere, cube, pyramidᐩ)
- 4D (hypersphere, hypersquare, …)
- higher-dimensions

(ᐩ) there are in fact various pyramidal shapes in 3D, the simplest being a pyramid with a triangle as base, after which the progression of 2D geometric shapes with increasing sides ensues, culminating with a circle.

We can't really imagine 4D let alone higher dimensions.
