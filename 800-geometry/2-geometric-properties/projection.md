# Projection

**3D projection**, or **graphical projection**, is a *design technique* used to display a 3D object on a 2D surface. These projections rely on *visual perspective* and *aspect analysis* to project a complex object for viewing capability on a simpler plane.

## Perspective

**Linear perspective** or **point-projection perspective** (from Latin "perspicere" meaning "to see through") is one of two types of *graphical projection perspective* in the graphic arts; the other is *parallel projection*. Linear perspective is an approximate representation, generally on a flat surface, of an image as it is seen by the eye. Perspective drawing is useful for representing a 3D scene in a 2D medium, like paper. It is based on the optical fact that for a person an object looks N times (linearly) smaller if it has been moved N times further from the eye compared to the original distance. The most characteristic features of linear perspective are that objects appear smaller as their distance from the observer increases, and that they are subject to *foreshortening*, meaning that an object's dimensions parallel to the line of sight appear shorter than its dimensions perpendicular to the line of sight. All objects will recede to points in the distance, usually along the horizon line, but also above and below the horizon line depending on the view used.
