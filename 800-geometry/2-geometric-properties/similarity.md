# Similarity

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)

In Euclidean geometry, two objects are similar if they have the same shape, or if one has the same shape as the mirror image of the other.

More precisely, one can be obtained from the other by uniformly *scaling* (enlarging or reducing), possibly with additional *translation*, *rotation* and *reflection*.

This means that either object can be rescaled, repositioned, and reflected, so as to coincide precisely with the other object.

If two objects are similar, each is *congruent* to the result of a particular uniform scaling of the other.
