# Curvature

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature

Curvature is any of several strongly related concepts in geometry that intuitively measure the amount by which a curve deviates from being a straight line or by which a surface deviates from being a plane.

If a curve or surface is contained in a larger space, curvature can be defined extrinsically relative to the ambient space.

Curvature of *Riemannian manifolds* of dimension at least two can be defined intrinsically without reference to a larger space.
