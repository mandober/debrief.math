# Incidence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry)

In geometry, an *incidence relation* is a heterogeneous relation that captures the idea being expressed when phrases such as "a point lies on a line" or "a line is contained in a plane" are used.

The most basic incidence relation is that between a point, `P`, and a line, `l`, sometimes denoted `P I l`. If `P` and `l` are incident, `P I l`, the pair `(P, l)` is called a *flag*.
