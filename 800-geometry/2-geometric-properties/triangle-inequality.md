# Triangle inequality

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality

>The triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.

This statement permits the inclusion of degenerate triangles, but some authors, especially those writing about elementary geometry, will exclude this possibility, thus leaving out the possibility of equality.

If a, b, c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle then the triangle inequality states that `c â‰¤ a + b`, with equality only in the degenerate case of a triangle with zero area.
