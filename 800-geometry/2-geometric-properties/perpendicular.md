# Perpendicular

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular

In geometry, two geometric objects are perpendicular if they intersect at right angles, i.e. at an angle of 90ᵒ or π/2 radians.

The condition of perpendicularity may be represented graphically using the perpendicular symbol, `⟂`.

Perpendicular intersections can happen between two lines (or two line segments), between a line and a plane, and between two planes.
