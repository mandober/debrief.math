# About coordinate systems

There are numerous kinds of coordinate systems, and even within the same type of a coordinate system, there are varieties and divisions based on multiple criteria with a constant factor being the number of dimensions.

In Euclidean geometry, the most used coordinate system is probably the Cartesian which comes in two popular varieties: the first is also called Cartesian and it expresses the location of a point by an n-tuple of numbers, where the tuple's arity, `n`, corresponds to the number of dimensions; n=2, and then n=3, are the most popular. This is the system perfect for expressing the accumulated knowledge of geometry during almost 2 millenia, when geometry didn't need to be qualified - there was only Euclidean. 

Even sticking to two-dimensional space (n=2, i.e. 2D space) requires a lot of time and effort to investigate thouroughly, and also provides the base for more advanced coordinate systems and geometries. Thus, by default, we are almost always inside the Euclidean or Cartesian 2D plane, using the *rectangular* 2D Cartesian coordinate system, only occasionally flirting with the polar coordinates.
