# Even and odd functions

- even: f(-x) = f(x)
- odd: f(-x) = -f(x)

Any function defined on a domain which is symmetric about 0 - which means that if `x ∈ dom(f)` then `−x ∈ dom(f)` for each `x ∈ dom(f)` - can be written as a sum of an even function and an odd function.

```js
       f(x) + f(-x)    f(x) - f(-x)
f(x) = ------------- + ------------
            2               2
```
