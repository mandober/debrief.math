# Calculus :: Functions, graphs and curves

Calculus deals with change, but this change is so small it is described by extremely small numbers which are very close to, but never include, zero.

These numbers, also known as *infinitesimals*, have arisen from the efforts to understood the consequence of small varying changes, best exemplified as an attempt to define the tangent line for a given point on a curve. This is a difficult task since two points are generally required to define a line.




to define a tangent line (or any line in general) when all you have is a single point.

A secant line is easily defined since it intersects a curve at two points, but a tangent line has only a single point in common with a curve. 


However, it turned out it can be done with the help of secant lines. The point on a curve for which we want to find the tangent line, `P`, becomes a fixed point for secant lines. We can draw a secant line that intersects the curve at `P` and another arbitrary point. Then we can draw another secant line, with one vertex always at `P`, and the other vertex closer `P`.

By considering the input values of some function `f(x)` as the *x-coordinates*, and the corresponding output values as *y-coordinates*, we can obtain a set of `(x, y)` coordinates that may be plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system to produce a curve of a specific shape, called the *graph of function*.

Strictly, the graph of the function `f(x)`, with type `f : A → B`, is the set of ordered pairs (as input-output values), `f = {(x,y) | x ∈ A, y ∈ B, f(x)=y}`, and the plotted curve is the graph manifest. The graph of a function is just one, albeit the most considered element of a function's definition, which is actually a triplet `(A, f, B)`, where `A` is the domain set of the function, `B` is the codomain set, and `f` is the function's graph.

So the function's graph is a set `{ (x, y) }`, consisting of all the input-output pairs of the function that describe its graph as a curve, but, actually, any point in the coordinate system is desribed by a pair of coordinates `(x, y)`.

Another thing is that any x-coordinate alone, as long as that `x` is an element of the function's domain set, is sufficient to find out the unique point on the curve as determined by `x`: we can plug this `x` into the function to get the corresponding y-coordinate as the function's output value, `y`. 

A function's curve is described by a set of `(x, y)` pairs (these are its input-output values as a set of ordered pairs) and all the `x`'s in this set are unique! If they weren't unique, it wouldn't be a function.


the point `P` is defined by a pair of coordinates `(x₀, y₀)`.
