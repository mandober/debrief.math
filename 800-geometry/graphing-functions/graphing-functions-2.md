# Graphing functions

- vertical line test checks if a curve is a fn
- horizontal line test checks if a curve is an injection
- a function has 0 or 1 y-intercept
- a function may have many x-intercepts (sin has ∞ of x-intercepts)
- x-intercepts are zeros of a function (polynomial)
- polynomials may be functions
- functions: constant, linear, quadratic, quartic, …
- line equations are functions
- line equation must have an x- and y-intercept (unless H/V line)
- horizontal line, y = k, is a function without the x-intercept
- unless k=0 (so y=0), in which case it has ∞ of x-intercepts
- vertical line, x = k, has undefined slope and is not a function
- some (implicit) equations are implicit functions
- not all equations are functions
- determine points of interest: intercepts
- determine critical points:
  - local and global minima
  - local and global maxima
  - inflection points
- even, odd, neither even nor odd functions
  - even:    `f(-x) =  f(x)`; x² as f(-2) = f(2)
  - odd:     `f(-x) = -f(x)`; x³ as f(-2) = -f(2)
  - neither: `f(-x) ≠ -f(x)` nor `f(-x) ≠ f(x)`
- determine domain and range of the function
- piecewise functions
- continuity
- differentiability
- monotonicity: increasing or decreasing
- first derivative test: monotonicity
- second derivative test: concavity
- limit of a function
- increasing, decreasing and constant functions
