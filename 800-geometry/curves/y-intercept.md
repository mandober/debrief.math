# y-intercept

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-intercept

In analytic geometry, using the common convention that the horizontal axis represents a variable `x` and the vertical axis represents a variable `y`, a *y-intercept* or *vertical intercept* is a point where the graph of a function or relation intersects the y-axis of the coordinate system. As such, these points satisfy `x = 0`.


- to find y-intercept of a function, eval it at f(0)
- y-intercept has coordinates (0, f 0)
- functions have at most one y-intercept
- functions may have more then 1 x-intercept
- functions undefined at x=0 have no y-intercept
- lines parallel to y-axis (x=b) have no y-intercept, 
- that is, vertical lines have undefined slope


## Using equations

If the curve in question is given as `y = f(x)`, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept (x-coordinate is 0) is found by calculating `f(0)`.

>y-intercept has coordinates `(0, f 0)`.

Functions which are undefined at `x = 0` have no y-intercept.

If a fn is linear and expressed in *slope-intercept form* as `f(x) = a + bx`, the constant term `a` is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept. In the more common form of the slope-intercept equation, `y = mx + b`, y-intercept is `b`.



## Multiple y-intercepts

Some 2-dimensional mathematical relationships such as circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas can have more than one y-intercept. Because functions associate x-values to no more than one y-value as part of their definition, they can have at most one y-intercept.

Analogously, an x-intercept is a point where the graph of a function or relation intersects with the x-axis. As such, these points satisfy `y=0`. The zeros, or roots, of such a function or relation are the x-coordinates of these x-intercepts.

Functions of the form `y = f(x)` have at most one y-intercept, but may contain multiple x-intercepts. The x-intercepts of functions, if any exist, are often more difficult to locate than the y-intercept, as finding the y-intercept involves simply evaluating the function at `x=0`.

## In higher dimensions

The notion may be extended for 3-dimensional space and higher dimensions, as well as for other coordinate axes, possibly with other names. For example, one may speak of the *I-intercept* of the current-voltage characteristic of, say, a diode (in electrical engineering, I is the symbol used for electric current).
