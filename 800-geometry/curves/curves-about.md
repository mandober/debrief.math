# About curves

A **curve** is a *graph of a function* or a *plot of an equation* in a coordinate system, usually Cartesian or polar coordinate system.

A graph of the function `f(x) = y` is the set of ordered pairs `(x, y)`, where `x` represents input values and `y` the corresponding output values, i.e. such that `f(x) = y`. Each of these ordered pairs `(x, y)` can be translated into the coordinates of a point in the Cartesian coordinate system. The entire set of the ordered pairs, aka the graph of the function, when plotted consitutes a shape (a curve) defined by the function `f`. 

>A *graph of the function* is both the set of ordered (input/output) pairs of the function, as well as the curve formed by interpreting these pairs as the coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system, then plotting them.

A curve may also result by plotting the `(x, y)` variables of an equation that is an implicit function, or even an equation that is no function at all. For example, the unit circle is defined by an equation that is not a function, `x²+y²=1`, although it may be represented as two related functions with opposite signs, by isolating `y` alone on one side of equation, `y = ±√(1-x²)`, thus defining the upper and lower unit semicircle.

*Elliptic curves*, e.g. `y² = x³ + ax + b`, are currently investigated in relation to cryptography. They are not functions, but again the equation may be split into two functions of opposite signs, `y = ± √(x³ + ax + b)`, defining the upper and lower part of the curve.
