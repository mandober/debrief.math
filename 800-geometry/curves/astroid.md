# Asteroid

- Cartesian equation: `x²′³ + y²′³ = a²′³` 
- or parametrically: `x = a cos³(t), y = a sin³(t)`

The *astroid* was first discussed by Johann Bernoulli in 1691-92. It also appears in Leibniz's correspondence of 1715. It is sometimes called the *tetracuspid* for the obvious reason that it has 4 cusps.

The astroid only acquired its present name in 1836 in a book published in Vienna. It has been known by various names in the literature, even after 1836, including *cubocycloid* and *paracycle*.

The length of the astroid is `6a` and its area is `3πa²/8`.

The gradient of the tangent `T` from the point with parameter `p` is `−tan(p)`. The equation of this tangent `T` is `x sin(p) + y cos(p) = a sin(2p)/2`.

Let `T` cut the x-axis and the y-axis at `X` and `Y` respectively. Then the length `XY` is a constant and is equal to `a`.

It can be formed by rolling a circle of radius `a/4` on the inside of a circle of radius `a`. It can also be formed as the envelope produced when a line segment is moved with each end on one of a pair of perpendicular axes. It is therefore a *glissette*.
