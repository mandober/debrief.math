# Radians

Degree is a common measure of angle. There are 360ᵒ in a circle. In mathematics, it is more convenient to use radian as the unit of angle measure. There are 2π radians in a circle.

>Definition of radian: one radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius of the circle.

`rad` is the unit for radians, but it is often elided as it the default unit for angles.

## Converting between radians and degrees

A half circle is 180ᵒ = π rad. Using the ratio of degrees to radians or radians to degrees in a half circle gives us a scaling factor to convert from radians to degrees or degrees to radians, respectively.
- 180ᵒ/π × 3⁄2π = 270ᵒ
- π/180ᵒ × 270ᵒ = 3⁄2π
- θ rad = π rad/180ᵒ × θᵒ
