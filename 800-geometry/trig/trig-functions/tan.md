# tan

```js
         sin(x)
tan(x) = -------
         cos(x)

            1       sin(x)
tan(x) = ------- = --------
         cot(x)     cos(x)

         ⎛    1   ⎞²      1
tan(x) = ⎜ ------ ⎟ = ---------
         ⎝ cot(x) ⎠    cot²(x)
```



- tan(x) has vertical asymptotes `(2n+1)π/2 where n ∈ ℤ`
  - at (…, -5π/2, -3π/2, -π/2, π/2, 3π/2, 5π/2, …)
  - every `±Nπ/2` where `N=1,3,5,7,…`; if N=2n+1, then every `±(2n+1)π/2, n∈ℤ`
  - `(2n+1)π/2 where n ∈ ℤ`
  - tan lines: (-π/2,π/2)
- every tan line intersects x-axis at 0
- tan(x) has common streches with sin(x) but only every other tan line
  - sin(x) and tan(x) are virtually the same in the interval [-π/16,π/16]
  - sin(x) and tan(x) have no observable difference in interval [-π/24,π/24]
  - about 0, with radius π/16, the matching is excellent
  - but about π it is horrible (with any radius)
  - then excellent again about 2π




- parity: odd
  - tan(-x) = -tan(x)
  - -tan(-x) = tan(x)

```
y =    tan(x)
y =   -tan(x)
y =  1/tan(x)
y = -1/tan(x)
x =    tan(y)
x =   -tan(y)
```
