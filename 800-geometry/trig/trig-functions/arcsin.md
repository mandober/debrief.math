## arcsin notes

The sinus function is:
- `sin(x)`
- `y = sin(x)`
- `f(x) = sin(x)`

The inverse of sinus function means swapping x's and y's:
- `sin⁻¹(x)`
- `x = sin(y)`
- `f⁻¹(y) = arcsin(y)` ≡ `g(y) = arcsin(y)`

If `sin(0.5) = 0.479`, then `arcsin(0.479) = 0.5`.
If `sin(1) = 0.841`, then `arcsin(0.841) = 1`.



Inverse of `y = arcsin(x)` function may be denoted `x = arcsin(y)`. This gives the full inverse of arcsin, not just the slither with the restricted domain. The full inverse of arcsin looks like sin rotated by 90ᵒ.

The `arcsin(x)` is almost the same as a part of the `tan` function that corresponds to arcsin's domain. In the positive direction, [0, π/8] the `tan` and `arcsin` are almost indistinguishable. From π/8 to 



The **inverse of any function** `f(x) = y` is found by swapping `x`'s and `y`'s. So, if `f(a) = b`, then `f⁻¹(b) = a`. However, not all functions have an inverse that is a function. Only bijective functions have proper inverse that is a (bijective) function.

The inverse of the `sin` function can be found by swapping `x`'s and `y`'s (inputs and outputs), but the result is *not a function* anymore. The plot of the inverted `sin` function looks like the graph of `sin` noly rotated by 90ᵒ ccw, which makes it obvious that the vertical test fails.

Even when the inverse of a function is not a function, people often want to squeeze something "inverty" out, and such is the case with `sin`. By restricting the domain of the `arcsin` we pretend it is the inverse of `sin`. Basically, we only allow a slither of the inverted function, which in terms of its graph means it is plotted only in so far it remains a function. 

We take the `sin` function from `-π/2` to `π/2` and invert that to get the `arcsin` function. Note that this interval is not even a complete cycle - it's half a `sin` cycle. One complete `sin` cycle is [-π , π] but we only take half a cycle [-π/2, π/2] and make `arcsin` out of that.
