# Turn

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)

A **turn** is a *unit of plane angle measurement*.

1 turn is equal to
- 2π radians
- 360 degrees
- 400 gradians

Subdivisions of a turn include
- half-turn
- quarter-turn
- centiturn
- milliturn

One turn corresponds to 1 *cycle* or to 1 *revolution*, although those terms may also be used, ambiguously, as shorter version of the units of frequency cycles per second (cps) and revolutions per minute (rpm), respectively.

## Subdivisions

A turn can be divided in 100 centiturns or 1000 milliturns, with each milliturn corresponding to an angle of `0.36°`, which can also be written as `21' 36"`.

A protractor divided in centiturns is normally called a "percentage protractor".

Binary fractions of a turn are also used. Sailors have traditionally divided a turn into 32 compass points, which implicitly have an angular separation of 1/32 turn. The binary degree, also known as the binary radian (or brad), is

 turn.[6] The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be represented to the maximum possible precision in a single byte. Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into 2n equal parts for other values of n.[7]

The notion of turn is commonly used for planar rotations
