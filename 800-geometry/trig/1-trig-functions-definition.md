## Definition of trigonometric functions

- initially defined in terms of a right △ as ratios of its sides
- sides of a right △: hypotenuse, adjacent side, opposite side
- defined cosidering a specific angle in std pos, denoted by `θ`
- the angle θ has the origin point as its vertex
- unit circle allows for signed values of ratios dep on the quadrant
- all trig fns are unary, taking an arg that is a measure of angle θ
- angle θ is given as rad by default, degree must be explicitly annotated
- rad is often in term of fractions or multiples of π


Trigonometric functions were initially defined in terms of a right triangle. However, using a right triangle we can only define positive-valued trig functions. Using the unit circle instead allows for a more general definition.

All trig functions are unary, taking a single argument whose value is interpreted as a measure of an angle in terms of which the trig functions are considered. That angle is traditionally denoted by `θ` and it can only be one of the other two non-right angles of a right triangle. It is in terms of `θ` that the various ratios of the triangle's sides are given.

The default mathematical unit for angles is *radians*, although *degrees* are also used. The angle `θ` is often given in radians, but units are seldom explicitly stated. For example, `θ = 0.785` means `θ = 0.785 rad`, i.e. the angle `θ` is equal to `π/4 rad`, which is about `45ᵒ`. The radian is a very convenient unit because we can state it as a multiple or fraction of π. And `π` is everywhere, especially when considering a circle, like the unit circle that we do. 1 π is 180ᵒ

-   0ᵒ is `0π`   rad or 0     rad
-  15ᵒ is `π/12` rad or 0.262 rad
-  30ᵒ is `π/6`  rad or 0.523 rad
-  45ᵒ is `π/4`  rad or 0.785 rad
-  60ᵒ is `π/3`  rad or 0.047 rad
-  90ᵒ is `π/2`  rad or 1.571 rad
- 180ᵒ is `π`    rad or 3.141 rad
- 270ᵒ is `3π/2` rad or 4.712 rad
- 360ᵒ is `2π`   rad or 6.283 rad
- 540ᵒ is  3π    rad or 9.425 rad

, when it lacks explicit unit notation (e.g. 30ᵒ), it is assumed to be a value in radians. `1 rad` is equal to about `57ᵒ`.
