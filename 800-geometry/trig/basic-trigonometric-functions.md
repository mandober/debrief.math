# Basic trigonometric functions

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Calculus/Trigonometry

Trigonometric functions relate the angle `θ` (θ ≠ 90ᵒ) of a right triangle to the ratios of lengths of its sides.

`θ` is the angle of interest, `a` is the *opposite* side (opposite of θ), `b` is the *adjacent* side (adjacent to θ), and `c` is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle). So a² + b² = c².

The basic trigonometric functions are
- `sin θ = a/c` sine
- `cos θ = b/c` cosine
- `tan θ = a/b` tangent

The other 3 basic functions are the reciprocals of basic functions
- `csc θ = c/a = 1/sin θ` cosecant
- `sec θ = c/b = 1/cos θ` secant
- `cot θ = b/a = 1/tan θ` cotangent

## Properties of trigonometric functions

Fn  | Par | Domain                        | Range                 | Period
----|-----|-------------------------------|-----------------------|--------
sin | odd | ℝ                             | [−1, 1]               | 2π
cos | even| ℝ                             | [−1, 1]               | 2π
tan | odd | x ∈ { n : n ≠ kπ+π/2, k ∈ ℤ } | ℝ                     | π
csc | odd | x ∈ { n : n ≠ kπ,     k ∈ ℤ } | `(−∞, −1]` ∪ `[1, ∞)` | 2π
sec | even| x ∈ { n : n ≠ kπ+π/2, k ∈ ℤ } | `(−∞, −1]` ∪ `[1, ∞)` | 2π
cot | odd | x ∈ { n : n ≠ kπ,     k ∈ ℤ } | ℝ                     | π


However, this definition limits the domains of the trig functions, Since angles in a right triangle only go up to π/2, angles larger than this cannot be defined. For that we need the unit circle.
