# Hyperbolic functions

Functions of the form y = a x + q
Functions of the general form `y = ax + q` are called hyperbolic functions, where `a` and `q` are constants.



The effects of a
 and q
 on f(x)=ax+q
:

The effect of q
 on vertical shift

For q>0
, f(x)
 is shifted vertically upwards by q
 units.

For q<0
, f(x)
 is shifted vertically downwards by q
 units.

The horizontal asymptote is the line y=q
.

The vertical asymptote is the y
-axis, the line x=0
.

The effect of a
 on shape and quadrants

For a>0
, f(x)
 lies in the first and third quadrants.

For a>1
, f(x)
 will be further away from both axes than y=1x
.

For 0<a<1
, as a
 tends to 0
, f(x)
 moves closer to the axes than y=1x
.

For a<0
, f(x)
 lies in the second and fourth quadrants.

For a<−1
, f(x)
 will be further away from both axes than y=−1x
.

For −1<a<0
, as a
 tends to 0
, f(x)
 moves closer to the axes than y=−1x
.
