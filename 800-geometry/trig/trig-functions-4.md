# Trig functions

- unit circle, r = 1
- all radial lines are 1
- pick a point `A` on the circle's arc in the first quadrant
- point `A` has coordinates `(cos Θ, sin Θ)`
- draw a radial line from origin to `A` - it subtends an angle `θ` with x-axis
- `cos² Θ + sin² Θ = 1` (hypotenuse is 1)
- cosinus, cos, line is always horizontal
- sinus line, sin, is always vertical
