# Trigonometric substitution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_substitution

Trigonometric substitution replaces a trigonometric function for another expression.

In calculus, trigonometric substitutions are a technique for evaluating integrals. In this case, an expression involving a radical function is replaced with a trigonometric one. Trigonometric identities may help simplify the answer.

Like other methods of integration by substitution, when evaluating a definite integral, it may be simpler to completely deduce the antiderivative before applying the boundaries of integration.
