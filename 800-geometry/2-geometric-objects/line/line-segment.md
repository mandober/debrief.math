# Geometry :: Line segment

A *line segment* is a part of a line delimited by two points, called the *endpoints*. If there is only one endpoint (i.e. initial point) then it is a ray that starts at the initial point and goes on indefinitely. With no endpoints, we are back to a line that goes on indefinitely (in both directions).
