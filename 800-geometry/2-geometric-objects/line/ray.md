# Geometry :: Ray

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)#Ray

Given a line and any point `A` on it, we may consider `A` as decomposing this line into two parts. Each part is called a *ray* and the point `A` is called its *initial point*. A ray is also known as half-line, a one-dimensional half-space. The point `A` belongs to the ray.

Intuitively, a ray consists of those points on a line passing through `A` and proceeding indefinitely, starting at `A`, in one direction only along the line. However, in order to use this concept of a ray in proofs a more precise definition is required.

Given distinct points A and B, they determine a unique ray with initial point A. As two points define a unique line, this ray consists of all the points between A and B (including A and B) and all the points C on the line through A and B such that B is between A and C.

This is, at times, also expressed as the set of all points C on the line determined by A and B such that A is not between B and C. A point D, on the line determined by A and B but not in the ray with initial point A determined by B, will determine another ray with initial point A. With respect to the AB ray, the AD ray is called the *opposite ray*.

Thus, we say that two distinct points, A and B, define a line and a decomposition of this line into the disjoint union of an open segment (A,â€‰B) and two rays, BC and AD (the point D is not drawn in the diagram, but is to the left of A on the line AB). These are not opposite rays since they have different initial points.

>In Euclidean geometry, two rays with a common endpoint (vertex) form an angle.

The definition of a ray depends upon the *notion of betweenness* for points on a line. It follows that rays exist only for geometries for which this notion exists, typically Euclidean geometry or affine geometry over an ordered field.

>On the other hand, rays do not exist in projective geometry, nor in a geometry over a non-ordered field, like the complex numbers or any finite field.
