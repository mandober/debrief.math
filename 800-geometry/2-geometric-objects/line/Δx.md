# Δx

The difference between two input values to the function `f` is denoted by `Δx`. If two arguments are labelled `x₀` and `x`, with `x > x₀`, then `Δx = x - x₀`. Actually, `Δx` represents their absolute difference so it is immaterial which argument is larger. Normally, however, `x₀` is a smaller value that remains fixed, while the other argument, `x`, varies. When the difference is of the main interest, the other argument is not named but expressed in terms of `x₀` and a difference, `h`, between them, as `x₀ + h`.
