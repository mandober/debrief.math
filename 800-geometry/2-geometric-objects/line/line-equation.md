# Line equation

Line equations
- slope-intercept line equation: `y = mx + b`
- Point-point line equation: `y - y₀ = m(x - x₀)`, slope `m = (y-y₀)/(x-x₀)`
  
 

A straight line may be defined given two points, or a point and the slope. The slope of a straight line is the same for any point on that line.

The equation (function) for a straight line is `y = mx + b`.

Here,
- `x` is input (i.e. point on x-axis)
- `y` is output, `f(x) = y` (i.e. point on y-axis)
- each pair `(x, y)` defines a point on this straight line
- `m` is the slope of the line (slope determines the rotation of the line)
  - when `m = 0`, the line is horizontal (regardless of the constant `b`)
- `b` determines the line's position (offset from origin)
  - when `b = 0`, the line intersects the origin (0, 0) at some angle θ
  - when `x = 0`, `b` is `y` since `y = 0x + b` is just `b`
- `f` is a function that takes an input `x` and returns an output `y`, and these two numbers (coordinates) define one point, `(x, y)` or `(x, f x)`.


The **slope (gradient) of a line is** a number that describes both the *direction* and *grade* (steepness, incline) of a line.

The **grade (steepness, incline) of a line** is measured by the absolute value of the slope. A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line.

The **direction of a line** is:
- line is *increasing* if it goes *up* from left to right; slope `m > 0`
- line is *decreasing* if it goes *down* from left to right; slope `m < 0`
- if a line is *horizontal*, slope `m = 0` (constant function)
- if a line is *vertical* the slope is `m = undefined`

- slope (gradient) affects a line's direction and grade (steepness, incline).
- slope (gradient) pertains to a line, as do direction and grade (steepness, incline)
