# Length

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length

**Length** is a measure of distance.

In the International System of Quantities, length is a quantity with dimension distance. In most systems of measurement a base unit for length is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units (SI) system, *the base unit for length is the metre*.

Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object. However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position and orientation the object is in. Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used including *height*, *width*, *breadth*, *depth*. Height is used when there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. Length usually measures a horizontal extent of an object, width measures the extent in the second dimension and depth in the third; so the volume of an object is `l×w×d` (length times width times depth) or `h×w×d` (with height instead of length).

Length is the measure of 1 spatial dimension, area is a measure of 2 dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of 3 dimensions (length cubed), provided the object has equal extents in all 3 dimensions.
