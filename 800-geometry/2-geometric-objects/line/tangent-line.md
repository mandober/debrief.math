# Tangent line

Given a circle, a *tangent line* is a line orthogonal to the *radius line segment*. A radius line segment is line segment from the center of the circle to a point on the circle.

with which it has exactly one point in common. A *secant line*, also called a cord, can be drawn given any two distinct points on the circle.

It is also possible to associate secant and tangent line with curves in general. Finding out the tangent line at some point on the curve involves figuring out the line equation to produce it.

A major theme in calclus is differentiation, which can be defined, from the first principles, as the process of figuring out how to determine a tangent line at the point on the curve, given that all we have is a single point and defining a line requires two points.
