# Line equations

Line equations come in many forms
- standard form: `ax + by = c`, so `(x, y)`, `L = { (x, y) | ax + by = c }`
- general form:  `ax + by - c = 0`
- slope-intercept form: `y = mx + b`
- point-slope form: `y - y₀ = m(x - x₀)`, the slope is `m = (y-y₀)/(x-x₀)`
- point-point form: `(y - y₀)(x₁ - x₀) = (y₁ - y₀)(x - x₀)`
  for a line through 2 distinct points, `P₀ = (x₀, y₀)` and `P₁ = (x₁, y₁)`
