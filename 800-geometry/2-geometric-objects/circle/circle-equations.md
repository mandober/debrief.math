# Circle equations

## Rectangular equation

Unit circle (radius, r = 1) centered at origin:

    x² + y² = r²

Circle of radius `r` centered at (h, k)

    (x/h)² + (y/k)² = r²


## Parametric equation

    (cos t, sin t)    where 0 < t < 2π

    (cos a, sin a)t     …with param (slider) a


## Polar equation in terms of cos

A polar equation for a circle, `r = cosθ`, which, in Cartesian plane, is centered at (x=0.5, y=0) and has radius 0.5.

A polar equation for a circle, `r = 2cosθ`, which, in Cartesian plane, is centered at (x=1, y=0) and has radius 1.

A polar equation for a circle, `r = k∙cosθ`, which, in Cartesian plane, is centered at (x=k/2, y=0) and has radius `k/2`.

## Polar equation in terms of sin

A polar equation for a circle, `r = sinθ`, which, in Cartesian plane, is centered at (x=0, y=0.5) and has radius 0.5.

A polar equation for a circle, `r = 2sinθ`, which, in Cartesian plane, is centered at (x=0, y=1) and has radius 1.

A polar equation for a circle, `r = ksinθ`, which, in Cartesian plane, is centered at (x=0, y=k/2) and has radius `k/2`.
