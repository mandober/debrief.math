# Circle

A circle may be defined a set of points that are equidistant from another point, called the center of the circle.

Pythagorean identity relates the sides of a right triangle with its hypotenuse.

A circle may also be defined via the Pythagorean identity:

    x² + y² = r²

which defines a circle of radius `r` centered at the origin. The *unit circle* uses the same equation with `r = 1` so it simlifies to `x² + y² = 1`.

    (x/h)² + (y/k)² = r²

This defines a cricle of radius `r` centered at the point `(h, k)`.

A parametric equation for a circle, `r = cosθ`.

The circumference of a circle is `C = 2πr`. 
The area of a circle is `C = 2πr²`.

There is a million theorems concerning circles.

Circle is the limit of a sequence of equilaterial shapes. The sequence starts with *triangle* as an equilaterial with a minimal number of sides (3 equal sides), followed by *square* (4 equal sides), *pentagon* (5 equal sides), hexagon (6 sides), septagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, …, culminating with circle which sort of has an infinite number of sides, and represents the limit of this sequence.

- traingle (3 equal sides)
- square (4 equal sides)
- pentagon (5 equal sides)
- hexagon (6 equal sides)
- heptagon (7 equal sides)
- octagon (8 equal sides)
- nonagon (9 equal sides)
- decagon (10 equal sides)
- circle (∞ equal sides)
