# Arc length

- Arc length is the distance along a curve between two points.
- Commonly denoted by `s`
- 1 radian subtends an arc length of 1 radius


## Arc length on a circle

- arc length, `Θ = s/r`; if s=1, s/r=1 which is 1 radians
- from `Θ = s/r` follows `s = θr` (if we know the angle and radius)
- if angle `Θ` is in unit circle, so r=1, then arc length is equal to `Θ`
- Θ = π/4, r=1, s = π/4
