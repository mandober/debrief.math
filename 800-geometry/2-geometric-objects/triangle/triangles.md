# Triangles

Similar triangles: same shape, different size
- 2 triangles △ABC and △CEF are similar if
- corresponding angles are equal, ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, ∠C = ∠F
- ratios of corresponding sides are equal, AB:DE = BC:EF = AC:DF
- `AA~` angle-angle similarity
- `SSS~` side-side-side similarity
- `SAS~` side-angle-side similarity

>If two triangles are similar, it means that all corresponding angle pairs are congruent and all corresponding sides are proportional.

The *SAS criterion for triangle similarity* states that if two sides of one triangle are proportional to two sides of another triangle and their included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar. If two triangles `△ABC` and `△DEF` are such that `∠A = ∠D` and `AC:DF = AB:DE` then `△ABC ~ △DEF`. This implies that `BC:EF = AC:DF = AB:DE` and also `∠B = ∠E` and `∠C = ∠F`.

Types of similarity of triangles
- SSS side, side, side
- SAS side, angle, side
- ASA angle, side, angle
- AAS angle, angle side
- HL for right triangles only
- I-AL acronym for "image and line"; refers to two figures that are similar because they have the same shape, but not necessarily the same size.

Two triangles will be similar if the angles are equal (corresponding angles) and sides are in the same ratio or proportion (corresponding sides). Similar triangles may have different individual lengths of the sides of triangles but their angles must be equal and their corresponding ratio of the length of the sides must be the same. If two triangles are similar that means,

- All corresponding angle pairs of triangles are equal.
- All corresponding sides of triangles are proportional.

The `∼` symbol represents similarity; for two similar triangles, `△QPR ∼ △XYZ`

**Similar triangles** have the same shape but may be different in size. They superimpose each other when magnified or demagnified; `△QPR ∼ △XYZ`. The ratio of all the corresponding sides is equal in similar triangles. This common ratio is also called as "scale factor" in similar triangles.

**Congruent triangles** are the same in shape and size. They superimpose each other in their original shape; `△ABC ≅ △QPR`. The ratio of corresponding sides is equal to 1 for congruent triangles.
