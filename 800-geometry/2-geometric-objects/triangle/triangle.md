# Triangles

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle


- Based on the largest angle:
  - acute
  - right
  - obtuse
- Scalene triangle: all sides different
- Equilateral: all sides the same
- Isosceles: two sides the same (2 legs and a base; base angles congruent; vertex angle opposite the base

triangle | scalene    | isosceles         | equilateral
acute    | 3 < 90°    | 1 < 90°, 2 equal  | 3x60° angles
right    | 1x90°      | 1x90°, 2x45°      | ∅
obtuse   | 1 > 90°    | 1 > 90°, 2 equal  | ∅


**Thales' Theorem**: if points A and B are endpoints of the diameter of a circle, then a point C anywhere else on that circle forms a right angle with points A and B.

Corresponding angles/sides: angles/sides in the same relative position in a triangle.

**Similar triangles**: same shape
- corresponding angles are congruent
- corresponding sides are *proportional*
- △ABC ~ △DEF

**Congruent triangles**: same shape and size
- corresponding angles are congruent
- corresponding sides are congruent
- △ABC ≅ △DEF

Flipped or rotated triangles can still be congruent or similar.

Congruent triangles, △ABC ≅ △DEF, imply 6 congruences (3 angles, 3 sides):
- ∠A ≅ ∠D
- ∠B ≅ ∠E
- ∠C ≅ ∠F
- AB ≅ DE
- AC ≅ DF
- BC ≅ EF

Similar triangles, △ABC ~ △DEF, imply 3 congruent angles and 3 proport. sides:

```
∠A ≅ ∠D
∠B ≅ ∠E
∠C ≅ ∠F

AB     AC     BC
--- = ---- = ----
DE     DF     EF
```

## Pythagorean Triples

- the smallest triple: (3,4,5)
- multiples are also Pythagorean triples
  - (3,4,5)∙2 = (6,8,10)
  - (3,4,5)∙3 = (9,12,15)
  - (3,4,5)∙4 = (12,16,20)
  - (3,4,5)∙k …
  - if `(x,y,z)` is a Pythagorean triple then so is `(x,y,z)k`, where k ∈ ℕ
- more Pythagorean triples:
  - (5, 12, 13)
  - (7, 24, 25)
