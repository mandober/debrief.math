# Geometry :: Euclidean geometry :: Point

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(geometry)

In classical Euclidean geometry, a **point** is a primitive notion that models the notion of *identifying an exact location in space*. A point has no length, width, thickness - it is dimensionless. It is the only object of the dimension zero (0D).

In modern mathematics, a point more generally refers to an element of some set, called a *space*. A space contains an infinite number of points, but so does a circle, a square, a line, a ray, a line segment, etc.

Being a primitive notion means that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a point can be introduced either as a primitive or by a set of axioms, neither of which requires proof.

When introduced as an axiom, a point may be defined by some property that must be satisfied, like "there is exactly one line that passes through two distinct points" (although this makes a claim about a line, not directly about a point). A point is usually introduced into a theory as a primitive, though.

With respect to a particular role, a point may be called a *vertex* which is a point where two or more curves, lines, edges meet or intersect. As a consequence of this definition, the point where two lines meet to form an angle and the corners of polygons and polyhedra are vertices.

Once introduced, points are used to define other geometric objects.
* A *line* is determined by 2 distinct points. 
>2 distinct points on the same line are called *colinear*.

* A *plane* is determined by 3 distinct points. 
>3 distinct points on the same plane are called *coplanar*.

In a coordinate system, like the common 2D Cartesian coordinate system, a point models the notion of a location. There, a point is actually a compound object equivalent to an *ordered pair*, denoted `(x, y)`, and called a **coordinate point**. The first component, called *abscisa*, is an *x-coordinate*, i.e. a value on the x-axis, while the second component, called *ordinate*, is an *y-coordinate*, i.e. a value on the y-axis. Paired, these two coordinates identify a unique location in the Cartesian (aka Euclidean) plane. Various geometric shapes can be drawn in the coordinate plane by *plotting* their constituent points as coordinate points.

Typically, however, shapes are rarely plotted as an arbitrary collection of points. Most commonly, the shape is determined from the graph of a function or equation. Functions are actually ideal for this since a function generally maps input values to output values. And since these input-output values are typically numbers, they can be interpreted as `(x, y)` coordinates, where `x` ranges over the function's input values (over the function's domain), and `y` is the value of the function at the corresponding `x`, as `f(x) = y`. In set theory, i.e. in set-theoretic interpretation of functions, a function is a set of ordered pairs `(x, f(x))`, although this set of ordered pairs is only one component of the function - its domain, and especially its codomain, are also important. Nevertheless, people often (incorrectly) identify a function with its graph - the graph of the function is the set of order pairs - and its members are interpreted as coordinates and then plotted to produce a shape that is usually a *curve* of some kind.

Plotting a function according to its graph interpreted as a collection of coordinates `(x, y)` is different from e.g. plotting a general equation, because with functions there is a dependency of `y` on `x`. That means it is enough to know an x-coordinate to get the corresponding y-coordinate by applying the function to `x`. That is why lone `x` values (x-coordinates) are often called "points" - although they are merely one component of a pair. When it comes to functions, the first component of an ordered pair, `x`, is actually enough as it uniquely determines the corresponding point `(x, f(x))`.
