## Abscissa
In a system of coordinates, abscissa is the distance from a point to the y-axis measured parallel to the x-axis. The abscissa is the first or x-coordinate of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. Abscissa, together with ordinate (second or y-coordinate) forms an ordered pair which can define the location of any point in 2D rectangular space.

More technically, the abscissa of a point is the signed measure of its projection on the primary axis. Its absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and its sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive).

## Ambient space
In mathematics, especially in geometry and topology, an ambient space is the space surrounding a mathematical object along with the object itself.

## Angle
An angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the *sides or rays* of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the *vertex* of the angle. Angles formed by two rays are also known as *plane angles* as they lie in the plane that contains the rays. Angles that are formed by the intersection of two planes are called *dihedral angles*.

## Angular velocity
Angular velocity, denoted by ω or Ω, aka *angular frequency vector*, is a pseudovector representation of how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time; i.e. how quickly an object rotates or revolves relative to a point or axis. The magnitude of the pseudovector represents the *angular speed*, the rate at which the object rotates or revolves, and its *direction* is normal to the instantaneous plane of rotation or angular displacement. The orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the right-hand rule. There are two types of angular velocity: orbital and spin angular velocity.

## Axis
- n, sn. axis, pl. axes
- 1. Axis is a fixed reference line for the measurement of coordinates.
- 2. Axis is an imaginary line about which an object rotates.

## Coordinate system
In geometry, a coordinate system is a system that uses a set of numbers, called coordinates, to uniquely specify the position of geometric elements on a manifold.

## Chord
A chord of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circular arc. The infinite line extension of a chord is a secant.

## Codirectionality
Two objects with the same direction are said to be codirectional (as in parallel lines).

## Dihedral angle
An angle formed by the two intersecting planes.

## Dimensionless quantity
A dimensionless quantity (aka bare quantity, pure quantity, quantity of dimension one) is a quantity to which no physical dimension is assigned, with an implicit corresponding SI unit of measurement of one (or 1).

## Disk
In geometry, a disk (disc) is the region of a plane bounded by a circle (region inside the circle). A closed disk includes the circle by which it is bounded. An open disk does not contain its bounding circle.

## Distance
Distance is a numerical, or occasionally qualitative, measurement of how far apart two objects are.

## Displacement
In geometry and mechanics, a displacement is a vector whose length is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point undergoing motion. It quantifies both the distance and direction of the net or total motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point trajectory. A displacement may be identified with the translation that maps the initial position to the final position.

## Euclidean space
Euclidean space is the fundamental space of geometry, intended to represent physical space. Originally, in Euclid's Elements, it was the 3D space of Euclidean geometry, but in modern mathematics there are Euclidean spaces for any positive integer dimension `n`, called Euclidean n-spaces; when `n = 1`, they are commonly called Euclidean lines, and when `n = 2`, they are called Euclidean planes.

## Euclidean line
In geometry, a (straight) line is an infinitely long object with no width, depth, or curvature, an idealization of such physical objects as a straightedge, a taut string, or a ray of light. Lines are spaces of dimension one, which may be embedded in spaces of dimension two, three, or higher. The word line may also refer, in everyday life, to a line segment, which is a part of a line delimited by two points (its endpoints).

## Euclidean plane
A Euclidean plane is a Euclidean space of dimension two, denoted \textbf{E}^2 or \mathbb{E}^2. It is a geometric space in which two real numbers are required to determine the position of each point. It is an affine space, which includes in particular the concept of parallel lines. It has also metrical properties induced by a distance, which allows to define circles, and angle measurement.

## Figure
A geometric figure is a representation of a geometric object including its shape and size (e.g. a figure of the Earth).

## Frame of reference
In math, physics, and astronomy, a frame of reference (reference frame) is an *abstract coordinate system* whose origin, orientation and scale are specified by a set of reference points - geometric points whose position is identified both mathematically (with numerical coordinate values) and physically (signaled by conventional markers).

## Geometry
Geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with properties of abstract space and objects embedded in it. Geometry classifies and studies the types of various objects, their relations, properties, and possible operations that may be performed on them. Along arithmetics, geometry is one the oldest mathematical branches.

## Geometer
Mathematicians working in the field of geometry are called geometers.

## Geometric progression
A sequence of non-zero numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

## Kinematics
The branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies.

## Lemon
In geometry, rotating a 2-dimensional shape called lens, around the axis that goes through its tips, makes a 3-dimensional shape called a lemon.

## Length
Length is a measure of distance. Length is a quantity with dimension distance.

## Lens
In geometry, a lens is, a 2-dimensional shape, a convex region bounded by two circular arcs joined to each other at their endpoints. In order for this shape to be convex, both arcs must bow outwards (convex-convex). This shape can be formed as the intersection of two circular disks. It can also be formed as the union of two circular segments (regions between the chord of a circle and the circle itself), joined along a common chord. A lens looks like `()`, i.e. the intersection of two circles, `⚭`.

## Line
A line is an infinitely long geometric object without width, depth or curvature. A line is one-dimensional (1D) object, but it may be embedded in a higher-dimensional space. A line can be uniquely defined by any two distinct points that lie on it. Given a point, there is an infinite number of lines passing through it.

## Lune
In plane geometry, a lune (Latin `luna` moon) is a 2-dimensional shape, a concave-convex region bounded by two circular arcs. It has one boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points moves outside the region and another boundary portion for which the connecting segment of any two nearby points lies entirely inside the region. A convex-convex region is termed a lens. As an approximation, there are two symmetric lunes in `⚭` (the middle part is called a lens).

## Manifold
A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an n-dimensional manifold, or n-manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space.

## Non-Euclidean geometry
Non-Euclidean geometry consists of two geometries based on axioms closely related to those that specify Euclidean geometry. As Euclidean geometry lies at the intersection of metric geometry and affine geometry, non-Euclidean geometry arises by either replacing the parallel postulate with an alternative, or relaxing the metric requirement. In the former case, one obtains hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry, the traditional non-Euclidean geometries.

## Normal
In geometry, a normal is an object (line, ray, vector) that is perpendicular to a given object.

## Orbital angular velocity
Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a point object revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin.

## Ordinate
The ordinate is the second coordinate of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. More technically, the ordinate of a point is the signed measure of its projection on the secondary axis. Its absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and its sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive).

## Orientation
In geometry, the orientation, attitude, bearing, direction, or angular position of an object - such as a line, plane or rigid body - is part of the description of how it is placed in the space it occupies.

More specifically, it refers to the imaginary rotation that is needed to move the object from a reference placement to its current placement. A rotation may not be enough to reach the current placement. It may be necessary to add an imaginary translation, called the object's location (or position, or linear position). *Location and orientation together fully describe how the object is placed in space*. 

This imaginary rotation and translation may occur in any order, as an object's orientation doesn't change with the translattion, nor does its location change with the rotatation. Euler's rotation theorem shows that in 3D any orientation can be reached with a single rotation around a fixed axis. This gives one common way of representing the orientation using an axis-angle representation. Other widely used methods include rotation quaternions, rotors, Euler angles, or rotation matrices. Unit vector may also be used to represent an object's normal vector orientation or the relative direction between two points. Typically, the orientation is given relative to a frame of reference, usually specified by a Cartesian coordinate system. Two objects sharing the same direction are said to be *codirectional* (as in parallel lines).

## Parallelogram
In Euclidean geometry, a parallelogram is a simple (non-self-intersecting) quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure.

## Plane
A plane is a 2D space or flat surface that extends indefinitely. A plane is a 2D analogue of a point (0D), a line (1D) and space (3D). When working exclusively in 2D Euclidean space, the definite article is used, so "*the* Euclidean plane" refers to the whole space.

## Pi
1. The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (diameter is `2r`) is immortalized as a mathematical constant `π`, approximally equal to `3.141`. π is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed exactly as a ratio of two integers (22/7 is a good enough approximation for most uses); consequently, the decimal expansion of π never ends and has no period (repeating pattern).
2. The function `π : ℕ → ℕ` counts the number of primes up to a number supplied as the argument, e.g. π(100) = 25.

## Polyhedron
Polyhedron

## Polytope
In elementary geometry, a polytope is a geometric object with flat sides (faces). Polytopes are the generalization of three-dimensional polyhedra to any number of dimensions. Polytopes may exist in any general number of dimensions as an -dimensional polytope or -polytope. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope. In this context, "flat sides" means that the sides of a -polytope consist of -polytopes that may have -polytopes in common.

## Position
In geometry, a position or position vector (aka location vector or radius vector) is a Euclidean vector that represents the position of a point P in space in relation to an (arbitrary reference) origin O. A position of an object indicated by a point P corresponds to the straight line segment from the point O (the origin) to P. In other words, it is a displacement (or translation) that maps the origin to a point P.

## Pseudovector
A pseudovector (or axial vector) is a quantity that behaves like a vector in many situations, but its direction does not conform when the object is rigidly transformed by rotation, translation, reflection, etc. This can also happen when the orientation of the space is changed.

## Radian
Radian (`rad`) is a unit of measurement of angles. 1 radians is equal to the angle that an arc, of the circle, of length equal to 1 radius, subtends with the x-axis. The measured angle is in the standard position with its initial ray coinciding with the x-axis; its terminal side coincides with the line drawn from the center of the circle to a point `P` on the circle. The point `P` is exactly 1 radius away from the point on the circle that subtends the null angle (the point where the circle intersects the x-axis).

## Rectangle
In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with 4 right angles. It can also be defined as an *equiangular quadrilateral*; or a *parallelogram* containing a right angle. A rectangle whose 4 sides are equal is a square. Sometimes, *oblong* refers to a non-square rectangle.

## Rectangular space
Rectangular space is the Euclidean space in the 2D Cartesian coordinate system.

## Rotation
Rotation or rotational motion is the circular movement of an object around a central line, known as axis of rotation. A plane figure (2D object) can rotate in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction around an axis that is perpendicular to the figure. The axis that is the center of rotation may intersect the figure's plane anywhere - within or outside the figure. A solid figure (3D object) has an infinite number of possible central axes and rotational directions; a special case is a rotation around an axis.

## Rhombus
In plane Euclidean geometry, a rhombus (pl. rhombi or rhombuses) is a quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length; thus, it is an equilateral quadrilateral.

## Shape
A shape is a graphical representation of an object's form or its external boundary, outline, or external surface. It is distinct from other object properties, such as color, texture, material. In geometry, shape excludes information about the object's position, size, orientation and chirality. A figure is a representation of an object including its shape and size (e.g. a figure of the Earth).

## Solid geometry
Solid geometry or stereometry is the geometry of 3D Euclidean space. A solid figure is the region of 3D space bounded by a 2D closed surface; e.g. a solid ball consists of a sphere and its interior.

## Spin angular velocity
Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its center of rotation and is independent of the choice of origin, in contrast to orbital angular velocity.

## Unit vector
A unit vector in a *normed vector space* is a vector (often a spatial vector) of length 1. A unit vector is often denoted by a lowercase letter with a circumflex (or a "hat") above it, e.g. `î` (i-hat) usually denotes the unit vector aligned with x-axis, `ĵ` denotes the unit vector of y-axis, and `k̂` the unit vector of z-axis.

## Velocity
Velocity is the speed and the direction of motion of an object. Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics. Velocity is usually represented as a vector whose magnitude is speed. Speed only indicates how fast a body is moving, but velocity also indicates the direction of the movement.

## y-intercept
In analytic geometry, using the common convention that the horizontal axis represents a variable `x` and the vertical axis represents a variable `y`, a *y-intercept* or *vertical intercept* is a point where the graph of a function or relation intersects the y-axis of the coordinate system. As such, these points satisfy `x = 0`.
