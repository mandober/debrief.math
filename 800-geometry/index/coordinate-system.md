# Coordinate system

Coordinate systems
- abstract coordinate system
- Cartesian coordinate system
- polar coordinate system
- cylindrical coordinate system
- spherical coordinate system

Coordinate system properties
- origin
- orientation
- scale
- coordinate
- x-coordinate
- y-coordinate
- axes
- semiaxes
- x-axis and y-axis
- ticks, tick marks, coordinate markings
- dimension(s)
- relative distance
- proportion, relative propertions of ticks on the axes
- perspective
- projection

A 3D projection (or graphical projection) is a design technique used to display a three-dimensional (3D) object on a two-dimensional (2D) surface. These projections rely on visual perspective and aspect analysis to project a complex object for viewing capability on a simpler plane.
