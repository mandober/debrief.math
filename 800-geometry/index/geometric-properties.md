derivatives of position:
- first derivative of position: velocity
- second derivative of position: acceleration
- third derivative of position: jerk
- fourth derivative of position: snap
- fifth derivative of position: crackle
- sixth derivative of position: pop

displacement (speed) ∙ velocity ∙ acceleration ∙ jerk ∙ snap ∙ crackle ∙ pop

motion-wise derivatives (position vector derivatives wrt time)
- position (m), displacement
- velocity (m/s): speed + direction, speed (m/s) (directionless)
- acceleration (m/s²)
- jerk, jolt (m/s³)
- snap, jounce (m/s⁴)
- crackle (m/s⁵)
- pop (m/s⁶)

A shape is a graphical representation of an object's form or its external boundary, outline, or external surface. It is distinct from other object properties, such as color, texture, material. In geometry, shape excludes information about the object's position, size, orientation and chirality.
