# Relations: Summary


(x,y) âˆˆ R 
or 
xRy (x is "R-related" to y)

R: X -> Y

A relation $$R$$ from set $$X$$ (domain) to set $$Y$$ (codomain), where $$x \in X$$ and $$y \in Y$$, is denoted as $$(x,y) \in R$$ or $$xRy$$ (x is R-related to y).

If the sets are equal, the Cartesian product, $$X\times X$$, is denoted by $$X^2$$ and a relation is $$xRx$$

**A relation is a subset** of the Cartesian product, $$R \subseteq X\times Y$$

**A relation is an element** of the powerset of the Cartesian product of sets, $$R \in \mathcal{P}(X\times Y)$$

Total number of relations of an n-element set with itself is $$|\mathcal{P}(X^2)| = 2^{n^2}$$
