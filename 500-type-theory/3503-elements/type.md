# Type

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type

In modern logic, we understand that every variable should have a type, or domain of discourse, or be of some sort. For instance, we say that if a variable `n` is constrained to be an integer, then "`n` is of integer type" or "`n` is of type ℤ". The usual formal expression from set theory to denote this, i.e. `n ∈ ℤ`, is replaced with the form `n : ℤ`.

We speak of *typed logic* if this typing of variables is enforced by the metalanguage. In formulations of a theory the types are often called *sorts*. More generally, type theory formalizes reasoning with such typed variables. And *untyped logic* may be seen as simply a special case, in which there is only a single unique type; thus, untyped logic has one type, not no type.
