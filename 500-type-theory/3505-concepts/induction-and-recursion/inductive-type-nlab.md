# Inductive type

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/inductive+type

In terms of categorical semantics, an *inductive type* is a type whose interpretation is given by an initial algebra of an endofunctor.

This has the usual meaning in ordinary category theory. In applications to *(∞,1)-category theory*, the uniqueness clause in the notion of initial object is modified to allow for a contractible space of choices (as discussed at initial object in an (∞,1)-category), and this difference is reflected accordingly in the type-theoretic set-up. The syntax will give back the traditional meaning whenever equality is interpreted extensionally.

There are two equivalent ways of defining the judgement rules for inductive types. The first describes *elimination on dependent types over the given type*, which is a formalization of the notion of induction, and discussed in: 

* Induction: dependent elimination, computation

The second describes elimination on absolute types. This is the formalization of the notion of recursion, and discussed in

* Recursion: elimination, computation
