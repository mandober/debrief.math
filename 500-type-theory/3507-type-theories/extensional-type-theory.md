**Extensional type theory** denotes the flavor of type theory in which identity types are demanded to be propositions (of `h-level 1`). In other words, they are determined by their extensions - the collection of pairs of points which are equal.

Type theory which is not extensional is called intensional type theory.

NB. The word "extensional" in type theory (even when applied to identity types) sometimes refers instead to the axiom of function extensionality. In general this property is orthogonal to the one considered here: function extensionality can hold or fail in both extensional and intensional type theory. In particular, homotopy type theory is intensional in that identity types are crucially not demanded to be propositions, but function extensionality is often assumed (in terms of these intensional identity types, of course) - in particular, it follows from the univalence axiom.
