**Intensional type theory** is the flavor of type theory in which identity types are not necessarily propositions, that is, `(-1)-truncated`.

Martin-LÃ¶f's original definition of identity types, and their equivalent formulation as inductive types, are by default intensional; one has to impose extra axioms or rules in order to get extensional type theory (in which identity types are propositions).

In particular, *homotopy type theory is intensional*, because identity types represent path objects.

Note that some type theorists use "intensional type theory" to refer to type theory which fails to satisfy *function extensionality*, which is, in general, an orthogonal requirement to how we are using the term here.
