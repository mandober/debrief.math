Type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal logics and rewrite systems, but most of all in set theory.

Later, type theory referred to a class of formal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives to naive set theory as a foundation of mathematics.

Type theory has been tied to formal mathematics since `Principia Mathematica`, and it is a very active field today, especially through the development of proof assistants.
