# Type Theory :: About

* Type Theory was initiated by Bertrand Russell, soon after discovering the Russell's paradox in set theory. Most pressingly, he was authoring "Principia Mathematica" with Whitehead, and needed to quickly find a way out of the problems of set theory, especially those brough about by the axiom of (unrestricted) comprehension. Russell and Whitehead were creating a system of logic for their book which, of copurse, needed to be consistent and free of paradoxes, particularly because their aim was to show that mathematics is entirely based on logic. This position is called *logicism* and it was popular at the time, but eventually failed.



* Types were conceived as a way to avoid set-theoretical paradoxes.

* The fundamental idea behind type theory is to gain the ability to distinguish between different types of objects.

* A *type system* is a formal system in which every term has a property called "type", which defines a term's meaning, as well as operations that may be performed on it.
