The fundamental idea behind type theory is to gain the ability to distinguish between different types of objects.

Type theory is an umbrella term for a class of theories that deal with the notion of type. It encompasses a vast number of subclasses, each with a myriad of subclasses, and subclasses of subclasses, amounting to an incredible number of concrete type theories.
