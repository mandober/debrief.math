# Type Theory :: History

## Short history of Type Theory

The notion of types was introduced by Bertrand Russell in 1900's as means to escape the paradoxes of set theory. Namely, the unrestricted comprehension axiom led to the Russell's paradox, so by classifying sets according to a type Russell intended to avoid it. This was Russell's Ramified Stratified) Type Theory in which a set of some type `i` could only be a member of a set whose type was `i + 1` at least.

In the 1930's Church came up with λ-calculus formalism that he indended to use as a logic system but it turned out inconsistent. In the 1940's Church made a consistent system by introducing types, yielding Simply-typed λ-calculus.

In 1972, Per Martin-Löf introduced a series of type theories, and included dependent types. One of the key features of a dependent type theory is that it unifies set theory and logic.

In 2006, Awodey and Warren, and Voevodsky, discovered that type theory has homotopical models, with Voevodsky introducing homotopy type theory which has a new notion of equality of types as homotopies (paths on manifold).


## History of Type Theory

Type Theory was initiated by Bertrand Russell, soon after he discovered the Russell's paradox in set theory. Most pressingly, he was authoring "Principia Mathematica" with Whitehead, and needed to quickly find a way out of the problems of set theory, especially those brough about by the axiom of (unrestricted) comprehension. Russell and Whitehead were creating a system of logic for their book which, of copurse, needed to be consistent and free of paradoxes, particularly because their aim was to show that mathematics is entirely based on logic. This position is called logicism and it was gaining popularity at the time, even though it eventually failed.
