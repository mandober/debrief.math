# Foundations 3: Universal Constructions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE2nuSK7Ckk

In this video, we introduce initial objects, products, coproducts, and xponential objects. We describe the universal constructions for these structures in category theory, and describe their appearance in set theory. We also sketch how these ideas correspond with logic in the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism (computational trinitarianism).
