# Foundations 4: Logic and Partially Ordered Sets

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_QaYRwkT2c

In this video we introduce classical logic, using functional representations of AND, OR, NOT and IMPLIES, and then we consider posets of subsets, introduce Boolean algebras, and eventually discuss Heyting Algebras as bicartesian closed categories, and discuss how our universal constructions of categorical products and coproducts give us ideas like AND and OR in intuitionistic logic. In this way we start to understand computational trinitarianism (which relates to the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence, and the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation).
