# Type theory

Type theory here begins with an exploration of type systems based on lambda calculus, with Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC), `λ→`, as the simplest form of the typed λ-calculi. λ cube classifies the extensions of STLC, with each dimension providing one of these 3 new features: polymorphism, type ctors and dependent types.

- λ→ has functions from terms to terms
- λ2 has functions from types to terms (polymorphic types)
- λω has functions from types to types (type functions)
- λΠ has functions from terms to types (dependent types)

Calculus Cf constructions (CoC), `λC`, combines all of these features.

Type theories beyond the calculi of λ cube are then examined.
