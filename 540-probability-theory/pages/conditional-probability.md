# Conditional probability

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability

In probability theory, **conditional probability** is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion, evidence) has already occurred.

This particular method relies on event `B` occurring with some sort of relationship with another event `A`. In this event, the event `B` can be analyzed by a conditionally probability with respect to `A`.

If the event of interest is `A` and the event `B` is known to have occurred, the conditional probability of `A` given `B` (or the probability of `A` under the condition `B`), is usually denoted by `P(A|B)`. This can also be understood as the fraction of probability `B` that intersects with `A`:

```js
P(A ⋂ B) 
--------- = P(A|B)
P(B)
```
