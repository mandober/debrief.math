# Birthday problem

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem

In probability theory, the **birthday problem** asks for the probability that, in a set of `n` randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The *birthday paradox* is that, counterintuitively, the probability of a shared birthday exceeds 50% in a group of only 23 people.

The birthday paradox is a veridical paradox: it appears wrong, but is in fact true. While it may seem surprising that only 23 individuals are required to reach a 50% probability of a shared birthday, this result is made more intuitive by considering that the comparisons of birthdays will be made between every possible pair of individuals. With 23 individuals, there are (23Ã—22)/2 = 253 pairs to consider, which is well over half the number of days in a year.

Real-world applications for the birthday problem include a cryptographic attack called the *birthday attack*, which uses this probabilistic model to reduce the complexity of finding a collision for a hash function, as well as calculating the approximate risk of a hash collision existing within the hashes of a given size of population.
