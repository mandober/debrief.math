# Curry-Howard correspondence

The Curry-Howard correspondence is the interpretation of *proofs as programs* and *formulae as types*. The idea starting in 1934 with *Haskell Curry* and finalized in 1969 with *William Alvin Howard*. It connected the "computational component" of many type theories to the derivations in logics.

Howard showed that the Typed Lambda Calculus corresponded to *Intuitionistic Natural Deduction* (natural deduction without the law of excluded middle).

The connection between types and logic lead to a lot of subsequent research to find new type theories for existing logics and new logics for existing type theories.
