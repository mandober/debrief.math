# Measure theory

*Measure theory* was invented by the French mathematician Henry Lebesgue as a side quest during the development of his approach to integration process. While Lebesgue was trying to define his integral, he also proposed measure theory which he needed in order to define, what is now called, a *Lebesgue integral*.

*Lebesgue integral* is an improved method of integration compared to the previously dominant *Riemann integral*. Riemann has approached the problem of integration - commonly presented as finding the area beneath the curve defined by a function over a definite interval - by partitioning the domain of the function. This partitioning divides the interval into numerous subintervals, each of which acts as a very small (width-wise) side of a rectangle inscribed over with, where the height of the rectangle is defined by the function.

For example, given a function `f(x) = x²`, the graph of which has the shape of a parabola, we may ask for the area under this graph over the interval [a,b] where `a` and `b` are both values on the x-axis (input values, `x`), usually with `b > a`, for example [0,3]. The area can be roughly approximated by dividing this interval into a large number of subintervals, then summing up the area of all these rectangles drawn over each subiunterval; each rectangle would have the same width, `Δx`, as determined by the difference between interval's upper and lower bound (in this case 3-0=3), and the number of rectangles we want to consider for the current approximation, `Δx = (b - a) / n`. With `n=6` (6 rectangles), the width of each would be `Δx=6`. The interval [a,b] = [0,3] would be split into 6 subintervals, defined by the sequence of values on the x-axis: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, such that, e.g. the first rectangle has the side coinciding with the line segment 0-0.5 on x axis; the second would lie on 0.5-1, third on 1-1.5, 4th on 1.5-2, 5th on 1.5-2, and 6th on 2-2.5




That is, if the interval is `[a, b]`, which are values on the x-axis, i.e. inputs to the function `f(x)`, with `b > a`, 

a subinterval from `xᵢ` to `xᵢ﹢₁`

, each of which defines one side of rectangles inscribed under the curve to approximate the area, with the other side (i.e. height) defined by the function.


and thus the interval over which the integration was performed, into many subintervals that acted as the common side of rectangles with the height defined by the function.

usually taking the form of rectangles
