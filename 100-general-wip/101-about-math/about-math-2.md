## Representation

Mathematics is the study of systems of elementary objects, whose only considered nature is to be exact, unambiguous (two objects are equal or different, related or not, an operation gives an exact result, etc.).

Mathematics as a whole can be seen as the science of all "possible worlds" of this kind of exact objects.

Some philosophies conceive mathematics as existing independently of the objective world, while some deem it as just a product of the human mind. In any case, some forms of representation are required to study it. Different approaches in studying a particular math field, may be equivalent in that they produce the same results, but have various degrees of efficiency and relevance.

Ideas that are at first comprehended intuitively may be formalized in order to communicate them to others.

A specific representation may be freed from the limits and biases of its form by translating it into other representations. Conversions between different forms of representations abound in mathematics.

Formalizing a body of mathematical knowlegde is done by expressing the comprising statements as formulas, usually, in first-order logic (FOL).

In FOL, a first-order theory is given by a set of axioms stated in a particular formal language of logic.


A **mathematical model** is an abstract description of a concrete system using mathematical concepts and language.

The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in applied mathematics and in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, chemistry) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science, electrical engineering), as well as in non-physical systems such as the social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology, political science). It can also be taught as a subject in its own right.

The use of mathematical models to solve problems in business or military operations is a large part of the field of operations research.

Mathematical models are also used in music, linguistics, and philosophy (for example, intensively in analytic philosophy).

A model may help to explain a system and to study the effects of different components, and to make predictions about behavior.


## Theories

Mathematics is split into diverse fields according to the subject matters.

Formalizing a mathematical concept around some central idea builds a body of mathematical knowledge that is called a theory. A theory consists of proven propositions called theorems. A theory studies a system of objects called a *model* and there may be many different suitable models - each model of a theory may be just one possible interpretation - a single model among many other valid models.
