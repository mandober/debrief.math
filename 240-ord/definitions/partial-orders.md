# Order Theory :: Definitions related to partial orders

- `ℝ` (set of real numbers)
- `S ⊆ ℝ ⋀ S ≠ ∅`, a set S is a nonempty subset of ℝ


The supremum of `S`, if exists denoted by `sup(S)`, is some `𝓊₀ ∈ S` s.t.
- `𝓊₀` is an upper bound of `S`
- for all upper bounds `𝓊` of `S`, `𝓊₀ <= 𝓊`


The **infimum** of S, `inf(S)`, if one exists, is some elem `𝓁₀ ∈ S` s.t.
- `𝓁₀` is a lower bound of `S`
- for all lower bounds `𝓁` of `S`, `𝓁₀ >= 𝓁`

S ⊆ ℝ. 
∃𝓁 ∈ ℝ. ∀s ∈ S. 𝓁

S ⊆ ℝ. 
∃𝓊 ∈ ℝ. ∀s ∈ S. 𝓊
