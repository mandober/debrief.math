# Linear extension

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_extension

In order theory, a *linear extension* of a partial order is a linear order (total order) that is compatible with the partial order.

As a classic example, the lexicographic order of totally ordered sets is a linear extension of their product order.

## Definitions

Given any partial orders `⩽` and `⩽∗` on a set X, 
`⩽∗` is a linear extension of `⩽` exactly when
1. `⩽∗` is a total order, and 
2. `∀x,y ∈ X. x ⩽ y --> x ⩽∗ y`

The second property inspires the description of `⩽∗` as extending `⩽`.

Alternatively, a *linear extension* may be viewed as an order-preserving (monotonic) bijection from a poset `P` to a chain `C` on the same ground set (chain refers to a subset of a poset that is totally ordered for the induced order).
