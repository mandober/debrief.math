# Greatest and least element

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_element_and_least_element

In order theory, **the greatest element**, 
of a subset `S` of a poset, 
is an element of `S` 
that is greater than 
every other element of `S`.

Dually, **the least element**, 
of a subset `S` of a poset, 
is an element of `S` 
that is smaller than 
every other element of `S`.
