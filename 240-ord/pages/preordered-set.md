# Preordered set

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preordered_set

In order theory, a **preorder** (quasiorder) is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive.

Preorders are more general than equivalence relations and (non-strict) partial orders, both of which are special cases of a preorder:
- an antisymmetric preorder is a partial order
- a symmetric preorder is an equivalence relation

```
        preorder (quasiorder)
          + reflexivity
          + transitivity
                /   \
               /     \
              /       \
antisymmetry +         + symmetry
= partial order          = equivalence relation
```
