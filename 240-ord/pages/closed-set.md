# Closed set

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set

A **closed set** is a set that contains all its boundary (limit) points/elems. 
A closed set is a set whose complement is an open set. 

In a topological space, a closed set can be defined as a set which contains all its limit points. In a complete metric space, a closed set is a set which is closed under the limit operation. It should not be confused with a closed manifold.

## Examples

- The closed interval [a,b] of real numbers is closed.
- The open interval (a,b) of real numbers is open.
- The unit interval [0,1] is closed in the metric space of real numbers, and the set [0,1] ∩ ℚ of rational numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) is closed in the space of rational numbers, but [0,1] ∩ ℚ is not closed in the real numbers.
- Some sets are neither open nor closed, for instance the half-open interval `[0,1)` in the real numbers.
- Some sets are both open and closed and are called *clopen* sets.
- The ray [1,∞) is closed.
- The *Cantor set* is an unusual closed set in the sense that it consists entirely of boundary points and is *nowhere dense*.
- Singleton points (and thus finite sets) are closed in T1 spaces and Hausdorff spaces.
- The set of integers ℤ is an infinite and unbounded closed set in the real numbers.
- If `f : X → Y` is a function between topological spaces then `f` is continuous iff preimages of closed sets in `Y` are closed in `X`.
