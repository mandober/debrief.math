# Completeness

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(order_theory)

In order theory, the completeness property asserts the existence of a certain infima or suprema of a partially ordered set.

The most familiar example is the completeness of the real numbers. A special use of the term refers to complete partial orders or complete lattices. However, many other notions of completeness exist.

The motivation for considering completeness properties derives from the great importance of suprema (least upper bound, join, `⋁`) and infima (greatest lower bound, meet, `⋀`) to the theory of partial orders.

Finding a supremum means to single out one distinguished least element from the set of upper bounds.

On the one hand, these special elements often embody certain concrete properties that are interesting for the given application (such as being the least common multiple of a set of numbers or the union of a collection of sets).

On the other hand, the knowledge that certain types of subsets are guaranteed to have suprema or infima enables us to consider the computation of these elements as total operations on a partially ordered set. For this reason, posets with certain completeness properties can often be described as algebraic structures of a certain kind. In addition, studying the properties of the newly obtained operations yields further interesting subjects.
