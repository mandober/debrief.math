# Monotonic function

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function

In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order.

This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory.
