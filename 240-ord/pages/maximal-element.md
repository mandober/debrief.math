In order theory, a minimal element of a subset S of some preordered set A, is an element x ∈ S that is not greater than any other element in S.


In order theory, a maximal element of a subset S of some preordered set A, is an element x ∈ S that is not smaller than any other element in S.

S ⊆ A ⋀ ∃x(x ∈ S ⋀ ∀y(y ∈ S ⋀ x > y))


Dually, a maximal element of a subset S of some preordered set A, S ⊆ A, is an element y ∈ S that is not smaller than any other element in S.

The notions of maximal and minimal elements are weaker than those of greatest element and least element which are also known, respectively, as maximum and minimum.

The maximum or the greatest element of a subset S of some preordered set A is an element x ∈ S which is greater than or equal to any other element of S.

The minimum of S is defined dually.

The minimum or the least element of a subset S of some preordered set A is an element x ∈ S which is smaller than or equal to any other element of S.

In the particular case of a partially ordered set, while there can be at most one maximum and at most one minimum, there may be multiple maximal or minimal elements.

Specializing further to totally ordered sets, the notions of maximal element and maximum coincide, and the notions of minimal element and minimum coincide.
