## Acyclic relation
A binary relation is acyclic if it contains no "cycles"; or, equivalently, its transitive closure is antisymmetric.

## Antichain
An antichain is a poset in which no two elements are comparable. In other words, the order relation of an antichain is just the identity relation.

## Chain
A chain is a totally ordered subset of a poset.

## Complete chain
A complete chain is a poset in which every chain has a least upper bound.

## Cyclic order
Cyclic orders are orderings in which any triple of elements is either ordered clockwise or counterclockwise.

## Greatest element
The greatest element (of a subset `S` of a poset) is an element of `S` that is greater than every other element of `S`.

## Lattice
Lattices are posets in which each pair of elements has GLB and LUB.

## Least element
The least element (of a subset `S` of a poset) is an element of `S` that is smaller than every other element of `S`.

## Linear extension
An extension of a given partial order to a total order is a linear extension of that partial order.

## Order theory
Order theory is a branch of mathematics that studies various kinds of binary relations that capture the intuitive notion of ordering, providing a framework for determining when one object precedes another.

## Preorder
Preorders are generalizations of posets, but they allow ties, which are represented as equivalences and are distinct from incomparabilities.

## Semiorder
Semiorders are subfamilies of posets with certain restrictions (e.g. numerical values that are too close to each other are incomparable by restriction).

## Total order
A total order is a partial order in which any two elements are comparable. A total order is a binary relation on a set that is reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive and strongly-connected. Total orders are also called linear, simple, connex, and full orders.

## Totally ordered set
A set equipped with a total order is a totally ordered set, also called linearly ordered set (loset).

## Well-order
A wellorder is a total order in which every non-empty subset has a least element.

## Well-quasi-ordering
A well-quasi-ordering is a class of preorders generalizing the well-orders.

## Weak order
Weak orders are generalization of total orders allowing ties (represented either as equivalences, or transitive incomparabilities in strict weak orders).
