# Ordered set

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_set

In order theory, a **partially ordered set** (poset) formalizes and generalizes the intuitive concept of an ordering, sequencing, or arrangement of the elements of a set.

A poset consists of a carrier set together with an attached binary relation that endows the set with an ordering relation, which indicates that, for some pairs of elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other in the ordering.

The relation itself is called a *partial order*. The word "partial" (in partial order and partially ordered set) is used as an indication that not every pair of elements is comparable (there may be pairs of elements for which neither element precedes the other).

Partial orders generalize total orders, in which every pair is comparable.

For example, the set â„• with a binary relation `<=` is a total order.

A well-known example of a partial order is the standard type of floating point numbers (e.g. binary64) used in many PLs; it contains special elements (`NaN`, `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, etc.) which are not comparable between themselves or with any other element (value).
