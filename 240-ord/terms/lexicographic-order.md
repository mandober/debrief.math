# Lexicographic order

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order

The lexicographic (lexicographical) order (aka lexical order, dictionary order) is a generalization of the alphabetical order of the dictionaries to sequences of ordered symbols, or, more generally, of elements of a totally ordered set.

There are several variants and generalizations of the lexicographical ordering.
* One variant applies to sequences of different lengths by comparing the lengths of the sequences before considering their elements.
* Another variant, widely used in combinatorics, orders subsets of a given finite set by assigning a total order to the finite set, and converting subsets into increasing sequences, to which the lexicographical order is applied.

A generalization defines an order on a Cartesian product of partially ordered sets; this order is a total order if and only if all factors of the Cartesian product are totally ordered.

## Motivation and definition

The words in a *lexicon* (the set of words used in some language) have a conventional ordering, used in dictionaries and encyclopedias, that depends on the underlying ordering of the alphabet of symbols used to build the words. The lexicographical order is one way of formalizing word order given the order of the underlying symbols.
