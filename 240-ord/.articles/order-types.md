## Types of ordered sets in order theory

* *Cyclic orders*: orderings in which triples of elements are either clockwise or counterclockwise.

* *Lattices*: partial orders in which each pair of elements has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. Many different types of lattice have been studied; see map of lattices for a list.

* *Complete lattice*: is a partially ordered set in which all subsets have both a supremum (join) and an infimum (meet).

* *Partially ordered sets* (posets): orderings in which some pairs are comparable and others might not be.

* *Preorders*: a generalization of partial orders allowing ties (represented as equivalences and distinct from incomparabilities).

* *Semiorders*: partial orders determined by comparison of numerical values, in which values that are too close to each other are incomparable; a subfamily of partial orders with certain restrictions.

* *Total orders*: orderings that specify, for every two distinct elements, which one is less than the other.

* *Weak orders*: generalizations of total orders allowing ties (represented either as equivalences or, in strict weak orders, as transitive incomparabilities).

* *Well-orders*: total orders in which every non-empty subset has a least element.

* *Well-quasi-orderings*: a class of preorders generalizing the well-orders.
