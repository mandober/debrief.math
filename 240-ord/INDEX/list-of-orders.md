# List of orders

List of orders
* List of orders based on a binary relation
  - Preorder
  - Partial order
  - Total order
    - linear order
    - chain
    - simple order
    - connex
    - full order
  - Equivalence relation
  - Identity relation

  - Strict order
  - Semiorder
  - Weak order
  - Well-order
  - Well-quasi-ordering


* List of orders based on a ternary relation
  - Cyclic order


* List of ordered sets
  - Ordered set (any ordered set in general)
  - Preordered set
  - Partially ordered set (poset)
  - Totally ordered set (toset)
    - Linearly ordered set (loset)

* List of lattices
  - semilattices
    - meet semilattice (poset with unique glb)
    - join semilattice (poset with unique lub)
  - lattice (poset that is both meet and join semilattice)
  - bounded lattice `(L, ⊑)`: lattice with a maximum and minimum
    - maximum elemnet, top, `⊤`
    - minimum elemnet, bottom, `⊥`
  - complete lattices `(L, ⊑)`: lattice with a glb and lub
    - least upper bound (LUB), join, supremum, `⊓`
    - greatest lower bound (GLB), meet, infimum, `⊔`
    - each complete lattice is a bounded lattice: `⊤ = sup(L)`, `⊥ = inf(L)`
