# List of order structures

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_order_structures_in_mathematics

Ordered set in order theory:

- *Cyclic order*: order in which triples of elements are either clockwise (cw) or counterclockwise (ccw)

- **Lattice**, partial orders in which each pair of elements has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. Many different types of lattice have been studied; see map of lattices for a list.
- **Partially ordered set (poset)**, orderings in which some pairs are comparable and others might not be
- **Preorder**, a generalization of partial orders allowing ties (represented as equivalences and distinct from incomparabilities)
- **Semiorder**, partial orders determined by comparison of numerical values, in which values that are too close to each other are incomparable; a subfamily of partial orders with certain restrictions
- **Total order**, orderings that specify, for every two distinct elements, which one is less than the other. that is, all elements are comparable.
- **Weak order**, generalization of total order allowing ties (represented either as equivalence or, in strict weak orders, as transitive incomparability)
- **Well-order**, total order in which every non-empty subset has an infinum
- **Well-quasi-ordering**, a class of preorders generalizing the well-orders
