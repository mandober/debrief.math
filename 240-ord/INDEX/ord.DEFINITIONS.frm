# Order Theory :: DEFINITIONS

Let
- `F` be an ordered field
- `S ⊆ F` and `S ≠ ∅`

The infimum of `S`, if exists denoted by `inf(S)`, is some `m₀ ∈ F` s.t.
1. `m₀` is a lower bound of `S`
2. for all lower bounds `m` of `S`, `m₀ >= m`

The supremum of `S`, if exists denoted by `sup(S)`, is some `n₀ ∈ F` s.t.
1. `n₀` is an upper bound of `S`
2. for all upper bounds `n` of `S`, `n₀ <= n`
