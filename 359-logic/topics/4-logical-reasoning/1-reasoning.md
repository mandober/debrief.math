# Logic :: Logical reasoning :: Reasoning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning

*Reasoning* (often conflated with *thinking*) is a mental activity of deriving new information from the existing knowledge. People often reason irrationally and illogically as witnessed by the TV. Even when striving to reason correctly, we accidently or deliberately fall pray to numerous fallices and fail miserably.

*Logical reasoning* or *inference* is a type of reasoning that relies on logic to derive new information from the existing knowledge, with a side quest of persuing the truth. People often reason logically in an incorrect manner as witnessed by the tremendous amount of logical fallacies. Even when we put in the effort to do it correctly, a slew of cognitive biases kicks in to make sure we fail miserably, again.

Logical reasoning is a subject of logic. Logic studies the correct ways in which logical reasoning forms logically valid arguments. The 3 main types of
logical reasoning are *deductive reasoning*, *inductive reasoning*, and *abductive reasoning*.

Aristotle drew a distinction between logical *discursive reasoning* (proper reasoning), and *intuitive reasoning*, in which the reasoning process through intuition - however valid - may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque.

In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.
