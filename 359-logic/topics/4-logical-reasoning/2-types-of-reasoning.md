## Discursive reasoning
Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reasoning proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition - however valid - may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque.

## Intuitive reasoning
Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reasoning proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition - however valid - may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque.

## Reasoning by default
Reasoning by default: conclusions may be derived only because of lack of evidence to the contrary.

## Abductive reasoning

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning

Abductive reasoning (abduction, abductive inference, retroduction) is a form of *logical inference* that seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations. Abductive reasoning, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not definitively verify it. Abductive conclusions do not eliminate uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as "best available" or "most likely". One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation, although not all uses of the terms "abduction" and "inference to the best explanation" are equivalent. In the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law, computer science, and AI research spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction. Diagnostic expert systems frequently employ abduction. The game "Mastermind" encourages the use of abduction in order to infer the secret colors based on the set of all previous guesses.

## Adaptive reasoning
Adaptive reasoning refers to a problem solving strategy that adapts reasoning to address a problem as it changes and evolves.

## Analogical reasoning
Analogical reasoning is a form of reasoning that finds similarities between two or more things and then uses those characteristics to find other qualities common to them. It is based on the brain's tendency to notice patterns and make associations. Once the brain recognizes a pattern, it can associate the pattern with specific things, and this leads to analogous reasoning. Analogous reasoning can help understanding something by looking for similarities between different things.

## Cause-and-effect reasoning
Cause-and-effect reasoning is a type of reasoning used to imply the link between events, such that one event is taken as the cause of the other. It is employed to explain the desired (or undesired) consequence of some action, or to offer explanation as to why things happen when particular conditions are met. This type of reasoning often guides everyday decision-making and draws on the previous favorable outcomes. Businesses also use prediction and forecast modeling. For instance, a marketing agency may use cause-and-effect reasoning to show the value of its campaigns and request a budget increase. To justify it, they may present the past instances when the increase in budget resulted in the increase of sales.

## Critical thinking
Critical thinking requires completely disengaging the autopilot and fully switching to the type 2 mode of cognition, as well as activating the rational extensions of the advance critical though (REACT). These extensions require the second update pack of the latest generation of reasoning capabilities. Critical thinking plays a vital role in life and technical troubleshooting. It is used to assess the authenticity of works of art. It also plays an essential role in gray and other, less understood, matters. For example, the general manager of a family restaurant gets notice that a bakery important to their supply is about to go on strike. Activating REACT, they hire a squad of goons to make sure nothing interferes with their business (by teaching them how to bake).

## Decompositional reasoning
Decompositional reasoning is the process of tackling a complex problem by breaking it into its constituent parts and learning the function of each atomic component. As we comprehend them and learn how each component contributes to the whole, we abstract the smaller parts into the bigger units, and keep on generalizing until we eventually synthesize the original problem. A complex problem is thus decomposed and understood in terms of its parts. This approach is a hallmark of human reasoning and problem solving, and works great when applicable, i.e. when the whole is a sum of its parts, which is not always the case (cf. systems with emerging properties; e.g. conscience).

## Defeasible reasoning
Defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning in which tentative (uncertain, provisional) conclusions are drawn with the possibility to retract them based on further evidence.

## Monotonic reasoning
Monotonicity of entailment means that adding a new premise does not affect the derived conclusion. Monotonicity is a property of the entailment relation of logic systems. As a mode of reasoning, it means that learning a new piece of information cannot reduce what is already known.

## Non-monotonic reasoning
Non-monotonic reasoning, and by it induced non-monotonic logic, is a logic system in which the entailment relation is not monotonic. Therefore, in non-monotonic reasoning, adding a new premise affects the derived conclusion. Non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible reasoning.
