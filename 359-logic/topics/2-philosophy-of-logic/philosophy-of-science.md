*Idealism*: everything is mind-dependent. Things-in-themselves are not accessible. "To be is to be perceived" -- Barkely. Everything perceived is an idea. "The world is such as ideas are made of."

*Positivism*: the only valid knowledge is knowledge gained through the scientific method, independent of religion or metaphysics.. Auguste Comte, a XIX century philosopher, is most famous for his Law of Three Stages: Theological, Metaphysical, and Positive. He was a pioneer of sociology and the father of positivism, a way of looking at the world based exclusively on scientific evidence independent of religion or metaphysics.

*Scientific realism* became dominant in philosophy of science after the demise of the forms of *antirealism* about science associated with the *logical positivists*, namely *semantic instrumentalism*, according to which **theoretical terms** are not to be interpreted as referring to anything, and theoretical reductionism, according to which theoretical terms are disguised ways of referring to observable phenomena.

*Causal essentialism* is the doctrine that the causal relations that properties bear to other properties exhaust their natures.

One explanation of *theoreticity* says that a term is theoretical iff it refers to nonobservational entities. Paradigmatic examples of such entities are electrons, neutrinos, gravitational forces, genes etc. Another explanation says that a **theoretical term** is one whose meaning becomes determined through the axioms of a scientific theory. The meaning of the term 'force', for example, is seen to be determined by Newton's laws of motion and further laws about special forces, such as the law of gravitation. **Theoreticity** is a property that is commonly applied to both expressions in the language of science, and referents and concepts of such expressions. Objects, relations and functions as well as concepts thereof may thus qualify as theoretical in a derived sense.

**Logical atomism** is a philosophical view that originated in the early 20th century with the development of analytic philosophy, that holds that the world consists of ultimate logical "facts" (or "atoms") that cannot be broken down any further, each of which can be understood independently of other facts.

**Physicalism** is a revised version of materialism. On this view, the world is merely comprised of physical things and their respective causal relationships which govern their behavior. Physicalism stated that everything that exists or
happens can be completely described in the vocabulary of physics.

**Fideism** is an epistemological theory which maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other, and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). The word "fideism" comes from `fides`, the Latin word for faith, and literally means "faith-ism". Philosophers have identified a number of different forms of fideism.

**Quietism** in philosophy sees the role of philosophy as broadly therapeutic or remedial. Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy. For quietists, advancing knowledge or settling debates (particularly those between realists and non-realists) is not the job of philosophy, rather philosophy should liberate the mind by diagnosing confusing concepts.
