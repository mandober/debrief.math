# Informal fallacy

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy

*Informal fallacies* are a type of incorrect argument in natural language. The source of the error is not just due to the form of the argument, as is the case for *formal fallacies*, but can also be due to their content and context.

Despite being incorrect, fallacies appear as correct. Their misleading appearance often has to do with various aspects of natural language and communication, including ambiguous or vague expressions, ellipses, absence of explicit assumptions, implicit presuppositions.

Many informal fallacies have been identified including
- fallacy of equivocation
- fallacy of amphiboly¹ (syntactic ambiguity)
- fallacies of composition and division
- false dilemma
- begging the question
- ad hominem
- appeal to ignorance

  ¹ Note: *amphi·boly* (or amphi·bology, amphi·bologie) means ambiguity, but this specific term is used to denote ambiguous grammatical constructions, such as "She sees more of her children than her husband". Strictly speaking, in an amphiboly, the individual words are not ambiguous - the ambiguity arises entirely from the way in which they are combined.



There is no general agreement how fallacies are classified. 
One approach is to distinguish between
- fallacies of ambiguity, which have their root in ambiguous or vague language
- fallacies of presumption, which involve false or unjustified premises
- fallacies of relevance, in which the premises are not relevant to the conclusion despite the appearance

The traditional approach to fallacies has received a lot of criticism in contemporary philosophy. This criticism is often based on the argument that the alleged fallacies are not fallacious at all, or at least not in all cases. To overcome this problem, alternative approaches for conceiving arguments and fallacies have been proposed.

These include the *dialogical approach*, which conceives arguments as moves in a *dialogue-game* aimed at rationally persuading the other person. This game is governed by various rules. Fallacies are defined as violations of the dialogue rules impeding the progress of the dialogue.

The *epistemic approach* constitutes another framework. Its core idea is that arguments play an epistemic role: they aim to expand our knowledge by providing a bridge from already justified beliefs to not yet justified beliefs. Fallacies are arguments that fall short of this goal by breaking a rule of *epistemic justification*.

In the *Bayesian approach*, the epistemic norms are given by the laws of probability, which our degrees of belief should track.


The study of fallacies aims at providing an account for evaluating and criticizing arguments. This involves both a *descriptive account* of what constitutes an argument, and a *normative account* of which arguments are valid.

In philosophy, fallacies are usually seen as a form of bad argument (and are discussed as such in this article). Another conception, more common in non-scholarly discourse, sees fallacies not as arguments, but rather as false, yet popular, beliefs.
