E is a theorem prover for full first-order logic with equality. It accepts a problem specification, typically consisting of a number of first-order clauses or formulas, and a conjecture, again either in clausal or full first-order form. The system will then try to find a formal proof for the conjecture, assuming the axioms. If a proof is found, the system can provide a detailed list of proof steps that can be individually verified. If the conjecture is existential (i.e. it is of the form "there exists an X with property P"), more recent versions can also provide possible answers (values for X).
