# Completeness

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness

>A formal system is **complete** if all propositions that are true can be derived in it.

Hilbert's first problem was the *completeness* of arithmetic: is there a way to prove all true propositions within (first-order) arithmetic?

Hilbert's second question was about the *consistency* of arithmetic: is there a way to prove that no contradictory statements arise in arithmetic?

Hilbert's third question was about *decidability* of arithmetic: is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows from the axioms?


*Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem* implies that the truth and provability are not at all the same thing - it states that there will always be some true propositions that cannot be proven with a formal system.

Hilbert could still console himself in the hope that at least we could still prove the consistency of arithmetic; that is, that arithmetic is free of contradictions, but then Gödel published his *Second Incompleteness Theorem* in which he showed that any consistent formal system cannot prove its own consistency.

Taken together, Gödel's incompleteness theorems say that the best one can hope for is a consistent, but incomplete formal system. Since such a system cannot prove its own consistency, contradictions may arise proving the system inconsistent.
