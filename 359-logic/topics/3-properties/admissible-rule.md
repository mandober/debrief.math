# Admissible rule

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_rule

In a formal logic system, a rule of inference is **admissible** if the set of theorems of the system does not change when that rule is added to the existing rules of the system. In other words, every formula that can be derived using that rule is already derivable without that rule, so, in a sense, it is redundant.

The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955).
