# Proof calculus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_calculus

In mathematical logic, a **proof calculus** or a **proof system** is built to prove statements.

A proof system includes the components:
- Language: The set L of formulas admitted by the system
  (e.g. propositional logic or FOL)
- Rules of inference: List of rules that can be employed to prove theorems 
  from axioms and theorems.
- Axioms: Formulas in L assumed to be valid.
  All theorems are derived from axioms.

Usually a given proof calculus encompasses more than a single particular formal system, since many proof calculi are under-determined and can be used for radically different logics. For example, a paradigmatic case is the *sequent calculus*, which can be used to express the consequence relations of both intuitionistic logic and relevance logic.

>Thus, loosely speaking, a proof calculus is a template or design pattern, characterized by a certain style of formal inference, that may be specialized to produce specific formal systems, namely by specifying the actual inference rules for such a system.

There is no consensus among logicians on how best to define the term.

## Examples of proof calculi

The most widely known proof calculi are those classical calculi that are still in widespread use:
- The class of *Hilbert systems*, of which the most famous example is the 1928 Hilbert-Ackermann system of first-order logic
- Gerhard Gentzen's *calculus of natural deduction*, which is the first formalism of *structural proof theory*, and which is the cornerstone of the *formulae-as-types* correspondence relating logic to functional programming
- Gentzen's *sequent calculus*, which is the most studied formalism of structural proof theory

Many other proof calculi were used (but no so much today).
- *Aristotle's syllogistic calculus*, presented in the Organon, readily admits formalisation. There is still some modern interest in syllogisms, carried out under the aegis of *term logic*.
- Gottlob *Frege's two-dimensional notation* of the `Begriffsschrift` (1879) is usually regarded as introducing the modern concept of quantifier to logic.
- C.S. *Peirce's existential graph* easily might have been seminal, had history worked out differently.

Modern research in logic teems with rival proof calculi. Several systems have been proposed that replace the usual *textual notation* with a *graphical notation* (e.g *proof nets* and *cirquent calculus*).

Recently, many logicians interested in structural proof theory have proposed calculi with *deep inference*:
- display logic
- hypersequents
- calculus of structures
- calculus of bunched implication
