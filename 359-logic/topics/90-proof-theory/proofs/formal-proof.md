# Formal proof

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof

In logic and mathematics, a **formal proof** or **derivation** is a finite sequence of sentences (called well-formed formulas in the case of a formal language), each of which is an axiom, an assumption, or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a *rule of inference*.

Formal proofs differ from a natural language arguments in that they are *rigorous*, *unambiguous* and *mechanically verifiable*.

If a set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a *theorem* of the formal system. The notion of theorem isn't effective, in general, therefore, there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists.

The concepts of *Fitch-style proof*, *sequent calculus* and *natural deduction* are generalizations of the concept of proof.

A theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus (of some formal system) to the previous well-formed formulas in the proof sequence.

Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in interactive theorem proving (e.g. through the use of proof checker and automated theorem prover). Significantly, these proofs can be checked automatically, also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of finding proofs, i.e. *automated theorem proving*, is usually computationally intractable and/or only semi-decidable, depending upon the formal system.
