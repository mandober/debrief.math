The single, most essential notion central to logic is that of *reasoning*, which is a cognitive processes used to discover new information based on the existing knowledge. Of the numerous ways of reasoning (analogical, associative, case-based, commonsense, counterfactual, cause-and-effect, default reasoning, etc.), which are studied in philosophy, psychology and other sciences, logic is primarily concerned with *logical reasoning*, which is a cognitive processes also used to *derive new information from the existing knowledge*, but in a way that is supported by logic.

Logic has identified 3 types of logical reasoning according to the *certainty of the conclusions*: *inductive*, *abductive* and *deductive* reasoning, each with a different level of assurance.

The truth of deductive arguments is the absolute, universal, *necessary truth* - deductive conclusions are true in all *possible worlds*. Deduction deals with *necessity*, with the necessary truth, and is thus favored in logic. *All formal systems of logic are deductive*.

The truth of non-deductive conclusions, of induction and *abduction*, cannot be guaranteed and is only a matter of possibility or probability at best. Induction deals with *contingency* - with the *contigent truth* - and is thus underrepresented, along with abduction, which deals with the truth as to the best explanation.

*Induction* is sporadically mentioned when exploring argumentation as the alternative, "inferior" method of deriving new information - which is curious since only induction allows us to obtain new information; deductive conclusions do not increase our knowledge. However, though it has been tried, no inductive systems of logic exists, let alone abductive systems.

Logic strudies *correct logical reasoning*; it is interested in the correct ways of inference. *Inference* is the process of deriving new facts from the existing information.
