# Logic :: About :: Preface

This section tries to present logic and its numerous topics in a logical way, by starting with the most elementary notions and organically building upon them. Here, "organically" means that one paragraph should provoke the next. At least that is the ideal method of exposition.

An alternative approach is one-page-per-topic, Ã  la Wikipedia, consisting of a bunch of pages dumped in the `wiki` folder; this name is a remained of the origin of the articles. Unlike what is attempted in this approach, the topics in there are not sufficiently - or at all - digested; pages in there are often just verbatim (or sometimes bad) copies of their respective Wikipedia articles. This is actually the intended workflow: get acquainted with a new topic (from a book), snort relevant wikipedia articles verbatim, then go through motions to digest each topic, form clustered bigger topics when its concepts are sufficiently understood. See to always write things down, to helpl better instill the knowledge, to retain it "on paper", and to practice writing prose in English.
