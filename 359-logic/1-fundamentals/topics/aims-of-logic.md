# Logic :: About :: Aims of logic

Logic is part of philosophy and so it is one of the oldest sciences. The subject matter of logic is the study of correct reasoning and good arguments.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations; he envisioned a *universal language* using which people would be able to resolve their disagreements. As Leibniz put it: "The only way to rectify our reasoning is to make it as tangible as those of mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we could simply say - *calculemus!* ("let us calculate"), to see who is right".

Logic is about *correct reasoning*, but this traditional goal of logic, to canonize the ways to reason correctly and to teach it to people, has in modern age turned out to be too an ingrateful task so it was adjusted to a more resonable one - teaching computers instead.

Another motivation that has also come with the advent of computers is to make a *database of all human knowledge*. However, instead of feeding all knowledge to a computer, which would be nearly impossible, it is tought that an easier task would be to *teach computers how to reason*. That way we could only give it a small amount of essential fact and let it derive other facts from it.

The goal of logic is to *canonize correct ways of reasoning and argumentation*, possibly showing people the correct ways of reasoning, and to try to teach computers how to reason, or at least to teach computers how to reason well enough, so we don't have to store the entirety of human knowledge in databases but still be able to make computer-assisted quaries, while hopefully also having computers that can derive new facts from the existing ones.

It is strange that the task of performing correct inferences would be a difficult task to teach it to a computer, considering that many logicians qualify the act of performing inferences as a purely mechanical process. Perhaps the problem seems difficult because it is impossible to treach people the same, judging by the number and width of the classification of logical fallicies, and the quality of statements made by politicians; if we also take public debates on TV into account, it becomes evident that (some) people will always be ignorant to logic (which is different from those rare politicians that actually do recognize fallicies in logical reasoning, but nevertheless choose to ignore them for some benefit). Computers on the other hand are way more moldable ⟨so everything is not yet lost⟩.

In any case, the important goal is to come up with a *formal symbolic language*, like the *universal language* that Leibniz dreamt of. Having such a language, instead of dealing with a natural language, would bring simplicity and, most of all, *unambiguity*, which is the quality that no natural language has. Moreover, a symbolic language would be more amenable to program it into computers.
