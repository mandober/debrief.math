# Logic within mathematics

Logic was always a part of philosophy, from the ancient times to nowadays, and only since XIX century logic became a part of mathematics, as *mathematical logic*, which is of our primary interest here (so we usually refer to it by just "logic").

*Philosophical logic*

Mathematical logic is the use of mathematics top analyse formal languages, formal semantics, proof systems.


In one common classification of mathematics, the field of mathematical logic (ML) comprises 4 subfields: set theory, model theory, proof theory, and computability (recursion) theory. In this case, ML is not just an umbrella class for these 4 subfields, but it itself is comprised of an enourmous number of topics about logic.

Almost all subjects in mathematics bleed into each other, making precise classification difficult. For example, computability theory is primarily a subfield of the theory of computation (TOC), and secondarily of ML. TOC and ML both belong to *discrete mathematics* along with many others theories including set theory, which in turn includes theories such as relation theory, order theory, domain theory, function theory. This overlap of subjects makes precise classification of mathematics difficult, so most classification schemes have no choice but to let some theories appear multiple times, in different classes.
