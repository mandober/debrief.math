The *laws of logic* give us the basic rules for manipulating basic terms, which are essential verbal skills for doing logical reasoning.

A law of logic (better *identity of logic* since laws are things like LEM, LNC, EFQ, etc.) is an abstract compound statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its *component statements*.

For example, `p ∨ ¬p` is always true, so it is a law of logic. On the other hand, `p ∨ ¬q` is not always true, so it is not a law of logic.

- LEM: `p ∨ ¬p`
- LNC: `¬(p ∧ ¬p)` (p ↑ ¬p ≡ p ∨ ¬p)
- DML: p ∙ q = ¬(p̅ ∙̅ q̅)     where bar means flip (∧′=∨, ∨′=∧, 0′=1, 1′=0)
       p ∙ q = ¬(p′ ∙′ q′)  where ′ means flip
