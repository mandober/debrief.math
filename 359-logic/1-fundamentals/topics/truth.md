## Truth-functional logic

Premises and conclusions express propositions. An important feature of *propositions* is their *internal structure*. For example, *complex propositions* are made up of simpler propositions linked by logical vocabulary like ∧ (and) or → (if...then). *Simple propositions* also have parts, like "Sunday" or "work" in the example. The *truth of a proposition* usually depends on the meanings of all of its parts. However, this is not the case for *logically true propositions*. They are true only because of their *logical structure* independent of their other parts.

## Propositions and truth values

Example: "The current Emperor of Kentucky is gray"

This expression does not meant that there is some individual, namely the current Emperor of Kentucky, who has the property of being gray; Kentucky was never a monarchy, so there is no Emperor at all.

Russell wants to avoid admitting mysterious nonexistent objects into his theory.

Furthermore, the Law of Excluded Middle requires that one of the propositions must be true:
- either, "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray"
- or, "it is not the case that the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray"

>Normally, propositions of the subject-predicate form are said to be true iff the subject is in the extension of the predicate.

But, there is currently no Emperor of Kentucky. So, *since the subject does not exist, it is not in the extension of either predicate* (it is not on the list of gray people or non-gray people).

Thus, it appears that this is a case in which the law of excluded middle is violated, which is also an indication that something has gone wrong.

In philosophy and logic, *contingency* is the status of propositions that are neither true under every possible valuation (i.e. tautologies) nor false under every possible valuation (i.e. contradictions). A contingent proposition is neither necessarily true nor necessarily false.

Lebnitz division of propositions:
- truths of reason
- truths of fact


A **theory** is a set of axioms together with all statements derivable from them. Or, a set of statements which are *deductively closed*. Equivalently, a theory is a *formal language* with a set of *axioms*, from which *theorems* can be derived. The formulas expressing theorems are usually required to be closed, i.e. that all variables are bound. A theory is *consistent* if it has a *model*.

A **mathematical theory** is a field of study of mathematics attempting to exhaustively describe a particular class of objects and constructs.
