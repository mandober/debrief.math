# Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz believed that much of human reasoning could be reduced to calculations; he envisioned a *universal language* using which people would be able to resolve their disagreements. As Leibniz put it: "The only way to rectify our reasoning is to make it as tangible as those of mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we could simply say - *calculemus!* ("let us calculate"), to see who is right".


**Salva veritate** or **intersubstitutivity** is the logical condition by which two expressions may be interchanged without altering the truth-value of statements in which the expressions occur. Substitution salva veritate of co-extensional terms can fail in opaque contexts.

The phrase occurs in two fragments from Gottfried Leibniz's General Science. Characteristics:
* In Chapter 19, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Two terms are the same (eadem) if one can be substituted for the other without altering the truth of any statement (salva veritate)."
* In Chapter 20, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Terms which can be substituted for one another wherever we please without altering the truth of any statement (salva veritate), are the same (eadem) or coincident (coincidentia). For example, 'triangle' and 'trilateral', for in every proposition demonstrated by Euclid concerning 'triangle', 'trilateral' can be substituted without loss of truth (salva veritate)."

**Salva Congruitate** is used in logic to mean that two terms may be substituted for each other while preserving grammaticality in all contexts.

*Lingua generalis* was an essay written by Gottfried Leibniz in February, 1678 in which he presented a philosophical language he created, which he named lingua generalis or *lingua universalis*. Leibniz aimed for his lingua universalis to be adopted as a universal language and be used for calculations. As a result of this work, he developed *binary calculus*.


*Characteristica universalis*, commonly interpreted as *universal characteristic*, or universal character, is a *universal and formal language* imagined by Gottfried Leibniz able to express mathematical, scientific, and metaphysical concepts. Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a *universal logical calculation* or *calculus ratiocinator*. The concept is sometimes paired with his notion of a calculus ratiocinator and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a **compendium of all human knowledge**.

Many Leibniz scholars writing in English seem to agree that he intended his characteristica universalis or "universal character" to be a form of pasigraphy, or ideographic language. This was to be based on a rationalised version of the 'principles' of Chinese characters, as Europeans understood these characters in the seventeenth century. From this perspective it is common to find the characteristica universalis associated with contemporary universal language projects like Esperanto, auxiliary languages like Interlingua, and formal logic projects like Frege's Begriffsschrift. The global expansion of European commerce in Leibniz's time provided mercantilist motivations for a universal language of trade so that traders could communicate with any natural language.

Others, such as Jaenecke, for example, have observed that Leibniz also had other intentions for the characteristica universalis, and these aspects appear to be a source of the aforementioned vagueness and inconsistency in modern interpretations. According to Jaenecke:

    The Leibniz project is not a matter of logic but rather one of knowledge representation, a field largely unexploited in today's logic-oriented epistemology and philosophy of science. It is precisely this one-sided orientation of these disciplines, which is responsible for the distorted picture of Leibniz's work found in the literature. - Jaenecke 1996

As Louis Couturat wrote, Leibniz criticized the linguistic systems of George Dalgarno and John Wilkins for this reason since they focused on

    ...practical uses rather than scientific utility, that is, for being chiefly artificial languages intended for international communication and not philosophical languages that would express the logical relations of concepts. He favors, and opposes to them, the true "real characteristic", which would express the composition of concepts by the combination of signs representing their simple elements, such that the correspondence between composite ideas and their symbols would be natural and no longer conventional. - Couturat, 1901, chpt. 3

## A universal language of science

Leibniz said that his goal was an alphabet of human thought, a universal symbolic language (characteristic) for science, mathematics, and metaphysics.
