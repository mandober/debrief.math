# Logic :: Definitions of logic

Logic isâ€¦
* a formal science of reasoning and argumentation.
* the study of arguments and the truth itself.
* the study of the criteria for evaluating correct arguments.
* the study of correct reasoning or good arguments.
* trying to identify and classify rules of inference.
* the science of deductively valid inferences and logical truths.
* Logic is the basis of all mathematical reasoning, and of all automated reasoning. The rules of logic specify the meaning of mathematical statements.



Logic investigates the structure of statements and arguments through the study of formal systems and the associated rules of inference, as well as the study of arguments in a natural language setting.

The scope of logical study ranges from the core topics that include fallacies and paradoxes, to the specialized topics related to the analyses of reasoning, such as probability, correct reasoning and argumentation.

Logic is considered a branch of philosophy and mathematics, and by extension, of computer science as well.

## Definitions of a system of logic

* In the most general sense, a *system of logic* is a set endowed with a logical consequence relation. Translattions between logical systems are morphisms that preserce the logical consequence relation.
