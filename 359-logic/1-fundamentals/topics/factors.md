In philosophy and logic, a **deflationary theory of truth**, also *semantic deflationism*, is one of a family of theories that all have in common the claim that assertions of predicate truth of a statement do not attribute a property called "truth" to such a statement. Gottlob Frege was the first to note that predicating truth or existence does not express anything above and beyond the statement to which it is attributed.

According to the **redundancy theory of truth**, also known as the *disquotational theory of truth*, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. For example, asserting the sentence "'Snow is white' is true" is equivalent to asserting the sentence "Snow is white". The philosophical redundancy theory of truth is a *deflationary theory of truth*.
