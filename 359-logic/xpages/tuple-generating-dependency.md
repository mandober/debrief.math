# Tuple-generating dependency

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple-generating_dependency

In relational database theory, a tuple-generating dependency (TGD) is a certain kind of constraint on a relational database. It is a subclass of the class of embedded dependencies (EDs).

An algorithm known as the chase takes as input an instance that may or may not satisfy a set of TGDs (or more generally EDs) and, if it terminates (which is a priori undecidable), outputs an instance that does satisfy the TGDs.
