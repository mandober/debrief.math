# Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov_interpretation

**Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov (BHK) interpretation of intuitionistic logic**, proposed by L. E. J. Brouwer and Arend Heyting, and independently by Andrey Kolmogorov, and also called the **realizability interpretation** due to its close connection to the *realizability theory* of Stephen Kleene, is the standard explanation of intuitionistic logic (IL) in terms of the *constructivist* view of mathematics.

Unlike the classical or formalists view of mathematics, constructivist view insists that each proof has a witnessing element. It is not enough to just state the existence of such element - a witness has to be produced, otherwise the theorem is unacceptable in constructivists view, under which a proof procedure is like algorithm that must not only produce the proof in general, but a concrete element that serves as evidence. Formalist's view has no such strict requirements and gladly accepts theorems that can't put the money where they mouth is.

## B-H-K Interpretation

Constructivist's view of mathematics is present in intuitionistic logic as the BHK interpretation that specifies exactly what is excepted of propositions (usually represented by symbols, in formulas) joined by each logical connective.

The BHK interpretation states what precisely constitutes a proof of a given logic formula (specified by induction on the structure of that formula).

* *Conjunction*: a proof of `P ‚àß Q` is a pair `‚ü®a,b‚ü©`, where `a` is a proof of `P`, and `b` is a proof of `Q`.

P ‚àß Q proof: ‚ü®a, b‚ü©

* *Disjunction*: a proof of `P ‚à® Q` is either `‚ü®0, a‚ü©`, where `a` is a proof of `P`, or a pair `‚ü®1, b‚ü©`, where `b` is a proof of `Q`.

P ‚à® Q proof: ‚ü®0, a‚ü© or ‚ü®1, b‚ü©




* A proof of `P ‚Üí Q` is a function `f` that converts a proof of `P` into a proof of `Q`.

* A proof of `‚àÉx ‚àà S.P(x)` is a pair `(x,a)` where `x` is an element of `S` and `a` is a proof of `P`.
* A proof of `‚àÄx ‚àà S.P(x)` is a function `f` that converts an element `x` of `S` into a proof of `P`.

* The formula `¬¨P` is defined as `P ‚Üí ‚ä•`, so a proof of it is a function `f` that converts a proof of `P` into a proof of `‚ä•`.

* There is no proof of `‚ä•` (absurdity, bottom type), that is used to represent nontermination in some FPLs.



The disjunction is interpreted as a *disjoint (tagged) union*, which is like a union except it prevents collapse of the same elements (e.g. 2 collapses when these two sets are unionized, `{1,2} ‚ãÉ {2,3} = {1,2,3}`). To force this behaviour, each set is first tagged. Boolean domain, `ùîπ`, has two elements, so it comes handy when two sets are to be joined. Instead of doing `X ‚ãÉ Y`, this is done instead, `(X‚Åü‚®Ø‚Åüùîπ) ‚ãÉ (Y‚Åü‚®Ø‚Åüùîπ)`.

X = {1,2}, Y = {2,3}

union: X ‚ãÉ Y = {1,2,3} ‚úî

disjoint union:


(  X   ‚®Ø   ùîπ)   ‚ãÉ (  Y   ‚®Ø   ùîπ  ) ‚úò
({1,2} ‚®Ø {f,t}) ‚ãÉ ({2,3} ‚®Ø {f,t}) ‚úò

{1,2} ‚®Ø {f,t} = { (1,f), (1,t), (2,f), (2,t) } ‚úò
{1,2} ‚®Ø {f} = { (1,f), (2,f) } ‚úî
{2,3} ‚®Ø {t} = { (2,t), (3,t) } ‚úî
         ‚Üë
        how



and the terms of this type are pairs that have a tag as their first component, which is used to distinguish terms and to specify which disjunct is present in the term (which disjunct is the pair's component proof of). In the example, `0` is used to tag the left disjunct (left variant), i.e. to tag `P` (0 indicates the left conjunct is prsent)

, while `1` tags the right disjunct, i.e. it is a `Q`. Instead of 0 and 1, the tags which are often used are "left" and "right", despite being more verbose. In fact, we say that a sum type (set) is indexed by the Boolean type (or another 2-set, they are all isomorphic).

The interpretation of a primitive proposition is supposed to be known from context. In the context of arithmetic, a proof of the formula `x=y` is a computation reducing the two terms to the same numeral.

Kolmogorov followed the same lines but phrased his interpretation in terms of problems and solutions. To assert a formula is to claim to know a solution to the problem represented by that formula. For instance, `P ‚Üí Q` is the problem of reducing `Q` to `P`; to solve it requires a method to solve problem `Q` given a solution to problem `P`.


## Examples

*The identity function* is a proof of `P ‚Üí P`, no matter what `P` is.

*The law of non-contradiction*, `¬¨(P ‚àß ¬¨P)`, expands to `(P ‚àß (P ‚Üí ‚ä•)) ‚Üí ‚ä•`:
- A proof of `(P ‚àß (P ‚Üí ‚ä•)) -> ‚ä•` 
  is a function `lnc` that converts 
  a proof of `(P ‚àß (P ‚Üí ‚ä•))` 
  into a proof of `‚ä•`.
- A proof of `P ‚ãÄ (P ‚Üí ‚ä•)` 
  is a pair of proofs `(a,‚Äâ b)`, 
  where `a` is a proof of `P`, 
  and `b` is a proof of `(P ‚Üí ‚ä•)`.
- A proof of `P -> ‚ä•` is a function `b` that 
  converts a proof of `P` into a proof of `‚ä•`.


```

----------------------------------

lnc converts a proof of "P ‚ãÄ ( P -> ‚üò )"
       ‚îÇ       into a proof of ‚üò
       ‚îÇ              ‚îÇ
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê   ‚îå‚î¥‚îê

    ‚îÇ f converts
    ‚îÇ a proof of P
    ‚îÇ        ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ     into a proof of ‚üò
  (p,f)
```

There is a function `lnc` that does this, where `lnc (a,b) = b(a)`, proving the law of non-contradiction, no matter what `P` is.

```hs
--    (P ‚ãÄ (P -> ‚üò)) -> ‚üò
lnc : (P ‚®â (P -> ‚üò)) -> ‚üò
lnc (a, b) = b a
```

The same reasoning provides a proof for `(P ‚àß (P ‚Üí Q)) ‚Üí Q` as well, where `Q` is any proposition.

On the other hand, *the law of excluded middle*, `P ‚à® ¬¨P`, expands into the formula `P ‚à® (P ‚Üí ‚ä•)` and, in general, has no proof. 
According to the BHK interpretation, 
a proof of `P ‚à® ¬¨P` is a pair `(a,‚Äâb)` 
where `a` is 0 (left) and `b` is a proof of `P`, 
or, `a` is 1 (right) and `b` is a proof of `P ‚Üí ‚ä•`. 
Thus, if neither `P` nor `P ‚Üí ‚ä•` is provable 
then neither is `P ‚à® ¬¨P`.


## Absurdity

In general, it's not possible for a logical system to have a formal negation operator such that there is a proof of "not P" exactly when there isn't a proof of "P" (see G√∂del's incompleteness theorems).

The BHK interpretation instead takes `¬¨P` to mean that `P` leads to absurdity, designated `‚ä•`, so that a proof of `P` is a function converting a proof of `P` into a proof of absurdity, i.e. `¬¨P` := `P ‚Üí ‚ä•`.

A standard example of absurdity is found in dealing with arithmetic. 

Consider the equation `m = n`, 
and its instance where `m = 0` and `n = 1 = S 0`, 
that is, `0 = 1` or `0 = S 0`.

Using mathematical induction on `n`:
- `(P‚Åü0 ‚ãÄ (P‚Åün -> P‚Åü(S n))) -> P‚Åün`, 
  we get that `P` is `(0 =)` so 
  `(0‚Åü=‚Åü0 ‚ãÄ (0‚Åü=‚Åün -> 0‚Åü=‚ÅüS‚Åün)) -> 0‚Åü=‚Åün`
       ‚Üë       ‚Üë       ‚Üë          ‚Üë
- We first prove the base case, `0 = 0`, i.e. that `P 0` holds.
  We invoke the axiom of equality ("refl") to prove this.
- Then we consider the inductive case, `0‚Åü=‚Åün -> n‚Åü=‚ÅüS‚Åün`.
  That is, assuming the case `P(n)` holds, 
  we need to prove that `P(Sn)` holds, `P(n) -> P(S n)`, 
  so it amounts to the formula `0‚Åü=‚Åün -> 0‚Åü=‚ÅüS‚Åün`
- Now induction hypothesis, 
  if 0 were equal to a certain natural number `n`, 
  then `n` (or 0?) would be equal to `S n`, 
  (Peano axiom: `S m = S n ‚áî m = n`), 
  But since `0‚Äâ=‚Äâ1`, thus 0 would also be equal to `S n`. 
  By induction, 0 is equal to all numbers, 
  and therefore any two natural numbers become equal.


Therefore, there is a way to go from a proof of `0‚Äâ=‚Äâ1` to a proof of any basic arithmetic equality, and thus to a proof of any complex arithmetic proposition. Furthermore, to get this result it was not necessary to invoke the Peano axiom that states that 0 is "not" the successor of any natural number.

This makes `0‚Äâ=‚Äâ1` suitable as `‚ä•` in *Heyting arithmetic* (and the Peano axiom is rewritten `0‚Åü=‚ÅüS‚Åün -> 0‚Åü=‚ÅüS‚Åü0`). This use of `0‚Äâ=‚Äâ1` validates the principle of explosion.


## What is a function

The BHK interpretation will depend on the view taken about what constitutes a *function* that converts one proof to another, or that converts an element of a domain to a proof. Different versions of [constructivism][24] will diverge on this point.

Kleene's [realizability][25] theory identifies the functions with the [computable functions][26]. It deals with Heyting arithmetic, where the domain of quantification is the natural numbers and the primitive propositions are of the form *x* = *y*. A proof of *x* = *y* is simply the trivial algorithm if *x* evaluates to the same number that *y* does (which is always decidable for natural numbers), otherwise there is no proof. These are then built up by induction into more complex algorithms.

If one takes [lambda calculus][27] as defining the notion of a function, then the BHK interpretation describes the [correspondence][28] between natural deduction and functions.
