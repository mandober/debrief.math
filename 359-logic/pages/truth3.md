## Truth in logic

Logic is concerned with the patterns in reason that can help tell us if a proposition is true or not. Logicians use formal languages to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such *there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system*.

A *logical truth* (also called an `analytic truth` or a `necessary truth`) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a *fact* (also called a `synthetic claim` or a `contingency`) which is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded.

A proposition such as "If p and q, then p" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the symbols and words in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. *They are such that they could not be untrue*.

Degrees of truth in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with bivalent logic (or binary logic), three-valued logic, and other forms of finite-valued logic. Truth in logic can be represented using numbers comprising a continuous range, typically between 0 and 1, as with fuzzy logic and other forms of infinite-valued logic. In general, the concept of representing truth using more than two values is known as many-valued logic.
