# Domain of discourse

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse

In the formal sciences, the **domain of discourse** (also called the universe of discourse, universal set, or simply universe) is the set of entities over which certain variables of interest in some formal treatment may range.

The domain of discourse is usually specified in the beginning of a discourse, so there is no need to restate it again unless it is changes.

For example, in an interpretation of first-order logic, the domain of discourse is the set of individuals over which the quantifiers range.

A 'bare proposition' - a proposition with no domain of discourse mentioned is either ambiguous or some particular DOD is assumed.

The term "universe of discourse" generally refers to the collection of objects being discussed in a specific discourse. In model-theoretical semantics, a universe of discourse is the set of entities that a model is based on.
