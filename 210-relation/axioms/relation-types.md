# Types of Relations

Relations
* Relations: terminology
  - (prerequisits) set, dot product, ordered pair
  - domain
  - range
  - image
  - pre-image
  - field: domain ∪ range
* Relations: domain and range
  - heterogeneous relation, A×B
  - homogeneous relation, endorelation, S²
* Relations wrt arity
  - nullary, ()
  - unary, R may be a property, P(x), like P= "is academy award winner"
  - binary, 
  - k-ary, S₁₂ⁿ (xᵢ)
* Relations wrt operations
  - converse (inverse, transpose) relation, R⁻¹
  - composition of relations, R ∘ S (or R ; S)


**Partial Equivalence Relation (PER)**

PER R on a set S is a binary relation that is symmetric and transitive.

## Universal

R = A×B ∨ R = A²
∀ab ∈ A . (a,b) ∈ R
R = {(a,b)}

## Empty
∀ab ∈ A . (a,b) ∉ R, R = ∅
