  + set of symbols, from the alphabet
  + set of strings, well-formed words/formulas
  + set of formation rules


**Formal language** is a set of strings of symbols from an alphabet, along with a set of rules. In other words, a formal language consists of strings, which are composed of symbols in that language's alphabet, called words or formulas and are well-formed according to a particular set of rules.

**Alphabet** of a formal language, denoted by $$\Sigma$$, is a set of symbols from which the strings of the language may be formed.

**String** is a finite sequence made out of concatenated symbols (glyphs, tokens, letters). 

**Well-formed formulas** (wff) or well-formed **words** (or just words in less formal settings), are the well-formed strings built from the well-drawn symbols of an well-defined alphabet.

All this wellness is just to ensure that not any old sequence of items (strokes making up the symbols, symbols making up the words, particular sequence of words) is admitted to the language without previous consideration and consensus.

A formal language is often defined by means of a **formal grammar**, also called **formation rule**, such as *regular* or *context-free* grammar. 

Formal syntax of a language consists of 2 layers:
- lexical
- grammar

Syntax encompasses form, format, well-formedness, compositional structure.

Semantics concerns meaning and interpretation of the language.

Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a *word*, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called *well-formed words* or *well-formed formulas*.

A formal language is often defined by means of a *formal grammar* such as a *regular grammar* or *context-free grammar*, which consists of its *formation rules*.

The field of **formal language theory** studies primarily the purely syntactical aspects of such languages i.e their internal structural patterns.

Formal language theory sprang out of *linguistics*, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of natural languages.

In *computer science*, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or semantics.

In *computational complexity theory*, decision problems are typically defined as formal languages, and complexity classes are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power.

In *logic* and the *foundations of mathematics*, formal languages are used to represent the syntax of axiomatic systems. *Mathematical formalism* is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.


## Formal language
- Set of finite strings of atomic symbols
- Set of symbols is called the alphabet
- Strings of symbols are written one symbol after another
- Empty string is denoted by ""
- Some strings belong to a particular language, the others (if any) do not
- The strings that belong to the language are sometimes called "words"
