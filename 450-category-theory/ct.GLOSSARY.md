# Category Theory: GLOSSARY

## Arrow
see morphism

## Category
A category consists of a collection of things and binary relationships (or transitions) between them, such that these relationships can be combined and identified i.e. they include the identity relationship.

## Coterminal object
see initial object

## Final object
see terminal object

## Homset
For all objects `x` and `y` in a category, there is a set called hom-set, `hom(x,y)`, whose elements are morphisms from `x` to `y`.

## Initial object
An initial object (coterminal, universal) in a category `C` is an object `I` in C such that for every object `X` in C there exists precisely one morphism `I -> X`. The dual notion is that of the terminal object.

## Isomorphism
An isomorphism is an invertible morphism, hence a morphism with an inverse morphism. It is a generalization of the concept of bijective functions.

## Morphism
A morphism is a directed arrow (representing a relation) between two objects. A morphism is an element of a hom-set.

## Null object
see zero object

## Strict initial object
A strict initial object is an initial object whose every inbound morphism is an isomorphism.

## Strict terminal object
A strict terminal object is a terminal object whose every outbound morphism is an isomorphism.

## Terminal object
An terminal object in a category `C` is an object `T` in C such that for every object `X` in C there exists precisely one morphism `X -> T`. The dual notion is that of the initial object.

## Universal object
see initial object

## Zero object
A zero object (null object) is an object that is both initial and terminal.
