Category theory has been around for about half a century now, invented in the 1940's by Eilenberg and MacLane. Eilenberg was an algebraic topologist and MacLane was an algebraist. They realized that they were doing the same calculations in different areas of mathematics, which led them to develop category theory.

Category theory is really about building bridges between different areas of mathematics.
