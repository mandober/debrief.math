# Universal construction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_construction

A universal construction is a common construction in category theory for defining entities in terms of their relations to other entities.

[as Bartosz puts it] Considering 
One way to do it, is to pick a particular pattern made out of objects and morphisms that corresponds to 

and find all occurrences of this pattern in the category. 

For a common pattern (and a large category) there will be lots of "hits". 

The problem is then how to rank them; we need to establish some kind of ranking that will help us discover the best candidate (Google uses PageRank technology for the same problem).
