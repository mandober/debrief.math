## Definition

A category $$C$$ is given by a collection $$C_0$$ of objects and a collection $$C_1$$ of arrows which have the following structure:

Each arrow has a domain and a codomain which are objects. 

One writes

$$f: X \to Y \text{ or } X \stackrel{f} \to Y$$

if $$X$$ is the domain of the arrow $$f$$, and $$Y$$ its codomain.

One also writes 

$$X = dom(f) \text{ and } Y = cod(f)$$
