# Natural transformation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_transformation

In category theory, a *natural transformation* provides a way of transforming one functor into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e. the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved.

Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a *morphism of functors*. Indeed, this intuition can be formalized to define so-called *functor categories*.

Natural transformations are, after categories and functors, one of the most fundamental notions of category theory and consequently appear in the majority of its applications.
