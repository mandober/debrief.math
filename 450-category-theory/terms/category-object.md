# Object in a category

https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/object

A **category** consists of *objects* together with *morphisms* between them.

We may think of objects as the elements of a category and arrows between them in a similary wat to set theory's elements in sets and functions that relate different sets. However, if the set theory is on the ground floor, the category theory is at the penthouse, so everything looks increadibly small. Before, we could examine a set and see that its constituent elements are opaque stanalone objects; now, the sets themselves have become tiny and opaque. Because of that, we used to draw the elements of a set as dots, but now, dots represent (opaque) sets. We cannot examine a set directly, like we did before. However, we can still conclude a lot about objects, just by examining the way they are related to each other.

The Category Theory shifts the focus form a zoomed-in details view to a zoomed-out overall view, which requires a different approach. The objects are now opaque dots and we cannot infer anything about them directly. The only way to gain some insight is to focus on the relations between them. (insert an inappropriate proverb about how the company one keeps speaks about one's virtues).

In the category `Set`, the objects are sets and morphisms are (groups of) functions.
