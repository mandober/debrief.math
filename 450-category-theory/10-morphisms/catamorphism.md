# Catamorphism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamorphism

The concept of catamorphism (Greek: κατά "downwards") denotes the unique homomorphism from an *initial algebra* into some other algebra.

In FP, catamorphisms provide *generalizations of folds of lists* to arbitrary algebraic data types, which can be described as initial algebras. The dual concept is that of *anamorphism that generalize unfolds*.
