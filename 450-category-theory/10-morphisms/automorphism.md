# Automorphism

An endomorphism, which is a morphism whose domain and codomain are the same, that, additionally, is also an isomorphism as well, is an **automorphism**.


An automorphism is a morphism that is both an endomorphism and an isomorphism.

In every category, the automorphisms of an object always form a group, called *the automorphism group of the object*.
