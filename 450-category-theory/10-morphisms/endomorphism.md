# Endomorphism

A morphism `f: A → A`, that is, a morphism with identical source and target objects, is an **endomorphism** of object `A`.

An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism, is an automorphism.


A *split endomorphism* is an *idempotent endomorphism* `f` if `f` admits a decomposition `f = h ∘ g` with `g ∘ h = id`.

In particular, *the Karoubi envelope* of a category splits every idempotent morphism.
