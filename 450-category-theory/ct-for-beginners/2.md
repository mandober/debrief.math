# The objects and arrows in a category

## The objects in S

Object, usually sets, are members of a category, together with a set of arrows. Each object is denoted by a capital letter, $${A, B, C}$$.

These objects are abstract sets - we cannot talk about their elements, so they are often repr by a dot (despite being sets).

All props of objects can be determined from arrows between them.

## The arrows of S

The set of arrows between objects in S

In any category, for any two sets (objects) A and B, there may be 0 or more arrows between them.

In S, arrows are functions.

## External vs Internal Diagrams

Diagrams vs Graphs

Definitions f: A -> B and g: A -> B are external diagrams of maps f and g. They show dom and cod but give us no idea of the their internal structure. In order to diff them, we need to list their graphs along the external diagrams.
