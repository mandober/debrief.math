# Duality

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(category_theory)

In category theory, duality is a correspondence between the properties of a category `C` and the dual properties of the opposite category `Cᴼᴾ`.

Given a statement regarding the category `C`, by interchanging the source and target of each morphism, as well as interchanging the order of composition of the two morphisms, a corresponding dual statement is obtained regarding the opposite category `Cᴼᴾ`.

Duality, as such, is the assertion that truth is invariant under this operation on statements. In other words, if a statement is true about `C`, then its dual statement is true about `Cᴼᴾ`. Also, if a statement is false about `C`, then its dual has to be false about `Cᴼᴾ`.

Given a concrete category `C`, it is often the case that the opposite category `Cᴼᴾ` per se is abstract. `Cᴼᴾ` need not be a category that arises from mathematical practice. In this case, another category `D` is also termed to be in duality with `C`, if `D` and `Cᴼᴾ` are *equivalent as categories*. In the case when `C` and its opposite `Cᴼᴾ` are equivalent, such a category is *self-dual*.
