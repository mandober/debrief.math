# Subcategory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcategory

A subcategory `𝒟` 
of a category `𝒞` 
is defined by restricting 
    the collection of objects in `𝒞` 
to a subcollection of objects in `𝒟` 
and 
    the collection of morphisms in `𝒞` 
to a subcollection of morphisms in `𝒟` 
subject to the requirement that `𝒟` contains:
- domain and codomain of any morphism in `𝒟`, 
- the identity morphism of any object in `𝒟`, and 
- the composite of any composable pair of morphisms in `𝒟`.

For example, there is a subcategory `CRing ⊂ Ring` of commutative unital rings. Both of these form subcategories of the category `Rng` of not-necessarily unital rings and homomorphisms that need not preserve the multiplicative unit.

Any category `𝒞` contains a maximal groupoid, the subcategory containing all of the objects and only those morphisms that are isomorphisms.

A subcategory `S` 
of a category `C` 
is a category 
whose objects are objects in `C` and 
whose morphisms are morphisms in `C`, 
with the same identities and composition of morphisms.

Intuitively, a subcategory of `C` 
is a category obtained from `C` 
by removing some objects and arrows.

A category `C` 
whose objects and arrows are subclasses of those of a category `A`, and 
whose source, target, identities and compositions are those of `A` 
is said to be a *subcategory* of `A`.

A subcategory `C` of a category `A` 
is said to be a **full subcategory** when, 
for all pairs of objects `A` and `B` in `C`, 
if `f : A → B` is an arrow in `A` 
then it is also an arrow in `C`.
A full subcategory of a category `A` 
is determined by objects alone.
