# Equivalence of categories

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_of_categories

In category theory, an **equivalence of categories** is a *relation* between two categories that establishes that they are "essentially the same".

There are numerous examples of *categorical equivalences* from many areas of mathematics. Establishing an equivalence involves demonstrating strong similarities between mathematical structures. In some cases, these structures may appear intuitively unrelated, making the equivalence particularly powerful: it creates the opportunity to "translate" theorems between different kinds of mathematical structures, knowing that the essential meaning of those theorems is preserved under the translation.

If a category is equivalent to the opposite (or dual) of another category, then one speaks of a duality of categories, and says that the two categories are *dually equivalent*.

An equivalence of categories consists of a *functor* between the involved categories, which is required to have an *"inverse" functor*.

However, in contrast to the situation common for isomorphisms in an algebraic setting, *the composite of the functor and its "inverse" is not necessarily the identity mapping*. Instead, it is sufficient that each object be naturally isomorphic to its image under this composition.

Thus one may describe functors as being *"inverse up to isomorphism"*. And indeed, there is a concept of isomorphism of categories where a strict form of inverse functor is required, but this is of much less practical use than the equivalence concept.
