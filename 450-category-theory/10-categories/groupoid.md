# Groupoid

(Definition) A **groupoid** is a category in which all morphisms are isomorphisms.

A *group* is a groupoid with one object.

For any space `X`, its fundamental groupoid `Π₁(X)` is a category whose objects are the points of `X` and whose morphisms are endpoint - preserving homotopy classes of paths.
