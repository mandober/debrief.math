# Forword

This book uses *categorical algebra* to build a unified foundation for the study of mathematics, starting from intuitive descriptions of mathematically and physically common phenomena and advancing to a precise specification of the nature of **categories of sets**.

*Set theory as the algebra of mappings* is introduced and developed as a unifying basis for advanced mathematical subjects such as algebra, geometry, analysis, and combinatorics.

The formal study evolves from general axioms that express universal properties of sums, products, mapping sets, and natural number recursion.

The distinctive features of *Cantorian abstract sets*, as contrasted with the variable and cohesive sets of geometry and analysis, are made explicit and taken as special axioms.

*Functor categories* are introduced to model the variable sets used in geometry and to illustrate the failure of the *axiom of choice*.

## Why Sets for Mathematics

This book is for students who are beginning the study of advanced mathematical subjects such as algebra, geometry, analysis, or combinatorics. A useful foundation for these subjects will be achieved by openly bringing out and studying what they have in common.

A significant part of what is common to all these subjects was made explicit 100 years ago by *Richard Dedekind* and *Georg Cantor*, and another significant part 50 years ago by *Samuel Eilenberg* and *Saunders Mac Lane*. The resulting idea of *categories of sets* is the main content of this book. It is worth the effort to study this idea because it provides a unified guide to approaching constructions and problems in the science of space and quantity.

More specifically, it has become standard practice to *represent an object of mathematical interest as a "structure"* (for example a surface in three-dimensional space). This representation is possible by means of the following two steps:

* First we deplete the object of nearly all content. We could think of an idealized computer memory bank that has been erased, leaving only the pure locations. The bag of pure points resulting from this process was called by Cantor a *Kardinalzahl*, but we will usually refer to it as an **abstract set**.

* Then, just as computers can be wired up in specific ways, *suitable specific mappings between these structureless sets will constitute a structure that reflects the complicated content of a mathematical object*. For example, the midpoint operation in Euclidean geometry is represented as a mapping whose "value" at any pair of points is a special third point.

To explain the basis for these steps there is an important procedure known as the *axiomatic method*; that is, from the ongoing investigation of the ideas of sets and mappings, one can extract a few statements called axioms; experience has shown that these axioms are sufficient for deriving most other true statements by pure logic when that is useful.


The additional century of experience since Cantor has shown the importance of emphasizing some issues such as:

* *Each map needs both an explicit domain and an explicit codomain*; not just a domain (as in the previous formulations of set theory) and not just a codomain (as in type theory).

* *Subsets are not mere sets with a special property but are explicit inclusion maps*. This helps one to realize that many constructions involving subsets are simplified and usefully generalized when applied appropriately to maps that are not necessarily subsets.

* *The algebra of composition satisfies the familiar associative and identity rules*; other basic concepts, such as "belonging-to" (e.g. membership in, and inclusion among, subsets), and the dual "determined-by", are easily expressible as "division" relative to it. It turns out that this adherence to algebra (showing that "foundation" (FoM) does not need a language distinct from that of ordinary mathematics) has broad applicability; it is particularly appropriate in smoothing the transition between *constant and variable sets*.

* Because *functionals* play such a key role in mathematics, the algebra is explicitly strengthened to include the algebra of *evaluation maps* and *induced maps*.
