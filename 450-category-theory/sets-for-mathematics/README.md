## Intro

Advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students need a unified foundation
for their study of mathematics. For the first time in a text, this book uses *categorical algebra* to build such a foundation, starting from intuitive descriptions of mathematically and physically common phenomena and advancing to a precise specification of the nature of categories of sets. Set theory as the algebra of mappings is introduced and developed as a unifying basis for advanced mathematical subjects such as algebra, geometry, analysis, and combinatorics.

The formal study evolves from general axioms that express universal properties of sums, products, mapping sets, and natural number recursion. The distinctive features of *Cantorian abstract sets*, as contrasted with the variable and cohesive sets of geometry and analysis, are made explicit and taken as special axioms. *Functor categories* are introduced to model the variable sets used in geometry and to illustrate the failure of the *axiom of choice*. An appendix provides an explicit introduction to necessary concepts from logic, and an extensive glossary provides a window to the mathematical landscape.


## Desc
The main text is based on courses given several times at Buffalo and Sackville for third-year students of mathematics, computer science, and other mathematical sciences. Although more advanced than the book *Conceptual Mathematics* by Lawvere and Schanuel (which is aimed at total beginners) this text develops from scratch the theory of the *category of abstract sets* and certain other *toposes* with examples from *elementary algebra*, *differential equations*, and *automata theory*.

Among the reasons offered in the appendix for developing an explicit foundation is the need to have a basis for studying such works as Eilenberg-Steenrod on algebraic topology and Grothendieck on *functional analysis* and *algebraic geometry*. Indeed, the appendix lays down a challenging definition of "foundation" which the book itself can only begin to fulfill.

The basic concepts are treated with detailed explanations and with many examples, both in the text and in exercises. After the basics are available, some old topics can be treated in a unifying contemporary spirit, for example

The standard tools for analyzing an arbitrary map are the induced equivalence relation, co-equivalence relation, graph and cograph (cographs have been very frequently pictured in practice but only rarely recognized explicitly); all four of these are shown to arise inevitably as *Kan quantifications*, along the two possible interpretations of the generic map as half of the splitting of a generic idempotent.

The so-called "measurable" cardinals can be excluded from a topos by the intuitive demand that space and quantity have a good duality, made explicit Ã  la Isbell via the requirement that there is a fixed automaton such that the monad obtained by double-dualizing into it is the identity.

The authors hope that this work will serve as one of the springboards to the development and teaching of a foundation suitable for **twenty-first century mathematics**.
