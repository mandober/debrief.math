# Function

Functions are relations with special constraints:
- each member of the domain must be associated
- with at most one element from the codomain

Given two sets A = {0,1,2} and B = {1,2,3,4} a function f that goes from A to B, denoted by f:: A -> B, is defined by the set of the ordered pairs `(x,y)`, where each `x` comes from the domain A, and y is the association of `a` under the function `f` i.e. `y = f(a)`.

If the association is defined as f(a)=a^2, then this function `f` is defined by all the ordered pairs (a,b) that participate in this relation/function, which, concerning the sets A and B, are: `f = { (0,1), (1,1), (2,4) }`.

Note that:
- all elements of A are associated
- each is associated with at most one element in B, i.e. each element of domain is associated with exactly one elements in the codomain; `a` cannot have associations with two different elements in B, like (0,1) and (0,2).
- however, not each element in B needs to participate in this function (e.g. element `3 ∈ B` is not associated at all)
- also, there could be elements in `B` that are associated with more then one element in `A` (e.g. `1 ∈ B` that is associated with `0 and 1 ∈ A`)

Looking at the set of ordered pairs that make up this relation, this means functions cannot have an element of domain appearing more then once as the first component of any pair, i.e. all pair's first components must be different. And each element of doamin must be represented in an ordered pair, as the 1st component.

If the same domain point is mapped to two different codomain points, then either that relation is not a function, or there are two different functions in play.
