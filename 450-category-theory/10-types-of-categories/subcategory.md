# Subcategory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcategory

A subcategory of a category `C` is a category `S` whose objects are objects in `C` and whose morphisms are morphisms in `C`, with the same identities and composition of morphisms.

Intuitively, a subcategory of `C` is a category obtained from `C` by "removing" some of its objects and arrows.

A category `C` whose objects and arrows are subclasses of those of a category `A`, and whose source, target, identities and compositions are those of `A` is said to be a *subcategory* of `A`.

A subcategory `C` of `A` is said to be *full* when, for all pairs of objects `a` and `b` in `C`, if `f : a â†’ b` is an arrow in `A` then it is an arrow also in `C`. A full subcategory of a category `A` is determined by the objects alone.
