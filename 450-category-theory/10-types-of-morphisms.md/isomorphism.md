# Isomorphism

The concept of *isomorphism* and the property of *uniqueness up to an isomorphism*, as well as *uniqueness up to a unique isomorphism*, is often encountered in category theory.

Definition. A morphism `f ∶ a → b` in a category `𝒞` is an isomorphism 
if there is an inverse morphism `f⁻¹ ∶ b → a` such that 
`f⁻¹ ∘ f = 1ᴀ` and `f ∘ f⁻¹ = 1ʙ`

Objects `a` and `b` are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism `f ∶ a → b`.

*Isomorphic objects* are often said to be identical up to isomorphism. Similarly, an object with some property is said to be unique up to isomorphism if every object satisfying the property is isomorphic to it.

In Set category, isomorphisms are bijections.


Isomorphisms are important in category theory since arrow-theoretic descriptions usually determine an object only up to some isomorphism. Thus isomorphisms are the degree of "sameness" that we wish to consider in categories.
