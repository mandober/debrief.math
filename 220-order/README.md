# Order theory

## Orders

Very often we are interested in comparisons between objects, where one object may be less or equal or greater than another in a certain respect.
Size is the most obvious example of such a comparative relation, or order.
But not all such relations are alike in all their properties.
For instance, some comparative relations require any two objects to be comparable, others don’t. (If they do, we call them linear or total).
Some include identity (like ≤) and some exclude it (like <).

- **Preorder**: a relation which is both reflexive and transitive; `Re+Tr`
- **Partial order**: a preorder which is also anti-symmetric; `Re+vS+Tr`
- **Linear (total) order**: a partial order which is also connected. `Re+vS+Tr+Co`
