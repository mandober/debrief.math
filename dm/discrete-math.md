Mathematics can be broadly classified into two categories: continuous and discrete mathematics.

## Continuous Mathematics

**Continuous Mathematics** (CM), based on the *continuous number line of real numbers*, is characterized by the inherent fact that between any two real numbers there is an infinite set of real numbers. In continuous mathematics a function may be plotted as a smooth curve. CM deals with analog, continuous, signals.

## Discrete Mathematics

**Discrete Mathematics** (DM) studies discrete, separate and enumerable mathematical objects and structures.

**Mathematical object** is anything that can be formally defined and used in deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs.

Some common mathematical objects include:
- permutations
- combinations
- partitions
- relations
- functions
- proofs
- theorems
- etc.

In modern math, most mathematical objects are defined in terms of sets.

**Discrete Structures** aid us in modelling the world in a way that enables us to think about it rigorously and computationally.

**Modelling** is used to approximate objects and concepts by identifying and encoding patterns in the data.


**Mathematical structure** on a set is an additional structural object that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set, endowing it with some extra meaning or significance. Structure-preserving relations map structures in domain to equivalent structures in codomain: **homomorphisms** preserve algebraic structures, **homeomorphisms** preserve topological structures, **diffeomorphisms** preserve differential structures.


Since computers operate on discrete bits of data, Discrete Mathematics overlaps with Computer Science in its study of:
- algorithms
- algorithmic complexity
- proofs
- formal language
- automata
- computability
- correctness of programming languages
- automated and assisted theorem proving

Solving a problem computationally requires
- modeling the world
- devising an algorithm
- determining its efficiency and correctness
